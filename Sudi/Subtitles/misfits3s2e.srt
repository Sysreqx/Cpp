What the fuck is going on
Since when did you
run around jumping off buildings
Ever since I travelled back
from the future
 So what happens now
 You fall in love with me
You can't die I love you
I'll still be here
Where did you get that
The guy in the mask
 Who is he
 It's you
All that matters is us Here now
 Uh turn me loose baby 
Give me your phone
Come on come on
I ain't got all fucking day
Come on
Give it over
Fuckin' hurt you man
Who the fuck are you
Let him go
Stay there
What's with the mask
Look at this shit
You look like a dick
Uh
Ahh
Let's have a look at you
Ahh
You're a superhero
I know you can't tell me who you are
That's why you have a secret identity
right
Look
it's a bit cheesy but
can I get a photograph of us together
Oh
Oh shit it's broken
Simon
What happened
Someone stamped on my hand
 The city breathing
 The people churning
 The conversating
 The price is what
 The conversating
 This place is heaven
 And if you see them 
I did it
I actually saved someone
I didn't think I could do it
Yeah well you could have been
seriously hurt
If I don't take risks I'll never learn
I'll never become him
Why are you so obsessed
with becoming him
I have to save you
You don't have to do anything
you already saved me
I'll always save you
It's like you're excited about it
If you become him
you're going to leave me
You're gonna travel back in time
and you're gonna die
And if I don't become him
and travel back in time
you're going to die
I can't die in the past
if I'm alive in the present
I don't know anything about this
Terminator time travel bullshit
but even [know that
You're going to stay here with me because
you can dress it up any way you like
but if you travel back in time
you're dumping me and I don't get dumped
So it's not going to happen OK
I didn't mean to upset you
Sorry
How does it feel
It hurts
Good
Look
What's going on
Probation worker told us
to put 'em out or some bollocks
I think we're playing Musical Chairs man
Yea h seems likely
Probation worker's big on party games
Maybe he's changed
Right you sacks of shit here they are
Who are they
Another bunch of fuckups
Right everyone grab a seat
The sooner we start
the sooner we can all fuck off
What is this
It's called preventative intervention
Sounds kinky doesn't it
Oh Jesus
OK they're gonna tell you how
they fucked up and you're gonna tell them
how not to fuck up again so they don't
end up as big a fuckups as you
Think you can manage that
Who's he calling a fuckup there
Right who's first
You you're up
Well come on
 My name's P
 Noone cares
Just get on with it
There's this girl I like
she was in a club I
I pretended to steal her handbag
Why would you pretend
to steal her handbag
So I could give it back to her
Cos girls love it
when you steal their bags yeah
Do you want me to read it from the file
cos it's all in here
I thought if I stole it and said that
I caught the guy that took it
Oooh
Sorry mate go on I thought he'd
finished I thought he'd finished
Saying something about a chicken
or sommat
No
Why would I be daydreaming
about a chicken
Come on
I'm dying to hear how
this thrilling story ends
I thought if I got her her bag back
I thought
I thought I'd be a hero
Jesus Christ
Right whatever
Any pearls of wisdom for him
Knock him out
Er don't go round stealing
other people's handbags
Brilliant
Right you're done
OK Tubs you're next
It won't be like this for ever
You'll meet a girl who likes you
you won't have to steal her bag
You're the guy in the mask
I don't know what you're talking about
It's you I recognise your voice
the cut on your hand
You can't tell anyone
Noone can know
I won't
I won't tell anyone
How did you become a superhero
I want to know everything
We should go for a beer
That isn't a good idea
I think it's best you just forget
you ever met me
Ohhoho hey
Hohoho brilliant
Glad you and your boyfriend are finished
Hope you washed your hands
and your genitals
 I'm not gay
 Hmm
So you were showing each other your cocks
because
We were justlooking
At each other's cocks
It's a perfect Oh
It's a perfectly natural
everyday part of being a gay man
It's like window shopping
Window shopping
We didn't have sex I'm not gay
I didn't say anything
 What's this
 I don't know what is that
What is it
It's fucking
Is it
Haha
Hi
Hey
I bought my first Superman comic
when I was five
And after that I was hooked
My life was so boring and normal
Suddenly there were all these
incredible people
with these amazing powers
doing incredible things
I used to spend hours making up stories
doing the artwork
I've always been obsessed
with superheroes
Now I've actually met one
I'm not sure I'm really a superhero
You wear a costume
and you jump off buildings
And you save people from muggers
Trust me that makes you a superhero
Most people would think I was a freak
Those people are idiots
They don't understand what it means
to be prepared to risk your life
To be prepared to die
for what you believe in
Would you like to be my best friend
Great
What's up with him
He thinks he's got cancer
Wait if he has cancer
won't you have cancer
No because he doesn't have cancer
Honestly there's something new every
week he's like the boy who cried tumour
I have a lump feel it
I don't really wanna fingerfuck your
armpit I think I'm gonna pass on that
No don't
You stop it
Oh
Who the fuck is this
It's me auntie who do you think it is
You've got a twin brother
Well nowt's getting past you
is it today
Check out the big brains
on probation worker here
Why's he wearing a jumpsuit
Becausesometimes
I do my community service
sometimes he does it
We like to mix things up
Keeps it interesting
This isn't a job share
Whoever does the crime
does the boring mindless shit
I have a question right
What if we're conjoined twins yeah with
our heads  they're all mashed together 
and we go out on the town for a few beers
Some bloke sees us and he's like
"Oi you twoheaded fuck"
And he flips out goes mental
and batters the guy
Who does the community service then
Cos they are conjoined
Like one massive head
but with two personalities
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it
All right
I'm going to pretend like I never saw
this because I really can't be arsed
Just make sure one of you turns up
Oh man That's insane
The old conjoined twins mindfuck
works every time doesn't it
What you doing
I'm just talking to Peter
Why
What do you mean
Why were you talking to him
He's my friend
He's your friend
I do have friends you know
Yeah I know I didn't mean it like that
Well what you doing later
I'm going to hang out with Peter
OK
I was gonna see some friends anyway so
You have a secret lair
This is totally superhero
How did you find this place
I didn't find it
It was my future self he lived here
You have a future self
Tell me everything
He's chasing Alisha through the warehouse
He catches her
and he's pointing a gun at her
I'm just waiting up on the roof
I jump as he pulls the trigger
I die saving her
You die
Well if you know it's going to happen
why don't you wear a bulletproof vest
Because if the future me doesn't die
she'll never fall in love with me
as I was then in the present
And if she doesn't fall in love with me
I'll never become my future self
And if I don't become him
I won't be able to save her
and she'll never fall in love with me
It all has to happen
exactly like it happened
It's my destiny
That is so fucking cool
What are you doing
Why is that out
I was just showing it to Peter
 You told him
 It was Peter I saved from the mugger
He recognised me
What so you just tell him everything
It's OK I won't tell anyone
This has got nothing to do with you
Can you just leave
Go
I think you should probably go
Why are you telling him
all this stuff
He's my friend
He's not your friend
you only just met him
We've talked about this I don't want
to see that fucking suit ever again
Do you want any toast
I have to face my destiny alone
OK is that before or after
you have breakfast
Being a superhero is a heavy burden
So now you're calling yourself
a superhero
Right
I have to terminate our relationship
What Why are you talking like that
I have to sacrifice our love
for the greater good
What the fuck has got into you
where's all this coming from
Good bye Alisha
Where are you going
you can't just walk away
Simon
What the fuck are you doing
One day you'll come to see that
I did it all for you
Simon wait
Simon
What did he say exactly
He was talking shit
Like saying we can't be together
Everything was fine
it's like it's just come out of nowhere
What's going on you all right
Her and Simon have split up
What I thought you two
were well loved up
 Yeah so did I
 Oh
Oh
What
I can't I can't tell you
Tell me what
The other day I walked in on Simon
shy stealinghandbag kid
they were in the toilet
I can't tell you Can't
What is it
They were showing each other their cocks
That's bullshit
No I think I know what two blokes
in a public toilet look like
showing each other their knobs
All I'm saying is maybe your boyfriend
is a proud beautiful gay man
He likes to rub and touch
other men's penises
No he's not gay
he's the best shag I ever had
Oh just pretend I'm not here yeah
You know I've got a lot more control
since That was my first time
I'm in full control of me ejaculate now
All blokes say that
Next thing you know you've got come
all over your face and in your hair
That's a lovely image
He's not gay
I'm not saying you turned him
but maybe you did
You're deflecting it's all right
take it out on your Uncle Rudy Do it
Jesus
What the fuck is your problem
 She's deflecting
 Jesus
Did he tell you he split up with me
I'm sure you're really
happy about that
You've got your little friend
all to yourself now
Being a superhero
and having a girlfriend
They don't mix
They never have
Very few superheroes
have successful relationships
He's not a superhero
He's my boyfriend
He was your boyfriend
Fuck you you little prick
What's that
Are you obsessed with him
or something
 What else have you got here
 Get off
What is this
Have you done something to him
What's going on
The kid from yesterday I think
he's done something to Simon
 Woo
 Can you feel it coming
 Woo
 Can you feel it coming
 Woo Can you feel it coming
 Woo Can you feel it coming 
Where's Alisha

 I'm gonna play in my car
 I'm gonna walk nine yards 
You can buy us a drink if you want

What d'you want
A pint of lager
The expensive French stuff
A pint of lager
The expensive French stuff
And a gin and tonic please
A gin and tonic

a little pink umbrella in it
What's wrong with gin and tonic

should go out some time Cheers
The last bloke she was seeing
fell over and broke his hip
She's on the market
What about you
I'm not seeing anyone
How about you
I'll tell my nan you're available
You do that
What's going on
The usual shit
I don't know what I did with my life
before these powers came along
You probably hung out in bars
drinking expensive French lager
talking to goodlooking guys
Something like that
Kelly
Thanks for the drink
Any time
You made Simon break up with me
didn't you
I had to
You don't understand
It all has to happen
We ain't debating it with you
It's over

When I see that fucker in the mask
I'm going to beat the shit out of him
Ah the guy in the mask
I think I know who he is
I know who he is
Who is it
It's the probation worker
The probation worker
Yeah cos that would be fucking
ridiculous wouldn't it eh
Because he wouldn't piss on us
if we were on fire
and if he was really desperate
for a piss
Well it's definitely not him
is it
D'you want to stay over at mine
Maybe we should all stay over
Fuck off
Another time maybe
I'll have to pick that up later
Pick it up then
Seriously
Use a bin
Sorry
Sorry that I had to leave the other night
Maybe we could do it again
some other time
Urn I'm kinda busy
What You're busy all the time
Look I can't see you like that
What is it with you
Yesterday you're buying me drinks
talking flirty shit about my nan
And now you're too busy
I'm sorry
Has this got something to do
with the dead girl at the cemetery
How d'you know about that
I saw you leave flowers on her grave
And yeah I followed you cos I fancy ya
Let's just stop all the bullshit
Who is she
She's my girlfriend Or
she was my girlfriend
What happened
She died
A drugs overdose
Before the storm
I was a regular dealer
I gave her the gear
I could've stopped her
She fucking OD'd and it's my fault
I'm sorry yeah
But she's dead
There isn't anything you can do about it
I still love her
I'm sorry
I never meant to mess you about
 Well I own this field
 And I wrote this sky
 And I have no reason
to reason with you 
I don't think he's showing up
This reminds me of when
I met this girl right
And we go back to her flat
and we spent the most
amazing night together
I was head over heels I loved her
more than I ever thought
it was possible to love another
human being Right anyway
in the morning I had to go court
and she makes me promise
that I'd come back So when I were done
I rushed all the way back to her flat
and she's not there
I wait and I wait
But she never comes
Right I went back to that flat
every single day for a month
Sometimes twice
even three times a day But
But she was gone so
 You ever find out what happened to her
 Oh no nothing happened to her man
It turned out I'd been going
to the wrong flat
That is fucking heartbreaking
innit Come on it's all right
Oh piss off
All right Fair enough Look
but don't touch I hear you sweetheart
I'm going to see where he is
I love the sequence
when his arm gets ripped off
He's with the weird kid
looking at comics in our flat
Very romantic
Oh no we've moved on from all
the cheap innuendo about his sexuality
Go on carry on I'm listening now
What is the plan
Oh shit
It's all right
I can handle this
I done a BTEC in computer science
 What are you doing
 I'm trying to turn off the alarm
Oh that's a shame
That's a shame it's broken
Is that what they taught you
on your BTEC in computer science
 I never said I passed it
 Get out the way
 You're a fucking rocket scientist
 Yes I fucking am
This guy really needs
to get out more
Try some internet dating
or a salsa class
I've heard they're
We're not here to sort out
his social life are we
I told you
whatever he draws
it actually happens
Rip them up Maybe that'll stop it
Are you OK
I'm fine
I'll see you later
Alisha
I split up with you
Why would I do that
What was I thinking
Look at you
I want you back
Let's get back together
Can we do that
Don't say no Please don't say no
It was Peter's drawings
Whatever he drew it came true
He made you break up with me
I hurt you
It wasn't your fault
I'm so sorry
I know what you did
I was just trying to help you
How can you say that
You manipulated me
Alisha doesn't want you to be
who you need to become
She doesn't understand
I did it for both of you
You made me split up with her
I had to do it
You told me You told me
if you don't go back in time
she'll never fall in love with you
And if she doesn't
fall in love with you
Well you won't do
what you have to do
You know it better than I do
Maybe I was wrong
I thought I had to become him
to protect Alisha
All I did was hurt her
I know you can do it
You can save her
You're a superhero
It's your destiny
I'm not a superhero
They're a fantasy
R's your fantasy
not mine
I won't ever leave her
So which one of you is it today
I'm the goodlooking one
You're both equally fuck ugly
as far as I can see
Right I pity you mate
Your anger Your bitterness
Your hatred for all that is good
and pure in the world
Don't take this the wrong way or anything
but I think you might have been sexually
abused as a small child
What's up with you
A word of advice don't ever suggest
the probation worker
was sexually abused as a small child
He did not like that at all
Funny that
Looks like those two made up
Yeah you know
in many ways that is a real shame
cos I reckon I could've tapped that
Off the rebound You know what I mean
Nowt better than a teary fuck
Wouldn't do it Wouldn't do that
Thought never even crossed my mind
Noone is happier than me
that we are all back to normal
Ah
Alisha
Why are you doing this
What do you want
Please will you just let me go
Mmm Mmm
Mmm
Ah
Are you OK Did he hurt you
I'm fine
Why
Why did you do it
You did it
You You saved her
A superhero
has to be prepared to die
for what he believes in
Alisha
It's like watching you die
all over again
I don't want you to become him
I want you to stay here with me
You don't have to go back
Promise me you won't go back
Promise me
I promise
I don't want you to put that suit on
ever again
Burn it
With him
I did it
