1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,097
Last december,
Heroes gave us a look into the future.

2
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:19,007
But that was just
the beginning.

3
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:23,509
There were strangers whow
discovered extraordinary abilities.

4
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:25,143
I think I can fly.

5
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:27,584
Unti they realized
they were not alone.

6
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:28,938
We're all connected.

7
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:31,188
With the discovery
of one thing.

8
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:33,236
The list.

9
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,720
The invicible cheerleader

10
00:00:35,857 --> 00:00:37,870
on a mission to find
her birth parents.

11
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:39,371
I think I'm old enough for you

12
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:41,241
to tell me who my
real parents are.

13
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,490
The mother with an alterego

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,481
makes a sacrifice to
protect her child.

15
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:48,552
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- Yeah, you can arrest me.

16
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:50,222
Your mom is not coming home.

17
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:54,072
And tonight the search
for new heroes begins.

18
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:55,573
How can you see me?

19
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:58,283
This entire city is in danger.

20
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:01,203
It's me.

21
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:05,981
Heroes, the next
chapter begins now.

22
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:45,912
You get your mind
read yet, Niki?

23
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:53,930
Up to me, I'd leave you in
the box here a few more weeks.

24
00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:57,601
Even animals like you
get a lawyer visit.

25
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:00,992
You just move real slow-like,
you hear me?

26
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:05,421
Nice and easy.
Show me your hands!

27
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:10,983
Come on, get 'em up! Go on.

28
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:14,472
Let's go.

29
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:18,833
Union Wells High School
opens its doors today

30
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:21,521
for the first time since
16-year-old Jackie Wilcox

31
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:23,980
was brutally murdered
during a homecoming game

32
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,252
two weeks ago.

33
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,891
Teachers and students
wrestle with how to remember

34
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:31,293
the slain cheerleader,
while still trying to move on.

35
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:33,893
This is Angela Braumstead,
Channel 5 News.

36
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,741
Look at all those reporters.

37
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,851
You don't have to
worry about the press.

38
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,471
They're not allowed
on school grounds.

39
00:02:40,658 --> 00:02:42,263
I'm more worried
about the other kids.

40
00:02:42,357 --> 00:02:44,381
They're gonna want to ask
me questions about it.

41
00:02:44,806 --> 00:02:47,780
Well... You don't have
to tell them anything.

42
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:52,122
Well, good,
'cause I don't really remember much.

43
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:56,752
I know that's supposed to be
post-traumatic stress or whatever,

44
00:02:56,986 --> 00:03:00,770
but nothing? Nothing at all?

45
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:03,153
Memory's a funny thing. I think

46
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,372
it's a blessing that
you don't remember.

47
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:08,163
- Where'd you find me?
- What do you mean?

48
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:10,982
The night Jackie got killed.

49
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,453
You said you found
me by the stadium?

50
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:16,561
You were scared to death.
You were traumatized.

51
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:18,362
You just wanted to go home.

52
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,411
I don't remember.

53
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:22,530
Thanks.

54
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:26,052
I guess I better go.

55
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:49,252
Not so dangerous anymore,
are we, Mr. Sylar?

56
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:51,283
We've gone over
every strand of code,

57
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:55,352
trying to find the code on switches
that identify his aptitudes.

58
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:57,673
Other than telekinesis,
we're drawing a blank.

59
00:03:57,955 --> 00:04:00,121
Has he responded to
the glycimerine?

60
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:02,430
Given him enough to
kill an elephant.

61
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,650
Nothing. We're no closer.

62
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,611
If we keep up at this rate,
he'll be dead by tomorrow.

63
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:11,871
After what he did to Eden,
he'd deserve it.

64
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:14,660
Unfortunately, they
haven't authorized that.

65
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:16,503
He stays alive.

66
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,002
You're just gonna
have to dig deeper.

67
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:34,862
You better be right
about this, Parkman.

68
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:42,641
Go, go, go!
Come on, come on, let's go.

69
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:49,241
We swept this entire place.
There's nothing here but paper.

70
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:50,821
- Did you check the basement?
- Yeah!

71
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:52,870
- Stairwells?
- Mm-hmm. More paper.

72
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:54,852
Hey. Where is he?

73
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:57,760
Where is he? Where's Sylar?

74
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,161
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

75
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:09,823
He's not here, Parkman.

76
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:13,883
Nice going.

77
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,071
Oops.

78
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:33,020
The Tyrannosaurus Rex was a huge,
meat-eating dinosaur

79
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:35,430
that lived during the
late Cretaceous Period

80
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,701
about 65 to 85
million years ago.

81
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,542
Look out!

82
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,901
If we could go back in time,

83
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,263
there's no telling what
wonders we'd find...

84
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,001
I wish.

85
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:52,061
All the books I read
said the sword is here.

86
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:54,042
So what?
We finally make it to NewYork...

87
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:56,032
and all you care
about is a sword.

88
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:57,342
What about your mission?

89
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:59,662
I need my powers
for the mission!

90
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:03,240
But the bomb is going
off on November 8th.

91
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:05,033
We only have 3 more weeks.

92
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:07,682
I know but ever since
I lost Charlie...

93
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:09,952
my powers have gotten
weaker and weaker.

94
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:13,112
My sword will
restore my powers.

95
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:15,243
It's not your sword.

96
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,662
We found it!

97
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:03,733
He's burning up.

98
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:06,331
Persistent idiopathic fever.

99
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:08,413
Means  they have no
idea what's wrong.

100
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:11,670
Find the best doctors in the world,
just to have them tell me

101
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:14,332
they don't know what they're 
doing in four different languages.

102
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:16,771
His heart-- they don't know
how much more he can take.

103
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:19,043
26 years old,
he's gonna die of a heart attack?

104
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:22,263
- He's not gonna die, Ma.
- He will unless I do something.

105
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:24,790
Why don't you just let the
doctors do what they do?

106
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,513
I wish I knew what
was going on in there.

107
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:33,141
Just before he passed out,
he said he, uh...

108
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:36,980
He felt he was absorbing
too many powers.

109
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:39,660
Peter wanted to
see that painting.

110
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:41,811
After I told you not to let him,
you knew he was

111
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,861
gonna  follow that thing
headfirst all the way to Texas.

112
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:46,462
He's my brother and I love him,

113
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:48,920
but we both know he shouldn't
have even been there.

114
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:52,350
- It was important to him.
- You really believe all this crap?

115
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,842
Future paintings?

116
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:58,521
- The end of the world?
- I know he believes it.

117
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:01,101
And I believe in him.

118
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,371
Fine. Then show me.

119
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:07,170
I've been in this damn
hospital room for two weeks,

120
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:08,482
waiting for
something to happen.

121
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:11,263
I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit
around and watch my brother die.

122
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,773
Take me to the artist.

123
00:08:12,897 --> 00:08:14,780
I want to see what's
worth all this.

124
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:22,060
I love you, man.

125
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,622
There.

126
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:29,823
Okay, your first mistake?

127
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:32,650
Never put the peanut butter
in the refrigerator.

128
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:34,832
Mom always keeps it
at room temperature.

129
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:36,902
Well, your dad's
got his own style.

130
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:39,830
- I see that.
- It still tastes good.

131
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:41,700
Hey.

132
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:44,841
What happened to you?

133
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:47,291
Did you get in a
fight at school today?

134
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:49,792
It's nothing. Just some jerks.

135
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:51,253
Well, what happened?

136
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:53,562
Dad, they called
Mom a psycho killer.

137
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:58,352
I know,
you can lecture me about not fighting.

138
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,330
No. No, I...

139
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:07,080
I know how hard it
is without her.

140
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:09,761
And I wish it could be easier.

141
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:12,312
But we gonna make it.

142
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:21,522
You enjoy that. I'll be back.

143
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,870
I believe you were
expecting me?

144
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,901
The name is Malski.
Aaron Malski.

145
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:35,881
I take it you have it here?

146
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:52,390
Have the charges
against me been dropped?

147
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:54,663
Your wife's confession
took care of most of that.

148
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:57,642
Her pointing out where to
find the bodies helped too.

149
00:09:57,788 --> 00:09:59,151
As for the other charges,

150
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:02,223
consider yourself a free man,
Mr. Hawkins.

151
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:03,873
So no more looking
over my shoulder?

152
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:06,050
Only if you wish to
see where you've been.

153
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:11,881
So that's it.

154
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:14,472
Linderman leaves me
and my family alone?

155
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:17,071
Oh, I wouldn't
bank on that, no.

156
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:19,912
That was the deal.
You got back your $2 million.

157
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:21,842
There is no deal, Mr. Hawkins,

158
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:24,493
unless Mr.
Linderman says there's a deal.

159
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,520
You  took something of his.

160
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:30,163
And he reserves the right to
let you make that up to him.

161
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,190
Believe me.

162
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,170
You'll be the first to find out

163
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:35,581
when he chooses to
call in that debt.

164
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,612
You have a nice day now.

165
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:45,511
Takezo Kensai.

166
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:49,382
My father used to tell me
stories about him before bed.

167
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:53,941
He was a wild savage
with great power.

168
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:56,860
All of Japan feared him.

169
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,651
Until one day he found...

170
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:02,641
a sacred sword
frozen in the snow.

171
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:05,670
From the moment
Kensai held it...

172
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:08,081
it focused all his strength.

173
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:11,061
He said the sword let
him control his power.

174
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,761
And so he became
a great leader.

175
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:14,841
A hero.

176
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:23,572
That symbol here.

177
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,373
It's a combination
of characters.

178
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:29,491
"Great talent"...

179
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,591
"Godsend".

180
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:36,083
"Great talent"... "Godsend".

181
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:37,312
Like your power.

182
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:38,050
See?

183
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:40,540
I'm like him.

184
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,752
The sword will give me...

185
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:45,301
the control over
my power I need.

186
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:47,333
It's my sacred object.

187
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:51,032
With it my powers will return
and I can fulfill my destiny.

188
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:53,570
What exactly are you saying?

189
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:58,651
I'm saying we take it.

190
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:00,902
We?

191
00:12:07,617 --> 00:12:09,313
I'm glad the Bureau
finally decided

192
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:11,073
to take the list I
offered seriously.

193
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,081
Too many people showing
up dead or missing.

194
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:15,863
If you didn't have a record
showing you were in India

195
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:17,430
when some of these
people were killed,

196
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,981
you and I would be having a
very different conversation.

197
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,150
- How fortunate for me, then.
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:25,652
You say, uh...
your father compiled this list?

199
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:27,582
Yes, he was a geneticist.

200
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:30,230
All the people on the list
share a unique genetic marker

201
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:33,401
that he was able to map and track
using the Human Genome Project.

202
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:34,760
Uh-huh.

203
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:37,980
I've been trying to locate them.
To warn them?

204
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:42,193
- About this man Sylar?
- Yes, the man who killed my father.

205
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,471
I see. Well, we ran the name.

206
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:52,670
Nothing. Clearly an alias.

207
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,970
But we did follow up on

208
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,670
another name you said
was on the list.

209
00:12:57,996 --> 00:12:59,462
Sarah Ellis?

210
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,682
Yes, I tried to locate
her in Los Angeles,

211
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:03,691
but she wasn't at any
of her known addresses,

212
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,862
and no,
I've never met her before.

213
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:07,511
Are you sure?

214
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,940
That's Sarah Ellis?

215
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:18,941
I know her by a different name.

216
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:20,442
Eden McCain.

217
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:23,231
She, uh--
lives across the hall right there.

218
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,860
She's been gone for a few weeks.
Is there a problem?

219
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,180
She turned up three days ago.

220
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:32,041
Well... what was
left of her, anyway.

221
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:32,933
What?

222
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:35,863
Yeah, they pulled her out
of Lake Ramsey in Sudbury.

223
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:38,370
Hundred miles out of Ontario.

224
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:41,013
Gunshot wound to the head.

225
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,473
Local law wrote it
up as a suicide.

226
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:54,132
The, uh...
last I heard from her,

227
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:56,751
she said she had something
to confess to me.

228
00:13:57,365 --> 00:14:00,532
- You say she was your friend?
- She--

229
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:04,773
I don't know what she was.

230
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:15,033
The guy who you were
just talking to

231
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,303
- has Sylar in this building.
- No, Parkman.

232
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:18,760
- Yes, he-- 
- He doesn't.

233
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:21,661
- There's nothing in here but paper.
- But we didn't look everywhere.

234
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:26,201
Maybe-- there's a secret room.
Somewhere. Okay? Maybe--

235
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:29,803
And maybe I can whistle The
Star-Spangled Banner out of my ass.

236
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:32,831
We are lucky he hasn't threatened
to sue us for this stunt.

237
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,282
You want to know what's on
this tape he just handed me?

238
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:37,251
You.

239
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,280
Caught on the parking
lot surveillance camera.

240
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,313
What, you didn't think
anyone would notice

241
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:44,391
a  guy sitting in the same
car every day for two weeks?

242
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:46,690
Do you have any idea

243
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,862
the position you have
put this Bureau in?

244
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:51,083
- I was following a hunch.
- Whose hunch?

245
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:54,022
My hunch? The Bureau's hunch?

246
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,053
- Matt's hunch.
- He abducted people.

247
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:58,742
He abducted me!
He abducted Ted Sprague!

248
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:00,920
Sure, the guy with
the radioactive hands?

249
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,091
Well, it all makes
perfect sense.

250
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:07,020
I am going to make sure
you are benched for this.

251
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,822
- What, that's it?
- Obviously.

252
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:17,662
We both know he's in here.
I know--

253
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:20,261
Do we?
Because all I know is that I have wasted

254
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:22,483
the last three weeks of
my life on the crazy idea

255
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:24,273
that you can hear
people's thoughts.

256
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:27,302
I liked you, Matt.
I felt sorry for you.

257
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:29,330
And maybe that
clouded my judgment.

258
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,080
But now I need to
get back to reality.

259
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:32,972
And you should do the same.

260
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:36,592
Go home, Matt. We're done.

261
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:43,680
Hey.

262
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:46,323
Hey-- listen to me.

263
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:50,440
I have no idea how you're pulling
this off, but I swear to God

264
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:52,973
I'm not gonna stop until I figure
it out, you understand me?

265
00:15:53,738 --> 00:15:55,100
Good luck with that.

266
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:11,033
- Zach.
- Hey, this is a public place.

267
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:13,103
Are you sure you can
be seen here with me?

268
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:14,092
Why not?

269
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:17,391
Right, I forgot.
You've been body-snatched.

270
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:19,093
Look,  I just want to talk.

271
00:16:20,908 --> 00:16:22,182
Hey, I'm sorry about Jackie.

272
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,200
I know she was your
best friend and all.

273
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:29,561
No, I actually discovered that
someone else was my best friend.

274
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,013
But I lost him too.

275
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:35,460
What happened to
you at Homecoming?

276
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:42,281
I can't remember.
Can't remember a lot of things lately.

277
00:16:43,077 --> 00:16:44,723
Yeah, it's, uh...

278
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,531
That's funny, 'cause lately,
I can't remember...

279
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:51,962
Must be something in
the water, right?

280
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:53,463
Zach, look at me.

281
00:16:56,168 --> 00:16:58,621
Do you feel like we
could be friends?

282
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,801
Us?

283
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:01,632
No.

284
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:06,013
We wouldn't play well together.

285
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:11,673
I gotta tell you, Ms. Sanders,

286
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,422
the outbursts are not helping.

287
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,003
Kind of getting
tired of them myself.

288
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:19,943
Look, I just want to
do my time in peace.

289
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:22,290
Yeah, about that.

290
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:26,171
It seems the D.A. is going to
file for special circumstances

291
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:31,250
in the homicides.
They're gonna seek the death penalty.

292
00:17:34,147 --> 00:17:37,410
- Death penalty?
- Look, I know it's a long shot.

293
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:40,533
But it might help if
you cooperated a little.

294
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,850
And how am I
supposed to do that?

295
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:45,592
The $2 million.
Things might go a little smoother

296
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:47,671
if you tell the
police where it is.

297
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:52,840
I've told you.
I don't know anything about that.

298
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:58,832
Who are you trying to fool?

299
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:01,202
You know exactly where it is.

300
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:03,530
I'm sorry?

301
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,821
He's right, Niki.
We should tell them.

302
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:09,431
Stop it!

303
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,493
Don't pay any attention to her.

304
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,183
Pay attention to who?

305
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:19,783
God, who am I gonna have to
screw to get out of this place?

306
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:21,201
I said stop it!

307
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,563
What is this?

308
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:27,012
What's it look like, dipstick?

309
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:29,843
Wait, you're going psych on me?

310
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:31,971
If that's what it takes.

311
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:34,953
Multiple personality disorders
are a real hard sell.

312
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:40,972
When I want your opinion,
I will ask for it.

313
00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:44,241
Just get us a damn shrink.

314
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:50,683
I'm not crazy.
No, I'm not crazy.

315
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,472
Don't listen to her.

316
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:54,983
Please, I'm telling
you the truth.

317
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:56,132
Of course you are.

318
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,170
No, don't listen to her.
Listen to me, please.

319
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,922
- I'm not lying to you.
- Of course you're not.

320
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:01,413
I'm telling you
the truth! Don't--

321
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:19,600
Which way to gift store?

322
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:24,540
Thank you. 

323
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,110
There's security everywhere.

324
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:36,160
Stealing isn't exactly part
of Bushido code, you know.

325
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,711
It's one antique.

326
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:41,123
If I don't have my powers...

327
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:44,031
this whole museum
will explode anyway.

328
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,962
It's a good deal for them.

329
00:19:56,356 --> 00:19:57,251
What happened?

330
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,702
Did  you get it?

331
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:00,971
No. My power. It's not working.

332
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,191
Maybe you need the sword
to steal the sword.

333
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:32,371
Good enough.

334
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:20,001
Hiro?

335
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:23,691
Hiro?

336
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,592
That was amazing!

337
00:21:32,477 --> 00:21:33,980
You did it, Hiro!

338
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:37,373
Never doubt me again.

339
00:21:37,745 --> 00:21:39,302
With this sword...

340
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,430
there's no limit to
what I can accomplish.

341
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:43,602
Our life of legend begins.

342
00:21:51,016 --> 00:21:52,380
It's a fake!

343
00:21:57,785 --> 00:21:59,202
Linderman?

344
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:03,873
I'm gonna take it back.

345
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:11,573
Isaac was obsessed, ranting about
a bomb coming to explode New York.

346
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:13,182
The painting on the floor.

347
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,633
Yeah, and he just left.

348
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,902
Someone came and
took his paintings.

349
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,690
And I don't understand.
He's been gone a few weeks.

350
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:21,572
Then I came back.

351
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:27,452
Isaac.

352
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:33,253
I'm waiting for
the shock to clear

353
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:36,421
so I can tell if
you're glad to see me.

354
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:41,123
Well... I'm just
going to, uh...

355
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:45,832
You look...

356
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:48,933
you look healthy.

357
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:51,751
I got back a few days ago.

358
00:22:51,948 --> 00:22:54,073
I wasn't sure when to call you.

359
00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:58,520
I was in a clinic.

360
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:00,440
I...

361
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:03,031
I barely remember
any of it, but

362
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:08,051
when I woke up, I was in Texas.
And I was clean.

363
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:13,253
- That's great.
- I mean it.

364
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:17,413
I don't need the drugs anymore,
I can paint without it.

365
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,283
Well, I'm glad for you.

366
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,791
I'm only alive because
of you, Simone.

367
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:27,902
I still love you.

368
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:31,661
All right, uh, this painting...

369
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:36,002
That's like he's exploding.
Like he's a bomb.

370
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:39,250
How did you know about this?

371
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:40,993
Did you talk to
my brother Peter?

372
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:42,832
I painted what I saw.

373
00:23:44,187 --> 00:23:46,890
The last thing Peter said
before he collapsed was that he

374
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:49,720
was the cause of the explosion.

375
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,490
Look, I may not get everything.
That's fine, but this...

376
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:57,041
I mean,
these things can't be connected.

377
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,873
And the world doesn't
work like this.

378
00:24:01,368 --> 00:24:05,252
Mr. Isaac. Bad news, sword not there.
It was replica.

379
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,130
Original owned by
man named Linderman.

380
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:10,021
Did he say Linderman?

381
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:13,770
Flying Man!

382
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:24,812
Save the cheerleader,
save the world.

383
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:29,042
What does that even mean?

384
00:24:29,975 --> 00:24:33,582
Have I been saved,
or do I still need saving?

385
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:36,081
You're saved for
the time being.

386
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,481
I wanna talk to Peter Petrelli.

387
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:43,671
You're not supposed to
remember Peter Petrelli.

388
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:45,033
He's being watched.

389
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:47,493
If you try to contact him,
your father will know.

390
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:52,001
You have to give me something.

391
00:24:53,686 --> 00:24:56,813
Nothing in my life
has been real.

392
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:01,191
My dad obviously doesn't
work in a paper factory.

393
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:03,733
I don't know what he does.

394
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:06,743
And what about my
biological parents?

395
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:10,293
He didn't find them through
the adoption agency, did he?

396
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:13,460
They work for your father.
Like I do.

397
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:16,151
Everything has been a lie.

398
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:21,111
The only person I could trust was Zach,
and you took him from me.

399
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:24,001
That was your father's doing.
Not mine.

400
00:25:24,185 --> 00:25:25,932
Then give him back
his memories.

401
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:29,842
I don't wanna be alone.

402
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:35,312
You are not alone, Claire.

403
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:38,861
And I cannot give your
friend back his memories.

404
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:40,940
It's not how my gift works.

405
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:43,060
Your gift?

406
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:44,951
Is that what you call it?

407
00:25:45,188 --> 00:25:46,970
What do you call it?

408
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:49,901
My own private freak show.

409
00:25:53,355 --> 00:25:55,031
What you can do,

410
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,663
what I can do,

411
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:00,530
that is God.

412
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:03,923
Respect it accordingly.

413
00:26:17,486 --> 00:26:19,511
The bomb,
it comes from the street.

414
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,450
Destroy everything,
everything turn into dust. Poof!

415
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:24,720
Your English is a lot better.

416
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:27,602
- I met a waitress in Texas.
- Oh, yeah?

417
00:26:27,797 --> 00:26:31,393
- She teach me many things.
- Good for you.

418
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:35,971
So, uh, look, I can't believe
I'm about to say this, you...

419
00:26:36,906 --> 00:26:39,081
teleported here...

420
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:41,430
back from the future.

421
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:45,360
Yes, my power let me come
back here so I can stop it.

422
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:46,590
Right.

423
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:49,712
- Because "you hero."
- You will help too.

424
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:54,521
Me? What makes you so sure?

425
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,790
You're flying man. Whoosh!

426
00:26:57,306 --> 00:27:00,720
- Would you keep it down?
- Whoosh.

427
00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:05,670
What do you think it is that
makes this bomb thing go off?

428
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:08,742
Don't know... probably bad guy?

429
00:27:08,937 --> 00:27:10,110
- Bad guy?
- Yes.

430
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:11,450
- Like villain.
- What's that?

431
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:12,890
- Villain.
- Villain?

432
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:14,351
- Villain.
- Villain.

433
00:27:14,536 --> 00:27:17,091
- Vee.
- Vee-yun.

434
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,121
Like the guy in the painting?

435
00:27:24,536 --> 00:27:27,513
You think a human being can
actually cause an explosion?

436
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:31,262
I have power, you have power.

437
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,803
- Maybe he has power too.
- Bad guy.

438
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:38,741
- We must stop him.
- I think I can help.

439
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:48,300
Somewhere in the Nevada desert.

440
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:25,793
We've been here before.
You, me, the video camera.

441
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:28,662
Is it at all familiar?

442
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:32,173
What are you doing, auditioning
for America's Next Top Model?

443
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:35,163
You made that joke
the first time.

444
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:39,050
Look, just keep the
camera on me, okay?

445
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:42,513
- Why don't you just use a tripod?
- I can't do this by myself.

446
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,680
And I know you can keep a secret,
you did.

447
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:49,710
You did,
until you forgot what it was.

448
00:28:50,975 --> 00:28:52,671
When we were best friends.

449
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:54,781
You ready?

450
00:28:55,206 --> 00:28:58,232
Claire, hold on a second.
I'm sure you told me this...

451
00:28:58,425 --> 00:29:04,502
before, but, um, why are we
videotaping this? Whatever this is.

452
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:07,621
Actually, I didn't
tell you that before.

453
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:10,801
The first time I did this,
I did it to show my parents.

454
00:29:10,985 --> 00:29:14,870
My real parents.
I wanted them to see what I was.

455
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:19,260
I thought they could
help me understand.

456
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:22,382
But I don't think I'm
ever gonna meet them.

457
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:24,512
They may not even
be alive anymore.

458
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:27,681
- So why do you wanna tape it now?
- For me.

459
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,150
So I never forget what I am.

460
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:35,611
No matter what happens to me.

461
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:39,650
Look, just don't
freak out, okay?

462
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:43,710
- I won't.
- You said that last time.

463
00:29:50,007 --> 00:29:52,091
Camera's ready for whatever.

464
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,941
Okay, I'm ready.
Keep the camera on me.

465
00:29:57,035 --> 00:29:58,492
What are you doing?

466
00:29:59,007 --> 00:29:59,953
Aah!

467
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,862
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God-- Claire!

468
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:27,742
This is Claire Bennett.
And as far as you know,

469
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:30,582
that was attempt number one.

470
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,620
I don't know how much
longer I'm gonna be here.

471
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:45,273
And what's that
supposed to mean?

472
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:48,383
They're sending me
to the psych ward.

473
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:51,403
For an evaluation
with a shrink.

474
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:55,882
She's here. Jessica.

475
00:30:56,435 --> 00:30:57,990
She came out, she

476
00:30:58,136 --> 00:31:00,690
tried to escape,
she hurt one of the guards.

477
00:31:00,797 --> 00:31:02,603
Well, maybe a shrink can
help you deal with her.

478
00:31:02,637 --> 00:31:05,471
- Get rid of her.
- This isn't in my head, D.L.

479
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:07,501
She is real.

480
00:31:07,695 --> 00:31:09,681
I should've never
let you do this, Nik,

481
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,323
get yourself thrown in here.

482
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:21,302
I shoulda kept that
money to help you out.

483
00:31:21,487 --> 00:31:26,372
No. You had to give it back,
or else this would never be over.

484
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,362
Let me talk to Micah.

485
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:45,611
I want you to come home.

486
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:48,861
I know, sweetie. But I can't.

487
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:54,093
It's hard to
understand right now.

488
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:58,460
But I hope that
one day you will.

489
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,280
Your daddy,

490
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:04,930
he's gonna take real good
care of you while I'm gone.

491
00:32:12,617 --> 00:32:17,080
I need you to be the strong one
because I'm not strong right now, okay?

492
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:20,140
Mom, that's not fair.

493
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,340
That's my son.
Can I just give him a hug?

494
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:30,391
Just for a second, I promise.

495
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:32,411
Baby, it's all right.
It's all right.

496
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:34,391
No, he needs me.

497
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:39,171
He needs me.
Just let me hold him.

498
00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:40,733
- Stay right there.
- He needs me.

499
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,951
- I said stay there!
- Please.

500
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:46,601
- I'm warning you.
- Please. Just for a moment.

501
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,300
Mom!

502
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:56,483
I just wanted to see my son.

503
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:16,800
I don't even know
what she fed you.

504
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:22,563
They eat crickets.
Lots of crickets.

505
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:24,881
You.

506
00:33:25,496 --> 00:33:27,463
Hope you don't mind,
I let myself in.

507
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,082
Have you come to kill me now?

508
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,492
That depends.

509
00:33:33,518 --> 00:33:36,741
I'd like to talk
to you about Eden.

510
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:39,880
- She worked for me.
- Don't you mean Sarah Ellis?

511
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,512
She gave up that name and
that life a long time ago.

512
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:44,102
And she was a good person.

513
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:47,021
Yes, of course, all spies are very
good people. Just misunderstood.

514
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,412
She cared about you more
than she should've.

515
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,893
She was... special.

516
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:55,193
She had an ability?
What was it?

517
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:57,731
Suffice it to say,
she learned how to use it wisely.

518
00:33:58,195 --> 00:34:01,061
Not everyone who has these
abilities deserves them.

519
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:03,651
And who are you to judge?
In fact, who are you, period?

520
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:05,003
I made a mistake.

521
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:08,102
And I should've come to
you a long time ago.

522
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:09,621
You've been spying
on me for weeks.

523
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:11,833
In India, my cab,
bugging my phone.

524
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:14,602
We need to help each other,
Dr. Suresh.

525
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:16,623
And why would I help you?

526
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:22,571
You need me, don't you?

527
00:34:23,315 --> 00:34:25,100
My father,
he knew more than you do.

528
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:26,882
From what we could
observe, yes.

529
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:28,263
Well, if you've been watching,

530
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:29,881
then you know my father's
formula doesn't work.

531
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,840
We both know that he
generated a list.

532
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,522
Who's on that list is a
matter of grave importance.

533
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:36,823
You've come for it?
You want to find them?

534
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:41,152
Why do you seem so worried?
Are you on the list?

535
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:44,210
You've no doubt realized
things can go terribly wrong

536
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,023
with these abilities. If you work
with me, we can control that.

537
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:50,412
If and when I do
figure out this list,

538
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:53,470
the first thing I'm going
to do is warn these people.

539
00:34:53,616 --> 00:34:55,630
About you.

540
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:58,312
Together, we could actually
make a difference.

541
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,562
Sorry, not interested.

542
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:15,730
Contact me when you
change your mind.

543
00:35:19,438 --> 00:35:21,530
The access number's
on the back.

544
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:46,281
Are you back?

545
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:48,832
Yeah.

546
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,940
I took out that
suitcase this morning.

547
00:35:54,556 --> 00:35:56,520
But I haven't packed it yet.

548
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:13,072
Um, I know that
we're in trouble.

549
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:15,793
And I know that a
lot of it is my--

550
00:36:15,976 --> 00:36:17,990
most of it is my fault.

551
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:21,522
Janice, we need to start being
completely honest with each other,

552
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,870
- come clean about everything.
- Okay.

553
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:25,563
'Cause there's something
I gotta tell you.

554
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:27,550
Something has happened to me.
Something that's...

555
00:36:27,657 --> 00:36:32,753
- really hard to explain.
- Just say it.

556
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:35,490
I can hear people's thoughts.

557
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:38,280
Meaning what?

558
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:44,282
I hear their thoughts.
What they're thinking.

559
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:46,061
It started a few weeks ago.

560
00:36:46,158 --> 00:36:48,072
That's why I've been with
the FBI all this time.

561
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,483
What? What do you mean?

562
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:55,040
- Like, a psychic or something?
- I don't know. I guess.

563
00:36:56,568 --> 00:36:58,762
- You can't be serious.
- Yeah.

564
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:03,923
You don't believe me.
Okay, that's all right.

565
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:06,030
Here, come here. Come here.

566
00:37:06,737 --> 00:37:09,502
Um... All right.

567
00:37:11,756 --> 00:37:15,853
Pick a number between one...
and a million.

568
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:21,203
- Come on, bring it on.
- Uh...

569
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:27,881
I took his power, Nathan.

570
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:31,441
- I can't control it.
- Let me help you, Peter.

571
00:38:32,648 --> 00:38:34,050
You can't.

572
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,881
I'm not leaving you.

573
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:39,770
No!

574
00:38:43,335 --> 00:38:45,193
Aah!

575
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:57,893
Aah! Aah! Aah!

576
00:39:05,616 --> 00:39:06,691
Ma?

577
00:39:07,565 --> 00:39:08,501
Where is he?

578
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,330
I have no idea. He woke up.

579
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,342
- He woke up?
- Yes. He was raving.

580
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:15,790
After two weeks spent
sitting at his bedside,

581
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:19,413
thinking he could die,
he says he's gotta get away.

582
00:39:19,645 --> 00:39:22,111
- You just let him leave?
- No, I just did not let him leave.

583
00:39:22,355 --> 00:39:23,870
And when I see him,
I will kill him.

584
00:39:24,388 --> 00:39:27,583
Mom... all right, look.
Just go home, okay?

585
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:31,422
Get some rest.
I'll take care of it.

586
00:39:32,445 --> 00:39:36,391
You're really Hiro Nakamura
-from Isaac's comic book?

587
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:39,871
Yes, I worked there,
at Yamagato,

588
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:45,151
and we fly here,
and we drive that car everywhere.

589
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:48,353
Blue Nissan Versa.
It's parked outside right now.

590
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:50,551
I'm just like Mr.
Isaac draw me,

591
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:53,131
except my face not so round.

592
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:57,591
Okay, yeah. I give up.

593
00:39:57,737 --> 00:39:59,891
The world is insane,
I'm not gonna keep fighting it.

594
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:04,411
You can paint the future!
And he needs a sword.

595
00:40:04,555 --> 00:40:06,473
This guy Linderman?
He's a client of mine.

596
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:07,882
Huge collector.

597
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:10,182
He buys every painting
of Isaac's he can.

598
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:11,862
I can get you in there.

599
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:14,111
Get your car,
you're going back to Vegas.

600
00:40:16,107 --> 00:40:19,873
Yeah, I need the first flight
out of New York into the desert.

601
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:23,952
Uh, I don't know.
Nevada, maybe?

602
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:28,642
That's where they did all those
nuclear bomb tests, right?

603
00:40:29,106 --> 00:40:30,033
Okay.

604
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:34,033
Uh, yeah, Las Vegas.
Las Vegas is good. Yeah, whatever.

605
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:39,873
Yeah, I'll hold.

606
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:56,851
Hey!

607
00:40:58,017 --> 00:40:58,852
Hey!

608
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:01,721
Hey!

609
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:05,481
What are you do-- hey!

610
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:10,181
- You can see me.
- You--

611
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:15,261
Nobody sees me! Do you hear me?

612
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:19,620
Nobody sees me! I'm invisible!

613
00:41:26,696 --> 00:41:29,192
In the beginning,
there was discovery.

614
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,463
A confusion of elements,

615
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:36,432
the first snowfall of
impossible change.

616
00:41:37,688 --> 00:41:41,121
Old lives undone, left behind.

617
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,680
Strange faces made familiar...

618
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:51,530
new nightmares to
challenge sleep.

619
00:41:55,418 --> 00:41:58,422
New friends to feel safe with.

620
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:01,383
Only then comes control.

621
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:04,720
The need to impose
order onto chaos,

622
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:08,391
through determination,
through study, through struggle...

623
00:42:08,668 --> 00:42:10,121
She's gonna be okay.

624
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:12,363
You know that, right?

625
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:17,593
You'd tell me the truth, right?

626
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:21,023
All in defiance of
a thundering truth.

627
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:25,823
They're here.
And the earth shudders underfoot.

628
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:27,311
Oh, God...

629
00:42:28,335 --> 00:42:29,363
Lights out.

630
00:42:29,545 --> 00:42:31,182
Please help me.

631
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:38,953
Who needs God when
you've got me?

632
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:45,932
