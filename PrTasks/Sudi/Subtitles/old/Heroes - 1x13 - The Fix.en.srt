1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:02,044
Previously on Heroes...

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:05,964
Camera's ready for whatever.

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,424
What are you doing?

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,260
Oh, my God.

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,888
When we embrace
what lies within

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,224
our potential has no limit.

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,143
As far as you know,
that was attempt number one.

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,270
The future is filled
with promise.

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,774
- The present, rife with expectation.
- Whoosh!

10
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,400
But when we deny
our instinct...

11
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:29,821
and struggle against
our deepest urges...

12
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,901
- Are you on the list?
- Uncertainty begins.

13
00:00:33,153 --> 00:00:35,660
My dad obviously doesn't
work in a paper factory.

14
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,371
I don't know what he does.

15
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,252
Where is he? Where's Sylar?

16
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:43,872
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Oh!

17
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,001
Where does this path lead?

18
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:48,841
I have no idea how you're pulling
this off but I swear to God,

19
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:50,892
I'm not gonna stop until I figure
it out. You understand me?

20
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,761
When will the changes end?

21
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:55,591
- Is this transformation a gift?
- I just wanna see my son!

22
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:58,261
- Or a curse?
- You don't anything about power.

23
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:02,433
And for those who fear
what lies ahead...

24
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:05,522
- I can't control it.
- Let me help you, Peter.

25
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:08,272
The most important
question of all...

26
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:11,071
Can we ever really
change what we are?

27
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:13,281
Aahh!

28
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:19,322
Hey!

29
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:21,201
Hey!

30
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:24,661
What are...

31
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,250
What are you doing? Hey!

32
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,750
You...

33
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:32,090
- You can see me?
- You...

34
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:34,631
Nobody can see me!

35
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:36,300
I'm invisisible!

36
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:40,140
Who are you?

37
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:41,683
How can you see me?

38
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:43,892
I don't know,
I can just do what you can do.

39
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,142
Fantastic.

40
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:49,903
- One of those.
- One of those?

41
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:52,483
What do you mean,
you know someone else like me?

42
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:55,220
Hey wait, where are you going?
You need to explain this.

43
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:56,532
Look... I saw you.

44
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:58,532
I saw you in my dream.
Who are you?

45
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,242
Me? I'm no one.

46
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,133
I'm the Invisible Man.
I'm Claude Rains.

47
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:04,043
Now get away from me.
Forget you ever saw me.

48
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:05,542
Yeah, but you know.

49
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,041
What's happening to me?

50
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:08,920
What is this? What...

51
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,543
Listen, I found you.
I need you to help me.

52
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,960
- Why'd I want to do that?
- Because we're in danger.

53
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,263
This entire city is in danger.

54
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:18,300
It was in my dream.

55
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,680
People die. We die.

56
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,643
I don't know when,
but it happens.

57
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:26,232
Then you'd better leave town.

58
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:28,440
Hey, where are you going?
You can't hide from me.

59
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,560
I'm the Invisible Man.

60
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:32,021
I could walk around the
corner and disappear forever.

61
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,192
Yeah, but... but I can see you.
I'm gonna follow you.

62
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:36,520
Smarter men than you have
tried and have paid for it.

63
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:38,362
Stay away from me.

64
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:41,571
And don't follow me.

65
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:57,761
Chapter 13 - The Fix

66
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,532
Um...

67
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:27,452
Red elephant with blue stripes?

68
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,912
Pin stripe or plaid?

69
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:34,710
Honey, I can't see your thoughts.
I can only hear 'em.

70
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:36,461
Huh.

71
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:39,091
Oh, I have a good one.

72
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:43,180
Wait, the ratty curtains
in our old apartment?

73
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:46,512
Ugh! How do you do that?

74
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:04,660
I'm not sure what's happening.

75
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:07,370
His vitals are
extremely irregular.

76
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,750
After all we've done to him,
I'm not surprised.

77
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,041
Keep him stabilized.

78
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:12,712
There is another option.

79
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:16,593
Our instructions are to keep him alive.
Do whatever it takes.

80
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,341
If he crashes,

81
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,341
you bring him back.

82
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,431
Again and again.

83
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:29,062
When he dies it'll be on my terms,
not on his.

84
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:30,971
Clear?

85
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,442
But I'm only two minutes over.

86
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:43,321
- That'll be 48.50.
- For one-day parking?

87
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:45,860
Hey, you want your
car back or not?

88
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,303
Darn.

89
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:13,982
My power is lost
until I get the sword.

90
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,731
I focused the samurai
Kensei's power.

91
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:19,821
It will do the same for me.

92
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:22,152
But Hiro, if you have no power,

93
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:23,533
how can we steal the sword?

94
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:24,820
I will find a way.

95
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,740
That sword is my destiny.

96
00:05:26,746 --> 00:05:29,162
A samurai's weapon must
be used with honor.

97
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,913
And respect.

98
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:33,001
This sword has many
lessons to teach.

99
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:34,713
Swords  are for killing.

100
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:36,213
That's why they're sharp.

101
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:38,671
Maybe I use the sword
to kill bomb-man.

102
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,252
Is it my destiny
to kill this man?

103
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:44,553
- Hiro, wait!
- What is it?

104
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:47,972
That man, waiting by our car...

105
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:51,391
He doesn't look very friendly.

106
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:53,851
He has a gun.

107
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:55,683
Do something!

108
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,641
I have no power!

109
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,321
Help, there's a man chasing us!

110
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:08,202
Uh-oh.

111
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:33,800
Dr.  Suresh?

112
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:38,051
- Do you remember me?
- Nathan Petrelli.

113
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:40,062
You yelled at my car.

114
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:42,682
Yes, we met under
unfortunate circumstances.

115
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,892
I believe I came off
as a deranged lunatic.

116
00:06:45,146 --> 00:06:46,652
You mind if I come in?

117
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:51,782
I'm looking for my
brother, Doctor.

118
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,452
- That makes two of us.
- I'm sorry?

119
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,361
I've been leaving messages
for him for two days now.

120
00:06:57,616 --> 00:06:59,532
Guess I'm at the
wrong place then.

121
00:06:59,706 --> 00:07:00,741
I need to find him.

122
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,831
- The last time I heard, he was in Texas.
- He made it home barely.

123
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:06,041
Barely alive,
and now he's run off again.

124
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:07,961
Afraid that he's
gonna somehow...

125
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:10,132
hurt people.

126
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:16,880
Doctor, I, uh...
possibly you could explain to me.

127
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,053
What the hell's
happening to him?

128
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,061
Before his death,
my father compiled a list.

129
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:27,603
36 individuals who carry a genetic
marker which he discovered.

130
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:31,863
A marker which he theorized gave
these people certain abilities.

131
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:34,782
- And my brother's one of them?
- As are you.

132
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,993
- I didn't come here to talk about me.
- Fair enough.

133
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,413
Peter's specific DNA
allows for a blend.

134
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,211
Like colors in a mosaic.

135
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:49,100
Resequencing itself to mimic the
abilities of those around him.

136
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,213
- Like a chameleon?
- More like a sponge.

137
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:53,423
It's precisely why I've
been studying him.

138
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:56,801
Could his condition become dangerous
to himself or to other people?

139
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,012
If he absorbs too much,
or comes into contact

140
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:01,801
with an unstable ability,
then most definitely yes.

141
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:03,932
Can you fix it?

142
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:07,100
Alter his genes somehow?

143
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:10,770
Theoretically, it is possible to
develop a specific site inhibitor.

144
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,821
- But look, I will know more when we find him.
- We?

145
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,821
Doctor, the last
thing my brother needs

146
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,910
is somebody feeding
into his paranoia.

147
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,621
But thank you.

148
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:24,912
Mr. Petrelli.

149
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,543
Of all the people on that list

150
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:30,672
your brother may be
the most important.

151
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,420
If I can find him, study him,

152
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:35,842
then I can do more
than help him.

153
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,220
I can help all of you.

154
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,603
Now, give me a minute,
and I'll get my coat.

155
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,812
- I told you not to follow me.
- I need help.

156
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:55,521
You live up here?

157
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:58,652
You're not a fast learner,
eh, mate?

158
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:00,901
I took care of a man
who owned this building.

159
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:04,580
-  His name was Charles Deveaux.
- Never heard of him.

160
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:06,790
You don't think that's strange?

161
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,413
I worked here.

162
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,792
The place where you live
and keep your birds.

163
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,462
I don't keep anything.

164
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:14,670
I let 'em out once a day,
they come back.

165
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:17,003
Sounds like free will to me.

166
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:19,673
I need to learn how
to control this.

167
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,093
- Like you do.
- What are you talking about?

168
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:23,470
It can't be controlled.

169
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:24,853
There has to be some way.

170
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:26,642
If... if I don't,
New York explodes.

171
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:28,813
Okay? I explode.

172
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:31,983
An exploding man,
where'd you get that idea?

173
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,060
My dreams.

174
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:35,612
This place.

175
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:38,282
I found you for a reason.

176
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:42,152
I think you're the one that has
to teach me how to stop this.

177
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,031
There's no such thing.

178
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:45,452
No teaching.

179
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:47,160
No Sunday school
for the special.

180
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,792
What I can do, you can't learn.

181
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:50,951
You wake up in the morning,
it's there.

182
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:53,292
If you've got thin soup,
then that's your supper.

183
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:55,293
Sorry, mate,
that's the way it is.

184
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:57,290
I'm trying not to die.

185
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:59,462
There's got to be
something you can do.

186
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:01,303
I can kill you
myself right now.

187
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:03,223
Solve your exploding
problem here.

188
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:05,433
Maybe that's why you dreamt me.

189
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:08,313
Don't bother looking for me.

190
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:10,140
You won't find me here again.

191
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:23,070
So what exactly am
I looking for here?

192
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:25,572
Anything my dad doesn't
want us to find.

193
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,662
You said you're good
with computers.

194
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:30,201
I make movies on my laptop.

195
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:33,253
No, you're good at
finding those holes

196
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:36,831
in the internet password
protected nanny blocker stuff.

197
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:39,312
Shouldn't you be watching the
doorway if your dad walks in?

198
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,422
He's at work.

199
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:43,631
It's just you, me,
and Mr. Muggles.

200
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:47,183
There's nothing.

201
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:50,393
- There's not even any porn.
- Gross.

202
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:52,561
I'm serious,
this thing is totally clean.

203
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:53,643
No.

204
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:55,983
My dad lied to me
about my entire life.

205
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:58,690
My biological parents.
My ability.

206
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:00,571
You can't just hide
things like that.

207
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,650
There's gotta be
something on there.

208
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:04,401
If your dad's the guy
you're describing,

209
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:07,492
I don't think he's gonna keep his
secrets on the family computer.

210
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,500
- Shut it down.
- Okay, okay.

211
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,591
I thought you were at work.

212
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,350
Forgot my cell.

213
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:32,182
Zachary.

214
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,182
What a nice surprise
to see you here.

215
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:36,640
Yeah, it's biology class.

216
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,773
We're lab partners now.

217
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:44,191
Yeah we were just doing some
research on the internet.

218
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,823
- We have a presentation on...
- The manatee.

219
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:49,411
Also known as the sea cow.

220
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:55,950
Do you mind if I talk to Claire
in private for a moment?

221
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:58,293
You can wait in my room.

222
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:02,922
It's upstairs.
Second door on the right.

223
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:10,340
- So. You and Zach?
- Ms. Gomez stuck us together.

224
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,812
Must be some social
experiment or something.

225
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:16,520
- Worst day ever.
- Claire.

226
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,561
- What?
- You two used to be friends.

227
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:23,983
You might find you
actually get along.

228
00:12:34,248 --> 00:12:35,662
Nice save.

229
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:37,833
Thanks.

230
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:40,211
So what now?

231
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:45,171
I need to talk to someone
who has some answers.

232
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:49,260
He said if I needed him,
I should hang these outside my window.

233
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:52,683
What the hell are
you talking about?

234
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,473
Okay, wait.

235
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,942
You're saying that the guy
with the glasses actually...

236
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,523
- abducted you?
- Yes.

237
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:08,783
- And he... he did this to you?
- Yeah.

238
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:12,363
Yeah, and I gotta figure
out how he did this.

239
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,912
And I'm gonna take him and
everybody with him down.

240
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:16,833
That Haitian guy, all of 'em.

241
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,372
Matt,  I... I'm sorry.

242
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:23,383
I've gotta say,
this is all a little nuts.

243
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:26,553
I mean,
first the whole psychic thing.

244
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:28,130
And now...

245
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:31,133
Come on, you're telling me
you're about to run off

246
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,763
and chase some guy who works
in a paper factory in Texas.

247
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,602
They did this to me, Janice.
I need to find them.

248
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:39,022
I have to figure out
what this is all about.

249
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:43,020
- Maybe you could call the F.B.I.
- No, I can't.

250
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,612
I can't go to the F.B.I.
They think I'm crazy.

251
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:49,070
I... I gotta get ready.

252
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:51,112
I got a review
hearing this morning.

253
00:13:51,408 --> 00:13:53,912
I'm about to get my ass handed
to me by three captains.

254
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:08,672
Yes, I will call
the plumber today.

255
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,552
Are you always
gonna be in my head?

256
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,433
Well, I can't
control this thing.

257
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:17,141
You can't or you won't?

258
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,851
The painting is valuable.

259
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:22,683
Maybe they're
trying to steal it.

260
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:25,520
But if we don't deliver
it to Linderman...

261
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:27,313
we will never get the sword.

262
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:30,193
How long do we stay under here?

263
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:32,242
Until they are gone.

264
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:34,322
Who are these people?

265
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,822
And why is everyone
always chasing us?

266
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:39,030
Because I'm special.

267
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:41,250
Well I'm not special.

268
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,543
And I'm tired of
getting chased.

269
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,873
I'm going to have oil
all over my back...

270
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:47,170
because  of you!

271
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:48,883
You can surrender.

272
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,923
But I will never surrender.

273
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:53,172
A hero never gives up.

274
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:00,222
Did you feel something?

275
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:19,781
This way!

276
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:33,801
Hiro! Hiro!

277
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,301
Who are you?

278
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:36,763
Who are you?

279
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:37,840
Hiro!

280
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:39,301
Hey! Hello!

281
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:40,810
Let me go!

282
00:15:41,437 --> 00:15:43,182
I am very special.

283
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:45,313
I offer myself in trade.

284
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,480
Release un-special Ando,

285
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:51,321
and I go with you. Okay?

286
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,950
Good deal, yes. Oh!

287
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,740
Oh, what are you doing?

288
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:01,333
Oh, you no like the deal?

289
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:06,580
You came back for me.

290
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:10,462
This is how we roll.

291
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:22,183
Who are you?

292
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:27,312
Why did you take that off me?

293
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:30,062
I'm Dr. Witherson.
I'm a psychiatrist.

294
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:32,483
And I've been assigned
to your case.

295
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:35,110
No, you shouldn't be in here.
It's not safe.

296
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:36,842
If it makes you feel
more comfortable,

297
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:38,882
we can put the restraints
back on while we talk.

298
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,321
You don't understand.
The drugs keep her weak.

299
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:43,622
That jacket can't stop her.

300
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:46,120
- Give me a shot.
- You mean Jessica?

301
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,503
- How do you know her name?
- I read your file.

302
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:51,501
I know all about your past.

303
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:53,962
Your marriage.
Your website. Your sister.

304
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:55,880
Her accident?

305
00:16:56,217 --> 00:16:59,013
Her name was Jessica too,
isn't that right?

306
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:01,852
Give me another shot.

307
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,310
You know, I haven't made
an official diagnosis yet.

308
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,891
But it seems like
we're dealing with

309
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:11,150
a classic case of multiple
personality disorder.

310
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:13,022
You're wasting your time.

311
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,903
- Just go.
- You know...

312
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:20,243
It's okay. It's okay.

313
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:26,492
It makes sense, facing the kind
of sentence that you're facing,

314
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,001
that you want to give up.

315
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:30,212
You think your life is over,
but it's not.

316
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:32,710
You can still make something
of yourself in here.

317
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:35,213
People do it all the time.

318
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:37,460
But you gotta want help.

319
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:38,803
And yeah,

320
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:42,053
it can take years to integrate
a multiple personality,

321
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:46,773
but if you let me,
I can help you.

322
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,893
What I am, you can't fix.

323
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:52,943
Just give me another
shot and go away.

324
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,313
No.

325
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:12,123
Aww, man.

326
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:14,040
I'm trying to pay this rent.

327
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:17,210
You know,
it would really help if you...

328
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:18,882
Yeah.

329
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,172
No, it's...
It's cool, it's cool.

330
00:18:21,428 --> 00:18:23,641
I...  know you
would if you could.

331
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:26,433
Thanks anyway.

332
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,311
So have you seen my
lunchbox or not?

333
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,101
I don't know.

334
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,231
- It's wherever you left it.
- I left it in the car.

335
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:40,403
- Then that's where it is.
- Okay, so where's the car?

336
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:43,281
Car's in the shop, Micah.

337
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:45,663
- So you lost my lunchbox?
- I didn't lose anything.

338
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:49,830
- It's in the car.
- Fine, you make bad lunch anyways.

339
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,870
Micah!

340
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:54,080
Micah.

341
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:58,553
It's not my fault you can't
keep track of your own stuff.

342
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:01,880
Mom always put my lunch in my
backpack every single morning.

343
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:04,222
- Well, I'm not your mom.
- Yeah, that's for sure.

344
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:06,890
Micah, this isn't easy.

345
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:09,182
Well, it wasn't easy
for mom either.

346
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:12,560
But she always found a way
of making some money, Dad.

347
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,350
I'm late for school.

348
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:32,790
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this is?

349
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:36,503
You said if I had an emergency,
to hang the chimes outside my window.

350
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:39,500
- Is your father becoming suspicious?
- No.

351
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:42,171
And it's kind of a problem.

352
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,973
Every word out of
my mouth is a lie.

353
00:19:46,346 --> 00:19:50,352
I have to laugh, and smile,
and look him in the eye.

354
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:53,683
My own father,
it's breaking my heart.

355
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,270
Would you prefer I
took your memory?

356
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:02,483
I need to know that one
thing in my life is real.

357
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:07,612
Do you know who my
real parents are?

358
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,250
Of your father, I know nothing.

359
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,050
And my mother?

360
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:30,510
Only that she died in an explosion
here in Texas 14 years ago.

361
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:32,851
My mother died?

362
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:37,023
Are you sure?

363
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:39,273
Your father told
me many years ago.

364
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:41,311
He had no reason to lie.

365
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:49,282
This is the last conversation
we have about this.

366
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,160
Now you need to go back home,

367
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:55,583
and forget about
your real parents.

368
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,143
The groomer missed one of Mr.
Muggles' nails.

369
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:18,601
I'm gonna run him back by
the shop before they close.

370
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,700
Don't want you scratching
up my wood floors.

371
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:22,311
No, we don't.

372
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:23,770
Where's Claire?

373
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:27,320
She's at the library getting
books for some biology report.

374
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:30,452
I cannot believe how many
projects they lay on these kids.

375
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,852
I don't know how she holds
everything in that head of hers.

376
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:34,370
No, I don't.

377
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:38,543
You're still worried about her,
aren't you?

378
00:21:38,837 --> 00:21:40,460
She's had a rough
couple of weeks.

379
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,881
Well, besides a
little memory loss...

380
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:47,263
- I'd say she's doing just peachy.
- Do you really?

381
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:50,182
It's Lyle you need
to worry about.

382
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:54,763
That boy is getting so
absent-minded lately.

383
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:57,060
Yes, he is. We'll be back.

384
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:06,400
- Yes.
- I did everything I could.

385
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:08,071
He's dead.

386
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,911
Well, that's less than ideal.

387
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:14,702
What do you want me
to do with the body?

388
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:18,240
Get it ready for shipping.

389
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:19,750
I'll be in later.

390
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:49,623
There was a fire in an apartment
house 14 years ago in Kermit, Texas.

391
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:52,042
Kermit, why does that
sound so familiar?

392
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:54,543
'Cause of the frog?

393
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:57,713
Check it out.

394
00:22:57,717 --> 00:23:01,841
A 21-year-old woman was killed in
the explosion. Meredith Gordon.

395
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:03,633
Oh, my God.

396
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:06,720
Also killed in the fire was
her 18-month-old daughter.

397
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:09,433
Claire, I think that's you.

398
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:12,183
But I didn't die.

399
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:14,850
Somebody thought you did.

400
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:17,812
What am I supposed
to do with all this?

401
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:19,823
You may still have a
real family out there.

402
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:23,032
Maybe you got an aunt or a rich,
eccentric uncle.

403
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:24,993
Great, an uncle.

404
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:30,741
Who knows, one of them might even
know who your real father is.

405
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:42,383
Well...

406
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:46,470
Surprised you left out
the flying saucers.

407
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:48,933
Officer Parkman,
is this really the statement

408
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:51,390
you want entered into
your public record?

409
00:23:51,686 --> 00:23:54,100
That a paper salesman
from Odessa, Texas

410
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:57,981
is currently harboring a
super-powered serial killer,

411
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:00,903
and that you raided his
warehouse on a hunch?

412
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:05,200
Sir, all I've ever wanted to
do was protect and serve.

413
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,493
- To help my fellow man.
- I'll ask you again.

414
00:24:08,786 --> 00:24:11,620
Do you want your future
as a police officer

415
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:14,621
to be decided by what
you've written here?

416
00:24:15,215 --> 00:24:19,131
Just say "Yes," so I can
flush you down the toilet.

417
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:25,133
At this time, I'd like to recant
my previous written statement.

418
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:27,471
I made the whole thing up.

419
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:31,683
- Why did you do that?
- I failed to make detective three times, sir.

420
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:33,351
And, uh...

421
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:35,732
Quite frankly I was sick
of directing traffic,

422
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:37,850
handing out speeding tickets,
and I...

423
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:40,190
I wanted to look like a hero.

424
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:45,190
I am sorry for any shame that I
may have brought this department.

425
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:49,160
Great, a liar, not a nutcase.

426
00:24:51,376 --> 00:24:53,032
Officer Parkman,

427
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:56,120
pending review of your case
by a civilian ombudsman

428
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,162
and union representative,

429
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:02,790
we're enforcing a six-month
suspension of your active duties.

430
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:06,302
We're gonna need your
gun and your badge.

431
00:25:19,736 --> 00:25:21,190
Janice.

432
00:25:21,196 --> 00:25:23,982
Matt, will you come upstairs?

433
00:25:26,445 --> 00:25:29,493
- Oh, Matt!
- What?

434
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:31,953
Now are you gonna
fix the pipes?

435
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,953
Get me a wrench.

436
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:41,960
Where are you taking us?

437
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:45,341
Why isn't he talking to us?

438
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:47,011
Maybe...

439
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:48,551
he is not the Big Boss.

440
00:25:50,478 --> 00:25:54,430
Tell your boss I'm on
very important mission.

441
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:59,893
I know all about your so-called mission
to save the world, Mr. Nakamura.

442
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:01,563
You think you have a power,

443
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:04,151
and that you can use it
to make a difference.

444
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:06,440
You are...

445
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:08,110
WRONG.

446
00:26:08,407 --> 00:26:09,742
Who are you?

447
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:11,490
I work for someone...

448
00:26:11,746 --> 00:26:15,532
who has true power.

449
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:18,123
A man who knows
what you're up to.

450
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:22,373
And wants you...

451
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:25,003
to stop.

452
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:31,553
Two first class tickets.

453
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:34,761
- Non-stop to Tokyo.
- First class?

454
00:26:35,055 --> 00:26:36,682
Ando, do not be tempted.

455
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:38,350
Those tickets are a test...

456
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:40,602
of our devotion to our mission.

457
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:43,193
You cannot bribe a hero.

458
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:44,943
My heart is true.

459
00:26:45,155 --> 00:26:46,773
My spirit unbreakable.

460
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:48,323
When I meet your Big Boss,

461
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:49,901
I will tell him the same thing!

462
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:51,700
Oh-- they won't like that.

463
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,451
Not one bit.

464
00:27:25,696 --> 00:27:28,020
You aren't answering
your cell phone.

465
00:27:28,235 --> 00:27:29,863
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

466
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,650
- What's he doing here?
- Making up for past mistakes.

467
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,111
I'd like to help you.

468
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:39,121
- You're leaving town?
- Yeah.

469
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,082
Yeah, think I'd get away
for a little while.

470
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:44,663
What, be a danger
to somebody else?

471
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:46,623
There's gotta be
another way, Peter.

472
00:27:46,928 --> 00:27:48,172
- Let me help you.
- You can't.

473
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:49,753
- But maybe I can.
- How?

474
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:51,370
We can find that
answer together.

475
00:27:51,465 --> 00:27:52,801
If you allow me to test you,

476
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:54,260
- with more research...
- Shh...

477
00:27:54,476 --> 00:27:55,840
You can cure me?

478
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:57,640
You're gonna fix all of this?

479
00:27:57,898 --> 00:27:59,683
It'll take study and time...

480
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:02,431
Time... I don't have time
to be your guinea pig.

481
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:05,243
- I have a plane to catch.
- I'm not letting you run away, Peter.

482
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:07,603
So what,
you gonna call the cops on me, Nathan?

483
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:10,233
You gonna tell them your
brother's going nuclear?

484
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:15,280
I could have my mentally ill
brother detained for his own safety.

485
00:28:26,465 --> 00:28:28,581
I know you want to help me.

486
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:30,591
You're my big brother.

487
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:33,051
And you fix everything.
But you can't...

488
00:28:33,255 --> 00:28:36,171
- You can't fix this one this time.
- I can.

489
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:39,090
Look, let's just sit down,
and we can figure this out.

490
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:43,310
- Okay.
- Okay?

491
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:45,480
Okay.

492
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:50,020
Peter!

493
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:54,442
- Where'd he go?
- Who?

494
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:56,150
You're supposed to
watch the door.

495
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,743
My God, did he just...?

496
00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:59,961
Get down to the airport, and make
sure he doesn't get away this time.

497
00:28:59,998 --> 00:29:01,030
Yes, sir.

498
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:22,011
Thanks. Help yourself.

499
00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:23,811
- This your place?
- Yeah.

500
00:29:23,857 --> 00:29:26,641
Guy with family connections like
yours could do a lot better.

501
00:29:26,896 --> 00:29:29,312
Left the family business.
I'm a nurse now.

502
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,313
Nurse who's an empath,
very cute.

503
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:33,070
"Empath," what's that mean?

504
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:35,150
Means you're a pain
in my ass, mate.

505
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:38,112
Yeah, but you followed me.

506
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:40,871
Yeah, well,
I'm not very much of a people person,

507
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:43,120
but I'm certain I'm not
gonna let you kill 'em all.

508
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:45,773
You seem pretty sure about that
pending apocalypse of yours.

509
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:48,001
Yeah, not unless you
help me control it.

510
00:29:48,297 --> 00:29:50,833
You don't know what you're asking,
what you have to go through.

511
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:52,590
You might want to
reconsider dying.

512
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:54,921
- Hell of a lot easier.
- I can handle it.

513
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:57,173
Yeah, that'shat they all say.

514
00:29:57,725 --> 00:29:59,133
"They"?

515
00:29:59,516 --> 00:30:02,800
How many... how many people
have you taught before me?

516
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:09,022
Come on, mate,
I'll steal us a cab.

517
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:13,981
You coming or not?

518
00:30:38,057 --> 00:30:41,300
Uh, so they suspended
me for six months.

519
00:30:43,096 --> 00:30:44,852
Oh, Matt.

520
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:47,973
I actually thought this ability
was gonna be a good thing.

521
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:50,192
And now I'm unemployed, and

522
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:52,692
about to lose my marriage.

523
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:58,070
You haven't lost that.

524
00:30:58,577 --> 00:31:01,860
- Not yet anyway.
- Thanks, that's encouraging.

525
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:05,411
Look, we...

526
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:09,913
We just have to
trust each other.

527
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:13,333
I can do that.

528
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:21,881
Now...

529
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:27,760
So I'm gonna give
you one more freebie.

530
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:31,180
What am I thinking?

531
00:31:36,407 --> 00:31:38,273
We're having a baby?

532
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:46,031
We're having a baby!

533
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:56,792
Nik, what have
they done to you?

534
00:31:58,806 --> 00:32:01,130
- If they catch you...
- They won't.

535
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:04,931
Come closer.

536
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:06,391
What is it?

537
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:09,261
Your shirt.

538
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:12,601
It smells like home.

539
00:32:14,815 --> 00:32:16,400
How's Micah?

540
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:20,982
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

541
00:32:23,156 --> 00:32:24,570
It's just...

542
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:28,201
I can't do this, Nik.

543
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:29,991
Not alone.

544
00:32:30,996 --> 00:32:32,251
I thought I could.

545
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,383
I thought I could handle everything,
but I...

546
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:36,251
D.L., you can't do this to me.

547
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:38,751
I gotta find a way to
get you outta here.

548
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:40,922
This is crazy.

549
00:32:41,177 --> 00:32:42,770
I can walk in here any
time I want, right?

550
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:44,341
I should be able
to get you out.

551
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:46,593
I am gonna be in here
for a long time.

552
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:49,141
The rest of my life maybe.

553
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:53,141
- You need to get used to that.
- Your son needs you.

554
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:55,813
Damn it, D.L.,
that is not fair.

555
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:59,153
I am counting on you.

556
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:02,532
You know that I need
to stay in here.

557
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,532
I need you, Nik.

558
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:07,612
We need you.

559
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:12,373
He's having such a
hard time without you.

560
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:14,950
You need to talk to him.

561
00:33:16,588 --> 00:33:19,082
You need to be honest.

562
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:23,510
He needs boundaries
and a strong hand.

563
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:28,893
It's not too late.

564
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:36,433
You need to go.

565
00:33:38,238 --> 00:33:39,602
Go.

566
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:38,851
There's only 12 people in Kermit
with the last name "Gordon."

567
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:42,890
So far, only three.

568
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,941
None of them have ever
heard of Meredith.

569
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:48,823
- Claire?
- Hold on.

570
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:53,073
- I'll call you back.
- Claire?

571
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:56,532
Sorry, I was just, uh,

572
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:59,122
talking to Zach
about our report.

573
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:04,623
Well, Molly in accounting is
married to a marine biologist,

574
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:06,963
and he said that...

575
00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:09,250
You're already on top of it.

576
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:14,683
Did you know that all three varieties of
manatee are vulnerable to extinction?

577
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,552
No, I didn't.

578
00:35:23,026 --> 00:35:24,980
Is everything all right?

579
00:35:25,237 --> 00:35:27,113
We haven't talked in a while.

580
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,320
Actually, there is something.

581
00:35:31,155 --> 00:35:32,442
Yeah?

582
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:36,612
The bears.

583
00:35:37,128 --> 00:35:38,782
My stuffed bears.

584
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:42,162
I think it's time
for them to migrate.

585
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:48,170
I'm almost 16, Dad,
bears and talks can't last forever.

586
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:52,801
Whether you're 16,
or 32, or 64...

587
00:35:52,845 --> 00:35:55,423
- When I'm 64, you'll...
- I will be there for you.

588
00:35:56,227 --> 00:35:59,183
Always.

589
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:06,441
Don't you think it's time I learn
how to deal with my own problems?

590
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:20,992
Well, dinner's in an hour.

591
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:22,873
And, uh, do me a favor. No...

592
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:25,663
No extinction talk
at the table.

593
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:28,120
You know how sensitive
your mother is.

594
00:36:48,107 --> 00:36:49,771
You have a change of heart?

595
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:51,441
My son.

596
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:58,653
My family needs me. So...

597
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:01,821
I want you to understand that
there are no guarantees.

598
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:05,451
I don't care.
I need to get rid of Jessica.

599
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:08,870
So you know what might help?

600
00:37:11,586 --> 00:37:16,210
If I could talk to her.
All right?

601
00:37:16,218 --> 00:37:18,670
- Isn't there another way?
- No.

602
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,843
I'm afraid in cases like these,

603
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:23,142
it is imperative that
I have interaction

604
00:37:23,145 --> 00:37:25,811
with all aspects of the
patient's personality.

605
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:29,640
- Honey, let me talk to her.
- No!

606
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:32,560
You can't.

607
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:36,982
So let me put it to you this way.
Either I speak with Jessica,

608
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:41,323
or you may not see your little
boy for a very, very long time.

609
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:55,462
But...

610
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:57,802
Wait.

611
00:38:07,936 --> 00:38:09,893
Micah, where have you been?

612
00:38:10,107 --> 00:38:11,600
I was worried to death.

613
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:13,523
I was just out walking around.

614
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:15,821
Sit down.

615
00:38:23,497 --> 00:38:26,331
Micah, we gotta
figure this out.

616
00:38:26,668 --> 00:38:29,080
'Cause the truth is your
mom's not coming home,

617
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:31,752
and I'm having a
really hard time here.

618
00:38:32,216 --> 00:38:34,132
I can't get a job.

619
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:36,962
I can barely pay the rent.

620
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:42,302
I've never felt much
like a man in my life.

621
00:38:43,136 --> 00:38:45,390
My papa never taught me,

622
00:38:45,688 --> 00:38:49,392
but I want to be
a good dad to you.

623
00:38:49,647 --> 00:38:51,393
I'm gonna need your help.

624
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:54,691
We gotta pull together
and make this work.

625
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:57,902
- 'Cause it's just you and me.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

626
00:38:58,156 --> 00:38:59,942
I can try harder.

627
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,492
Maybe this will help.

628
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:18,590
Where'd you get...

629
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:21,013
Where'd you get this from?

630
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:24,051
You know how you and
Mom have a secret?

631
00:39:25,226 --> 00:39:28,263
Well, I have a secret too.

632
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:47,243
Where are we?

633
00:39:47,876 --> 00:39:49,950
Your secret headquarters?

634
00:39:50,586 --> 00:39:52,292
You let us go now?

635
00:39:52,505 --> 00:39:54,082
That's up to the boss.

636
00:40:02,636 --> 00:40:04,051
Hiro, please.

637
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:05,471
I don't want to meet the Boss.

638
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:06,802
I want to go home.

639
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:09,102
Tell them what
they want to hear.

640
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:12,312
Do not be afraid, my friend.

641
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:13,930
I shall never betray you.

642
00:40:14,065 --> 00:40:15,522
No matter what.

643
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:36,003
Father?

644
00:40:40,465 --> 00:40:41,791
GULP!

645
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:53,811
Hello?

646
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:58,391
Hi, I'm looking for someone
related to Meredith Gordon.

647
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:00,940
She died in an
explosion 14 years ago.

648
00:41:01,365 --> 00:41:05,692
I've been calling everyone in Kermit
with the last name of "Gordon."

649
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:09,662
- Any chance that you're related to her?
- Who is this?

650
00:41:09,956 --> 00:41:12,410
My name's Claire Bennet,
I'm calling from Odessa.

651
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:15,700
What... What is this about?

652
00:41:15,796 --> 00:41:18,291
And how do you know the
name "Meredith Gordon"?

653
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:20,711
I think she was my mom.

654
00:41:21,007 --> 00:41:23,043
Is this some kind of joke?

655
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:25,341
No, ma'am.

656
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:29,763
Well, Meredith only
had one daughter, and

657
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:32,091
she died in the fire.

658
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:36,180
That's kind of what
I'm trying to say is...

659
00:41:36,356 --> 00:41:38,101
I didn't die.

660
00:41:38,397 --> 00:41:43,400
I think I'm her and I'm looking for any
information I can find about my mom.

661
00:41:44,576 --> 00:41:49,702
Well, then you made the right call.
This is her.

662
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:52,071
Mom?

663
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:02,831
Yeah.

664
00:42:36,455 --> 00:42:37,913
How is Claire?

665
00:42:38,337 --> 00:42:41,873
