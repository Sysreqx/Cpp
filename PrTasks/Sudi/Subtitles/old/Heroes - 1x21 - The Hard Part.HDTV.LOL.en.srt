1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,633
<i>Previously on Heroes...</i>

2
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:04,922
<i>Ordinary people accross the globe</i>

3
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:07,773
<i>discovered extraordinary abilities.</i>

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,358
<i>After seeing a nightmare future...</i>

5
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:18,024
<i>... Hiro returned home to the present.</i>

6
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:21,944
<i>Claire's reunion with her real father</i>

7
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:23,625
<i>didn't go as planned.</i>

8
00:00:23,836 --> 00:00:25,714
I've a chance to be
a part of something big.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,593
The election...
and you need me to leave.

10
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:28,873
I need to win.

11
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:33,224
<i>Suresh gained a new ally
against the face of evil.</i>

12
00:00:33,427 --> 00:00:36,669
If that further stops Sylar,
it's for us to work together.

13
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:39,885
<i>But Sylar only grew more powerful...</i>

14
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:43,033
This is usualy the part
when people start screaming.

15
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:45,777
<i>... and eliminated the painter...</i>

16
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:48,407
<i>who could see the future.</i>

17
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:49,693
<i>And tonight,</i>

18
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:52,809
<i>the pieces draw closer in a final battle</i>

19
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:54,661
<i>to save the world.</i>

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,583
<i>And now, Heroes continues.</i>

21
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:45,834
Don't worry, New York!

22
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,030
We will save you!

23
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:02,448
Come on, boys.

24
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:04,455
Honey, we're home!

25
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,016
How's my girl?

26
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:12,449
- Daddy!
- Hey, boys, come here.

27
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,581
Anything interesting happen
while we were gone?

28
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:16,930
Nope, everything was...

29
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,807
unbelievably ordinary.

30
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:20,922
Wait'll you see what I got you, guys.

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,394
What do you think it is?

32
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:37,957
Paris is cold this time of year,

33
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,753
so here's a nice warm coat.

34
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,989
Brown wool.

35
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,899
It's not flashy, but it's fashionable.

36
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:47,475
Now let's talk about gloves.

37
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:53,635
I'll let you two say good-bye.

38
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:00,518
You can't leave.

39
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:01,749
I have to.

40
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,971
At least until the election's over.

41
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,435
I found you in Odessa.

42
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,204
We save each other,
you end up being my niece.

43
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:11,664
This isn't just random, okay?
This is destiny!

44
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:13,530
My father sacrificed himself

45
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:15,759
so that I could have a life,
not a destiny.

46
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:17,849
You can't save me, Peter...
not this time.

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,049
And Nathan can?

48
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:20,589
Nathan can keep me safe.

49
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:22,368
Safe?! You can't get hurt!

50
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,642
You're here to save the world.

51
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:30,191
How?

52
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:34,514
I'm sorry, I can't go around
chasing some fantasy.

53
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:39,257
It's not some fantasy, okay?

54
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:40,616
I explode.

55
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,353
I see it.

56
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:46,034
I wipe out this whole city.
You, Nathan, everyone.

57
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,392
You explode?

58
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:51,149
Like a nuclear bomb.

59
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,166
Nuclear?

60
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:55,790
Like Ted.

61
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,017
Ted?

62
00:03:58,724 --> 00:03:59,835
Who the hell is Ted?

63
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,470
- I told you no phone calls.
- It's my wife.

64
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,951
If this is a suicide mission, I'd like
to tell her I love her, say good-bye.

65
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,765
You think I don't want to talk
to my wife?

66
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:41,549
That I don't miss my son
and my daughter?

67
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:44,129
We're doing this to protect
the people we love.

68
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:47,346
The company has a new tracking system.

69
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:50,309
Now, this Walker System doesn't rely
on isotopes and satellites.

70
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,823
It just finds you wherever you are.

71
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,220
So we've gotta play this smart.

72
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:57,980
Switch cars, stay to the back roads.

73
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:01,953
Fine, we go to New York,
we wipe out the Walker System.

74
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,375
Exactly.

75
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:06,401
Yeah, almost done.

76
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:23,809
Let's go.

77
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,061
That man...

78
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:41,838
with the glowing hands.

79
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:49,370
He's the exploding man.

80
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,517
I'm going to take his power.

81
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,850
I'm going to explode?

82
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:05,639
Is this my future?
Is that what you saw, Isaac?

83
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:23,700
<i>Mohinder, I need your help.</i>

84
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,858
I think I'm gonna do something bad.

85
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:29,275
<i>You're a murderer.
You don't get the luxury of regret.</i>

86
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:32,078
You don't understand. I think
I'm gonna kill a lot more people.

87
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:33,998
<i>A lot more.</i>

88
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:38,643
<i>I understood it before the killing.
I had a reason</i>

89
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,003
to take what others didn't deserve.

90
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,468
It was natural selection.

91
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:45,329
What are you talking about?

92
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:46,684
An apocalypse.

93
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:50,062
A massacre.

94
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,972
Half the city gone in an instant.

95
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:54,311
They mean nothing.

96
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,810
They're innocent.

97
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,537
There's no gain, so why would I do it?

98
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:01,927
What possible reason could I have
for killing so many?

99
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,184
Wait, listen.

100
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,635
You don't have to.

101
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:07,341
If you're truly repentant
about what you've done,

102
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:08,849
<i>turn yourself in.</i>

103
00:07:10,123 --> 00:07:11,925
I can hear you dialing 911.

104
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:14,144
<i>It was a mistake to call.</i>

105
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,499
<i>No, wait! Sylar?</i>

106
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:34,550
subtitles: swsub.com

107
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:39,487
Where's Micah?

108
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,924
A car from the Corinthian Casino
picked him up.

109
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:44,017
That's Linderman's casino.

110
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:46,618
What aren't you telling me?

111
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:49,510
Linderman said
that he needed Micah for a job.

112
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
A job?

113
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,746
He's ten years old,
and you let him go?

114
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,136
Of course not!

115
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:55,473
I told him no.

116
00:07:58,384 --> 00:07:59,747
- What have you done?
- Me?

117
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:01,261
It was Linderman.

118
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:02,540
No, this is your fault!

119
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:03,872
Your responsibility!

120
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:06,062
I'm done with you.

121
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,881
I'll get Micah my damn self.

122
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,699
Don't let him go.

123
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,717
You're the one that can save Micah.

124
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:20,801
He's gonna get killed if he goes alone.

125
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:23,542
Please.

126
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:31,572
Wait!

127
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:44,195
Everything's under control,
Mr. Linderman.

128
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:45,885
He's a good kid.

129
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:48,782
Not that I mind the babysitting,

130
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,257
but don't you think
this is a waste of my talent?

131
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Thanks.

132
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,380
No, I appreciate that, I do.

133
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
I will.

134
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:02,225
Who was on the phone?

135
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:05,804
It was Mr. Linderman.

136
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,192
He wanted to make sure
that you were ready for tomorrow.

137
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,514
Isn't that nice?

138
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,625
Mom, I don't like Mr. Linderman.

139
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:17,662
Well, why not?

140
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:20,176
I don't know. He smells funny.

141
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:21,875
Mom, I don't like it here.

142
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,596
I don't want to do this.

143
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:25,527
I want to go home.

144
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:29,692
Mr. Linderman helped us,
and now we have to help him.

145
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:33,119
That's the last
that I want to talk about it, okay?

146
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,405
- But, Mom, I just don't...
- Micah, that's enough.

147
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:45,968
You know that I would never
let anything bad happen to you, right?

148
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:47,970
Give me a smile.

149
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,160
It's good to see you again, Professor.

150
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:10,981
So, have you thought about my offer?

151
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,584
Are you ready to come to work for us?

152
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,142
As far as I can tell, you're all a bunch
of untrustworthy gundas.

153
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:18,900
Is that a no?

154
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,861
No, I'm not going to work for you...
you're going to work for me.

155
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:26,722
You're going to show me
everything you do, everything you know,

156
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,259
and I'm going to use it
to help me stop Sylar.

157
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,409
And why would I do that?

158
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:33,822
You raided
my father's office in Chennai,

159
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,737
planted Eden as my next door neighbor.

160
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:38,447
You want what I have... the formula.

161
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:39,888
I can find more of them.

162
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,628
You're the one who needs me.

163
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:45,769
Some people died
because you led Sylar right to them.

164
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:49,560
And now you blame yourself,
so you become a vigilante.

165
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:52,248
- That's cute.
- Is that a no?

166
00:10:58,314 --> 00:10:59,637
What choice do I have?

167
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:03,388
Come on in.

168
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,468
What is this place?

169
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:12,884
There's someone you need to meet.

170
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,073
Molly Walker.

171
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,012
Does the name ring any bells?

172
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:18,447
- Yeah, she was on my father's list.
- That's right.

173
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:20,626
Your father led Sylar right to her.

174
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:24,029
He slaughtered her parents,
then attacked her.

175
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:27,618
- How did she survive?
- Well, luckily, we got to her.

176
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:29,171
That's what we do.

177
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:32,400
We find people with abilities,
help them,

178
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,904
protect them.

179
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,312
And she's sick, isn't she?

180
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:37,556
How can you tell?

181
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:40,301
Her nucleotides are decomposing.
You need to get her to a doctor.

182
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:43,515
A doctor can't help her.
I'm thinking maybe you can.

183
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:46,479
I'm a geneticist. I wouldn't know
the first thing about this.

184
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:48,318
Molly's virus is very rare.

185
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,499
It's destroying her nervous system.

186
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,946
It prevents her
from accessing her ability.

187
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:55,453
There's been one other case.

188
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,056
An Indian girl, 1974.

189
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:00,014
My sister.

190
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:02,949
Shanti died.

191
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:04,885
Yes, we know.

192
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:08,059
Sadly, your father developed a cure
a month too late.

193
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:09,842
Unfortunately for Molly,

194
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,484
our people can't figure out
what that cure is.

195
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:17,430
Cute, huh?

196
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:20,206
You're trying to manipulate me?

197
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:22,740
Showing me this poor girl,
preying on Shanti's memory.

198
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,880
Sylar is out there,
and he's planning a slaughter.

199
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:26,534
Everyone is in danger, and this...

200
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:27,988
None of this is going to help.

201
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:29,620
You just don't get it.

202
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,555
Molly is the only one
who can stop Sylar.

203
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:41,539
It's me.

204
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:44,200
I know it's been a while,
but I've been thinking about things.

205
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:46,772
Thinking about the future... my future.

206
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,631
I know it's last minute,
but if I could just come talk to you.

207
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:51,863
Can I come over?

208
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:54,638
Great.

209
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:57,635
I'll see you soon.

210
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:37,168
I can hear you.

211
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:45,765
Whoever you are...

212
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:48,693
come on out.

213
00:16:00,604 --> 00:16:02,179
You do that again, I will kill you.

214
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,262
You're lucky I didn't stuck your ass
in the wall after what you've done.

215
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,114
What the hell is this place?

216
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:09,917
It's where Linderman restores his art.

217
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,194
He usually hangs out in here.

218
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:14,607
What's that?

219
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:17,182
Is that supposed to be...

220
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,567
Micah?

221
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:19,795
Where is he?

222
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:21,637
I don't know, New York, maybe?

223
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:34,090
Our fourth grade report card.

224
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:36,884
Niki's immunization records.

225
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,298
School photos and medical files.

226
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,903
He's tracked our entire life.

227
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,410
This finally makes sense.

228
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,069
No, this is crazy.

229
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:52,141
Nobody does what you and I can do...

230
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:54,375
what Micah can do... nobody.

231
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:56,391
My life.

232
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,419
Me and Niki, everything we had,
it was...

233
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:01,705
it wasn't real.

234
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:04,454
It was all
Linderman's science experiment.

235
00:17:04,914 --> 00:17:07,560
All this time Linderman's
just been playing with our lives.

236
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:11,843
What are you doing?

237
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:14,712
Linderman obviously isn't here.
We're wasting our time.

238
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:17,835
If Linderman knows this much about us,
he must know something about Micah.

239
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,542
Where he went, what he's doing.

240
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,063
Linderman went to New York.

241
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:23,255
There is some note about Petrelli
on election day.

242
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:25,603
We find Linderman, we find Micah.

243
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,919
Let's get Micah the hell out of there.

244
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:33,269
Hi, Molly.

245
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:35,315
I'm Dr. Suresh,

246
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:37,894
and I need to take some blood,
if that's okay.

247
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:47,041
I want to stop the man
who hurt your family,

248
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:50,556
- and who tried to hurt you.
- You can't stop the boogeyman.

249
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,141
He sees into your soul,

250
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,385
and then he eats your brain.

251
00:17:57,654 --> 00:17:59,995
Well, you know
who can stop the boogeyman?

252
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:01,627
You.

253
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:03,460
I hear you have an amazing ability.

254
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,942
It's not so amazing.

255
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,474
They ask me where people are,
and I find them.

256
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:11,731
You find them? Anywhere in the world?

257
00:18:12,554 --> 00:18:15,840
Yeah, I just think about them,
and then I know where they are.

258
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:23,470
But it doesn't work right now.

259
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,166
Well,
that is a very special ability, Molly.

260
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:32,722
Because the boogeyman, he likes to hide.

261
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:35,820
But if you can tell us where he is,

262
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,419
we can make sure
he never comes back again.

263
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:41,102
You're different from the other doctors.

264
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:45,743
They're much better at this.

265
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:48,112
Thanks.

266
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,003
You're telling me
this guy Ted Sprague blew up your house?

267
00:18:59,677 --> 00:19:00,753
Yeah, pretty much.

268
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,115
Don't you see this, Nathan?

269
00:19:03,612 --> 00:19:04,889
Maybe I'm not the bomb.

270
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:07,981
Maybe this guy Ted Sprague is.
Maybe we can stop him.

271
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:10,513
You said you had a dream
that you blew up New York City.

272
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,448
I also dreamed that I could fly.
We know how that turned out for you.

273
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:14,701
You can fly?

274
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:17,897
That's cool.

275
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:19,735
The election is tomorrow.

276
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:21,828
Pick up the phone, call the FBI.

277
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,851
We need to find him.

278
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:29,238
Trust me.

279
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,961
I'll make a few calls.

280
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:43,370
You've been through a lot.

281
00:19:44,114 --> 00:19:45,114
You're very brave.

282
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:48,875
I just want you to know
that I admire that.

283
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:09,545
Mr. Linderman, we have a problem.

284
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:32,995
Oh, thank you, Lord,

285
00:20:33,177 --> 00:20:35,065
for bringing my Gabriel home safe.

286
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:38,104
Hi, Mom.

287
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:41,737
Thank you, Lord.

288
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:43,608
Come in, come in.

289
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:59,538
If I'd known you were coming,
I would have straightened up more.

290
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:03,914
I brought it from Texas.

291
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:05,831
- It's...
- For your collection.

292
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:07,216
Perfect!

293
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:09,429
One more, and I have the continent.

294
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:11,195
I'm just missing Oregon.

295
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:15,331
I hear it's beautiful there.

296
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,235
Green everywhere.

297
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:20,607
The clock's broken.

298
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:23,879
Oh, that old thing,
I should have thrown it away years ago.

299
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:26,237
It was Dad's.

300
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:27,924
It's junk.

301
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,602
It's a beautiful piece.
It just needs a little attention.

302
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,493
I can tell you how proud I am.

303
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:56,190
I haven't done anything.

304
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:58,675
You've traveled the world.

305
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:01,755
Some of us only get to see it
in snow globes.

306
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:05,702
I'm tired of traveling...
I think I might stay here.

307
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:08,222
In Queens?
Why would you ever come back?

308
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,657
If I stayed, maybe I could stop.

309
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,798
Maybe I wouldn't have to...

310
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:17,487
What?

311
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,274
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.

312
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:25,595
You want tuna fish?

313
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:27,315
Please don't, I'm not hungry.

314
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:29,302
Well...

315
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:32,673
If you insist on staying...

316
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:37,457
you should call Mr. Bilger...
that man from Smith & Barney.

317
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:38,810
You fixed his Rolex.

318
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:41,195
- Why would I call him?
- Because he said you should.

319
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:44,459
He said you were very talented,
and very special.

320
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:46,662
Maybe he could get you a job.

321
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,236
I have a job.

322
00:22:48,738 --> 00:22:49,890
I fix watches.

323
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:51,103
That's a hobby.

324
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,712
Investment banking
is a very lucrative field.

325
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:56,626
I can't be an investment banker.

326
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:58,109
You could be anything you want.

327
00:22:58,288 --> 00:22:59,862
Mom, he wouldn't even remember who I am.

328
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:02,574
- Who could forget you?
- You're not even listening to me!

329
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,176
I am listening.

330
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,337
You're making a tuna sandwich.

331
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,353
- So?
- I asked you not to.

332
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:15,110
I made a mistake.

333
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,177
I'm sorry!

334
00:23:21,996 --> 00:23:23,111
Mom, don't.

335
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:26,165
Don't, it's just...

336
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:30,509
maybe I don't have to be special.

337
00:23:32,216 --> 00:23:35,074
That's okay
to just be a normal watchmaker.

338
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,625
Can't you just tell me that's enough?

339
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,685
Why would I tell you that

340
00:23:47,173 --> 00:23:49,531
when I know you could be so much more?

341
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:56,467
If you wanted, you could be president.

342
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:07,296
What are we doing here?
Shouldn't we be looking for Ted?

343
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,042
The FBI and police wouldn't believe us.

344
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:11,825
They'll take Nathan seriously, though.
He can evacuate the people.

345
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:12,985
Wait.

346
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:15,648
What?

347
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:17,170
What is it?

348
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:18,486
That man.

349
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,217
That's the man my father works for.
He's the one I've been running from.

350
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:23,929
Wait a minute.

351
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:25,854
We don't know what's happening in there.

352
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,600
Linderman doesn't have a grasp
on the situation, Thompson.

353
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:30,130
And why would you think that?

354
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:31,781
All the pundits think I'm gonna lose.

355
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:33,329
And this morning my brother tells me

356
00:24:33,461 --> 00:24:35,371
about a fella named Ted Sprague...
ring a bell?

357
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,953
We know all about Sprague.

358
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:39,867
I don't appreciate being kept
in the dark. Especially not today.

359
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:42,471
Oh, God,
I can't believe I've been so stupid.

360
00:24:42,643 --> 00:24:45,631
My father took a bullet to keep me
from that man, and now he's with Nathan.

361
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:47,071
It can't be what you think.

362
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:49,508
- Why do you keep running back to him?
- He's my brother.

363
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,709
The truth is, you have no idea
what's gonna happen.

364
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,359
You're nervous.

365
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:55,801
Nervous?

366
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:58,853
You want to blow up half of New York.

367
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,436
Yes, we do.

368
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:02,918
- You're scared.
- Yeah, I am.

369
00:25:03,082 --> 00:25:05,172
I'm terrified.
I have to find a nuclear man,

370
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:07,298
and I don't know
if I can contain all that power.

371
00:25:07,425 --> 00:25:08,497
Then run the other way.

372
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:09,683
- I can't.
- Why not?

373
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:12,396
Because if we save ourselves,
who's gonna save everyone else?

374
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,378
Why are you asking me
to make this sacrifice?

375
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,193
For the best of reasons.

376
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:20,636
You're not alone, Claire.

377
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:22,374
All right?

378
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:25,442
You coming?

379
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:35,976
No... this is crazy.

380
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:38,642
I'm getting out of here.

381
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:44,150
Micah, I'm gonna go hop in the shower.

382
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:47,537
You gonna be okay?

383
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:51,458
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry
that I talked back to you earlier.

384
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,412
I know that you just want what's best.

385
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:56,611
Thanks.

386
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,591
Who are you?

387
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:48,115
How'd you do that?

388
00:26:48,711 --> 00:26:50,540
I can make you see anything I want.

389
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:52,679
Makes it kind of hard to get away, huh?

390
00:26:53,617 --> 00:26:54,653
Where's my mom?

391
00:26:57,531 --> 00:26:59,880
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

392
00:27:00,216 --> 00:27:01,216
I like you.

393
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:05,225
But if you don't listen
to what Mr. Linderman says,

394
00:27:05,842 --> 00:27:08,766
well, I'll show you things
that'll seriously mess you up for life.

395
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:12,347
So you need to behave.

396
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,227
What if I told you
that I can be special?

397
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:38,966
Important.

398
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:43,871
But to do it, I'd have to hurt
a lot of people. Should I?

399
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,858
You? You can never hurt anyone.

400
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:50,989
There's a lot of things that I can do
that you don't know about.

401
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:55,958
I have something to show you.

402
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,120
What are you doing?!

403
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:21,738
I know how much you love snow globes.

404
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:24,293
How did you...

405
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:21,903
I'm sorry, Molly.

406
00:29:22,216 --> 00:29:23,638
I didn't mean to frighten you.

407
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:26,213
You can't help me either.

408
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:27,437
It's okay.

409
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:29,008
No, actually,

410
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:31,435
my father did find a cure.

411
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:33,898
It's called an antibody.

412
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:37,091
Unfortunately,
we don't know where or what it is.

413
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:39,897
It's hiding, like the boogeyman.

414
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:41,824
Exactly.

415
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,315
Who's that?

416
00:29:49,313 --> 00:29:51,399
It's my sister Shanti.

417
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:53,983
She's very pretty.

418
00:29:56,013 --> 00:29:57,905
This is the first time
I've ever seen her.

419
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,465
She died before I was born.

420
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,625
Am I going to die?

421
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:11,518
Molly, my father did everything
he could to save my sister.

422
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:13,986
He was just a few months too late.

423
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:16,715
I won't be, I promise.

424
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,692
What's this?

425
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:26,288
It'll protect you from the boogeyman.

426
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:31,437
Thank you.

427
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:02,067
Please.

428
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:04,684
I'm sorry I scared you, just come out

429
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:06,952
and talk to me. Please.

430
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:12,055
Mom?

431
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:46,774
I saw a vision of the future...

432
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,738
and I'm gonna kill a lot of people.

433
00:31:53,422 --> 00:31:55,120
Tell me why I would do that.

434
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:06,521
Mom?

435
00:32:31,872 --> 00:32:32,921
I'm leaving.

436
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:36,368
And when I get back,
I expect you to be gone.

437
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:39,554
Don't say that, Mom.

438
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:41,546
- It's Gabriel.
- You're not Gabriel.

439
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,045
You're damned,

440
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:46,212
and I want you out of my house.

441
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:48,602
Let go!

442
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:50,242
- Get away from me!
- Mom, calm down.

443
00:32:50,388 --> 00:32:51,605
- Get away!
- Calm down.

444
00:32:51,784 --> 00:32:53,084
I want my son.

445
00:32:54,031 --> 00:32:56,912
What did you do with my son?
Give me back my boy.

446
00:32:57,585 --> 00:32:58,789
Mom, please, it's me.

447
00:32:59,472 --> 00:33:01,109
It's me, Mom, please...

448
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:05,643
My Gabriel...

449
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:08,518
- Stop it!
- You're not... you're not!

450
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:43,663
I'm sorry.

451
00:33:57,547 --> 00:33:58,552
That heartbeat...

452
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:01,133
You were in the loft.
Why are you following me?

453
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:03,120
I must stop you.

454
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:04,389
Then do it.

455
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,479
Do it! Kill me!

456
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,320
You can't, you coward.

457
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:15,577
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

458
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:39,575
You did it.

459
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:41,011
You found the cure.

460
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:42,809
Where was it?

461
00:34:43,443 --> 00:34:44,528
It was in me.

462
00:34:46,123 --> 00:34:47,123
Sometimes...

463
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:50,984
when a Mommy and Daddy
have a sick child,

464
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,319
they have another baby.

465
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,171
A healthy baby

466
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:56,985
with healthy antibodies.

467
00:34:58,489 --> 00:34:59,812
And if we're very lucky,

468
00:35:01,178 --> 00:35:05,571
the healthy baby's blood
will heal the sick baby.

469
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:11,409
Unfortunately, I was born
a little too late to help my sister.

470
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,643
But I'm not too late to help you.

471
00:35:56,132 --> 00:35:57,958
You weren't even going to say good-bye?

472
00:35:58,943 --> 00:35:59,943
Good-bye.

473
00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:02,919
I think I figured a way
for you to save the world.

474
00:36:05,943 --> 00:36:07,005
A gun?

475
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:09,669
That's how I save the world...
that's your plan?

476
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:10,966
I can handle Ted.

477
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:15,058
But if I lose it, you're the only one
who can get close enough to stop me.

478
00:36:17,812 --> 00:36:19,426
Right through the back of the head.

479
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:20,628
You know the spot.

480
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:23,100
Same place
you pulled the piece of glass from.

481
00:36:23,374 --> 00:36:25,014
My destiny is not to shoot you.

482
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:28,331
- The universe cannot be that lame.
- You cannot run away from who you are.

483
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:31,018
- This bomb is happening.
- How can you be so sure?

484
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,856
Because I can draw the future.

485
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:37,661
I met a guy who can do it,
now I can do it, you see?

486
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:40,572
Someone's gonna blow.

487
00:36:41,087 --> 00:36:42,255
Me, Ted...

488
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,776
It doesn't really matter.

489
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:46,887
It's happening around the election,
unless you stop it.

490
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:48,411
That's Ted.

491
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,129
You drew Ted.

492
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:52,631
Are you sure?

493
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,745
I'll never forget that face.

494
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,693
That's Kirby Plaza, midtown.

495
00:36:58,505 --> 00:36:59,903
Ted is here in New York.

496
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:01,944
Don't you see, Claire?
You're part of this.

497
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:04,649
But you have to do this.

498
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:14,958
Thank you, Benjamin.

499
00:37:16,155 --> 00:37:17,438
What are you doing here?

500
00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:20,076
I didn't think I'd see you
till later tonight.

501
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:23,873
A mother can't be worried about her son
on the most important day of his life?

502
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,232
I was just working on the speech...
some details of the concession.

503
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,358
I'm not talking about the election.

504
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:31,617
Linderman called me.

505
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:33,478
He said you're getting cold feet.

506
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,694
It's natural to feel ambivalent.

507
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:40,892
Nobody expects you to feel otherwise.

508
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,810
So I wanted to give you perspective.

509
00:37:44,956 --> 00:37:46,412
You know about Linderman's plans?

510
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:48,727
Yes. Well, they're not just Linderman's.

511
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,949
A lot of people put time and care
into making this a reality.

512
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,217
Myself included.

513
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:55,648
- You?
- Yes, you don't know everything

514
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:57,023
about me, Nathan.

515
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,074
But I do know everything about you.

516
00:38:00,622 --> 00:38:02,434
And I know what you're capable of.

517
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:03,968
Do you think I'm a mass murderer?

518
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,610
Important men make impossible decisions.

519
00:38:07,073 --> 00:38:10,824
President Truman dropped 2 atomic bombs
on Japan to end World War II.

520
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:13,122
Killed thousands to save millions.

521
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:15,157
That was different, Ma, we were at war.

522
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,551
I can't accept this.

523
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:20,596
That is your one weakness, Nathan...
You have no faith.

524
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,088
So how could you possibly believe
this bomb

525
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:25,475
could actually heal the world

526
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:28,147
if you have no faith
in the idea of destiny?

527
00:38:29,816 --> 00:38:31,319
Your destiny, Nathan,

528
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:35,600
is to set the course of history
after this unspeakable act has occurred.

529
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:38,912
The people will look back on what you do

530
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:42,728
as the freshman congressman
from New York,

531
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:44,626
and they will thank you.

532
00:38:45,903 --> 00:38:49,197
For your strength, for your conviction,

533
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:51,738
for your faith.

534
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:01,080
In my day,
we called it being presidential.

535
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,125
Can you believe?

536
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:28,875
Can you be the one we need?

537
00:39:36,437 --> 00:39:37,437
That's my boy.

538
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:56,359
You were right, Mom.

539
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:00,609
I am meant to be special,
just like you wanted.

540
00:40:02,457 --> 00:40:03,625
I can be anything.

541
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,760
I can even be president.

542
00:40:30,674 --> 00:40:31,944
There's no sign of them.

543
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,435
What's wrong?

544
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:41,313
I'm not normal.

545
00:40:43,946 --> 00:40:47,571
I tried to pretend that I was,
and I just hurt everyone.

546
00:40:47,742 --> 00:40:49,144
My Mom, my Dad.

547
00:40:51,936 --> 00:40:54,213
I ruined everything
because of what I am.

548
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060
I hated it.

549
00:40:58,508 --> 00:40:59,540
But you...

550
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:02,128
when I met you,

551
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:05,268
I finally felt like
I was a part of something.

552
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:07,187
That's funny.

553
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:09,476
I felt the same thing when I met you.

554
00:41:18,945 --> 00:41:20,003
Dad.

555
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,705
I love you, Claire Bear.

556
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:46,997
What's he doing?

557
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,443
He's absorbing your ability.

558
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:53,375
He's gotta make it stop.
