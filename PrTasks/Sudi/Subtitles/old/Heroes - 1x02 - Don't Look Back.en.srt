1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:04,308
Previously on Heroes.

2
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:06,281
Five strangers
accross the globe

3
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:09,907
began to discover they have
extraordinary abilities.

4
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:13,531
From the cheerleader who
realized she's invincible.

5
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:15,648
I have busted every
bone in my body.

6
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,388
And I don't have
a scratch on me!

7
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,529
To the office worker who
can bend space and time.

8
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,406
These strangers are discovering

9
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:25,474
they're meant for
something more.

10
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,550
Do you ever get the
feeling like you were meant

11
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:30,341
to do something extraordinary?

12
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:34,681
And as a son seeks the truth by
finishing his father's work...

13
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:36,180
I spoke to him 2 days ago.

14
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,530
He was this close to
finding the 1st of them.

15
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:44,390
He's forced to run from a
man surrounded in mystery.

16
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:46,560
He left everything
behind but his computer.

17
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:51,170
A man who's more conencted
than anyone imagine.

18
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:54,460
- Hi, daddy.
- Hey, baby.

19
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:58,373
And now Heroes continues.

20
00:01:00,137 --> 00:01:01,720
Chapter Two
Don't Look Back.

21
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:04,972
We all imagine ourselves
the agents of our destiny,

22
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:08,311
capable of determining
our own fate.

23
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,750
But have we truly any
choice in when we rise?

24
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:13,390
Or when we fall?

25
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:17,913
Or does a force larger than
ourselves bid us our direction?

26
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:21,440
Is it evolution that
takes us by the hand?

27
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:23,741
Does science point our way?

28
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:29,402
Or is it God who intervenes,
keeping us safe?

29
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:35,201
- Whoa, whoa, easy, buddy.
- Where am I?

30
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:37,260
You're in a hospital.

31
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,021
What happened?

32
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:44,421
- You don't remember?
- No.

33
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:49,773
You jumped, Pete.

34
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:51,861
- Jumped?
- Yeah.

35
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:57,491
Off the roof of a
15-story building.

36
00:01:57,588 --> 00:02:02,250
You tried to kill yourself.
You were a little wound up yesterday.

37
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:04,331
But I thought you
were just being you.

38
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:07,360
What are you talking about?
I didn't...

39
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:09,712
I didn't try to kill myself.

40
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:12,430
You were in the alley below.

41
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:14,313
I jumped, and...

42
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:16,042
then you...

43
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:23,392
- You flew.
- I what?

44
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:25,933
You flew up and you caught me.

45
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:33,052
You jumped... Peter.
25 feet to a fire escape.

46
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:37,840
I climbed up and carried you down.
That's what happened.

47
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:42,570
The rest is just crazy talk.

48
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:44,291
You understand?

49
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:13,871
Dad... you mind if I talk
to you about something?

50
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:21,232
- You pregnant?
- What? No.

51
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:23,152
- You doing drugs?
- Dad!

52
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:28,220
Actually... I already
know what it's about.

53
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:30,041
You do?

54
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:31,980
It's about wanting to
know who you really are.

55
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:34,901
Your mother told me that you've been
asking about your birth parents.

56
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,731
Well, I think it's
time that I knew.

57
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:39,010
Well, I have a few
questions first.

58
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:41,121
Not the least of
which is why now?

59
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,143
I'm just wondering, that's all.

60
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,922
You know, what they're like,
what they can do.

61
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:49,820
- What they can do?
- Yeah, like hobbies and...

62
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:51,252
skills.

63
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,572
You know, I don't...
mean this to be condescending.

64
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:01,352
Even though you're gonna
say I'm being condescending.

65
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:04,041
But I really do believe that
this is an adult decision.

66
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:05,823
You're right.
That is condescending.

67
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,361
Claire, there are
gonna be issues.

68
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:09,683
You're going to have issues.
They're going to have issues.

69
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,241
It's very complex, emotionally.

70
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:13,731
- Yeah, well, so am I.
- Well, exactly.

71
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:20,730
Look, here's my advice,
if you'll indulge me. Just...

72
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:24,921
keep things light and fun as long
as you can. Like cheerleading.

73
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:29,111
Being a cheerleader is hard work.
Hard, treacherous work.

74
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,101
- Of course it is, sweetheart.
- I don't wanna be late.

75
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:33,702
Hey...

76
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,393
I just don't want you to be in
such a hurry to grow up, okay?

77
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:43,671
Trust me.
I actually know a few things.

78
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:30,952
Who are you?!

79
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,122
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sorry, sorry! Easy, easy.

80
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:36,693
Your super let us in.
We're doing the whole building today.

81
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:40,080
I just got done with the lady
with the dog and the cough.

82
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:41,903
Almost done here.

83
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:46,941
Uh, listen, it looks like some
cockroaches might have infested
your, uh,

84
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:48,620
floorboards.

85
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:57,501
Who are you?!
What did you do to my father?

86
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:05,882
Let's take a little breather,
huh, professor?

87
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,322
I suppose the cockroaches
are the least of my problems.

88
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:09,491
Yeah, no argument there.

89
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:11,022
Did you kill my father?

90
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,821
I think we're done here,
don't you?

91
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:15,771
So I'll tell you what.
Have a really great day.

92
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:31,313
Hey, look,
I'm just the exterminator.

93
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:32,902
This guy came in and
pulled a gun on me.

94
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,192
- He is not an exterminator.
- He's paranoid.

95
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:37,443
I was just in there spraying
bugs in his apartment.

96
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:38,880
He came in and freaked out.

97
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:43,161
If you're the exterminator,
why do you have a gun holster?

98
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:56,462
- Thanks for coming to my rescue.
- You're welcome.

99
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:58,391
Mohinder  Suresh.

100
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,921
The professor's son.

101
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,630
Yatai!

102
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:37,910
Hello, New York!

103
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:42,823
Hello. Nice to meet you.

104
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:44,272
I love New York!

105
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:46,580
Hello!

106
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,032
Whassup?

107
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,672
Britney Spears.

108
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:52,300
Go, Yankees!

109
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:13,143
Hey! Pal! This isn't a library.

110
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,741
No pay, no read.

111
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,752
Hey,  get back here!

112
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:35,061
Synchro: Travis - Transcript: Raceman

113
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:44,363
- Simone--
- Shh, you had a hard night.

114
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:45,433
I saw it.

115
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:50,311
There was a... bright light.
Like an explosion.

116
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:53,413
It wiped out the whole city.
Like Hiroshima--

117
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:55,642
Shh, shh, shh, it's okay.
It was all a dream.

118
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,640
- No... I don't think so.

119
00:09:57,786 --> 00:09:58,202
Yes.

120
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,123
I shot up last night. I had to.

121
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:00,633
Yes.

122
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,362
I painted what I saw.
Is it there? Do you see it?

123
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,620
Yes, I see it!
But you need to rest.

124
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:08,442
- We have to warn them.
- Uh! Warn who?

125
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:11,023
F.B.I., Homeland Security.
We need to tell someone.

126
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:14,253
Isaac, you can't paint the future.
No one will believe you.

127
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:17,723
- I'd hoped you would.
- None of it is real.

128
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,983
What is real is,
you got a drug problem.

129
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,981
You overdosed on heroin last night.
You're lucky to be alive.

130
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:26,992
You know,
I'm watching my father die.

131
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:31,030
And I can't watch you die too.

132
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:36,121
So you need to make a choice.
Me or this.

133
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,992
It's not about
having big hands.

134
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:52,903
Most guy's hands are too
rough to pick out the details.

135
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:56,580
Mine are sensitive.
Feel how soft they are.

136
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:57,930
Wow.

137
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,463
But you've got dainty hands.

138
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:04,730
My mom says my hands
are very dainty.

139
00:11:05,758 --> 00:11:08,010
Maybe I should try out
for the football team.

140
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:11,712
Claire, may I borrow your
ears just for a minute?

141
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:12,841
- Why?
- Hey, Zach!

142
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:16,550
Is it true you got an erection
in the boys' locker room?

143
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:19,570
- It's really urgent--
- Not now. Not now.

144
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:23,151
Claire, Jackie.

145
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:26,641
The sheriff and some firemen would
like to have a word with you two.

146
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:28,020
Okay.

147
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:33,091
Hi, this is Niki.
Leave me a message.

148
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:38,171
Mom...are you there?
When are you coming to get me?

149
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:41,041
I hate it here.
You said you'd be back soon.

150
00:11:41,185 --> 00:11:43,342
Just come pick me up, okay?

151
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:16,210
Honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm on my way.

152
00:12:16,488 --> 00:12:19,401
Baby, I'm only five
minutes away, okay?

153
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,453
You know I love you.

154
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:49,831
Come on.

155
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,382
Yeah.

156
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:56,273
That's the way I like it.

157
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,943
Go ahead. Come on.

158
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:03,020
What's the problem, baby?

159
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:05,182
Things  just started
getting good here.

160
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,530
I said what's the problem?

161
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:12,223
Screw you.

162
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:49,230
Hello?

163
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:52,990
Mom... where have you been?
I called you, like, four hours ago.

164
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:56,620
- What? Four hours?
- Yeah.

165
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:58,721
I'll be right there, baby.

166
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:11,363
What is the matter with you,
making him wait like that?

167
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:12,422
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:14,893
Hon, two seconds.

169
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:20,051
Okay. What the hell
is going on, Niki?

170
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:21,741
Something terrible
has happened.

171
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:22,701
What? What is it?

172
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,890
Those guys that you said that Linderman
would send to get his money back...

173
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:27,511
- Yeah?
- Well, he did.

174
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,601
And now they're dead.
On the floor of my garage.

175
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:34,120
What? How?

176
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:37,220
That's just it. I don't know.

177
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:38,782
What do you mean
you don't know?

178
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:40,032
I mean I don't know.

179
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:42,851
I just--
I woke up, and they were dead and...

180
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:44,970
I think that I might...

181
00:14:47,197 --> 00:14:49,490
Sometimes I look
in the mirror...

182
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:52,642
and I'm not sure it's
me that I'm seeing.

183
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,102
Maybe it was DL, you know?

184
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:56,791
He's trying to protect you because
he still loves you and Micah.

185
00:14:56,825 --> 00:15:00,350
DL wouldn't risk coming back.
The cops are after him.

186
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,923
And once Linderman
finds out they're dead,

187
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:05,851
it's not gonna matter who killed them.
He's gonna come after me.

188
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:09,132
Then you need to listen to me.
Niki, you have to call the police.

189
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:16,303
No, I gotta cover my tracks.
And then I gotta run.

190
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,133
I gotta go.

191
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:34,840
Why would anybody wanna
tap Papa Saresh's phone?

192
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,290
Papa Saresh?

193
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:40,162
Yeah, he told me to call him that after
I butchered his name a couple times.

194
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:42,840
I don't know why someone
would want to tap his phone.

195
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,453
Back in Madras,
I found a man in his apartment

196
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,612
stealing his research,
and now this.

197
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:51,561
Why don't you just ask your dad?
He must have some idea who it is.

198
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:53,531
My father died four days ago.

199
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:54,771
What?

200
00:15:56,945 --> 00:16:00,341
I'm sorry, I...
You didn't know?

201
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:01,883
He was murdered in his cab.

202
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,982
Oh, my God. How awful.

203
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:07,365
You were close?

204
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:09,862
Yeah... I mean,
I hate cooking for one.

205
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,743
So I used to make extra and
bring it over, and we would...

206
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,302
eat together, and he'd tell me
about his theories and the map.

207
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,493
We were friends.

208
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:26,822
Well... then you were
closer to him than I was.

209
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:31,612
I'm happy to hear he
had someone to talk to.

210
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:34,143
I'll get you some water.

211
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:37,353
I had no idea anything
was wrong. I...

212
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:40,362
I knocked on the door a couple of times.
I just...

213
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:43,321
I thought he was out,
and we were missing each other.

214
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,343
I had this book I
wanted to show him.

215
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,891
What book?

216
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:48,883
Darwin's Origin of Species.
Thank you.

217
00:16:49,646 --> 00:16:51,523
It's a true first edition.

218
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,632
I work at this
antique book store,

219
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:56,413
and I found a copy,
and I just...

220
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,390
thought he'd get a kick
out of reading it.

221
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,421
Well, he most definitely would
have gotten a kick out of it.

222
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:03,361
That's very thoughtful.

223
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:06,611
You know,
he told me he was being watched.

224
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:09,293
I thought that he
was just eccentric.

225
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:13,190
I like that you didn't
use the word "paranoid."

226
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:15,362
Do you think that
they're watching you now?

227
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:18,130
They could have killed me,
if that's what they wanted.

228
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:21,610
For the time being, it seems I'm
more important to them alive.

229
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:24,912
You said that he talked to you
about his theories and the map.

230
00:17:24,947 --> 00:17:27,122
I need you to tell me
everything he said to you.

231
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:30,780
Everything you
remember. Everything.

232
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:34,481
Girls! This isn't a...

233
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:36,883
criminal investigation.

234
00:17:36,978 --> 00:17:40,363
Nobody here is in any kind of trouble.
Quite the contrary.

235
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,812
There just happens to
be a very grateful man

236
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:46,062
lying in the hospital who'd
like to thank one of you for...

237
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,501
saving his life yesterday.

238
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:50,820
I've never seen anyone so
reluctant to be called a hero.

239
00:17:50,857 --> 00:17:52,552
You're sure it was one
of our cheerleaders?

240
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:55,311
The uniform said
Union Wells High.

241
00:17:56,427 --> 00:17:58,632
I'd  have to say it was...

242
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:02,030
her on the end.

243
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,061
That's Claire Bennett.

244
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:06,111
Claire...

245
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:09,312
where'd you go yesterday
after cheerleading practice?

246
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:11,912
I, uh...

247
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:15,443
It wasn't her. It was me.

248
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:20,640
I was taking a shortcut
home from school, and...

249
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:27,842
I saw the wreckage of the train...
wreck. And...

250
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:29,932
I just had to help.

251
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,662
Why didn't you say something?

252
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:35,042
I guess I didn't want all the attention,
you know?

253
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:37,450
That's not why I did it.

254
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:40,740
Well, on behalf of the
Odessa Fire Department,

255
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:44,271
I'd like to congratulate you
as an honorary firefighter.

256
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,722
- How is he?
- Who?

257
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,580
The man Jackie pulled
out of the train.

258
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:56,790
He's got some pretty bad burns.

259
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,750
Smoke damage to his lungs, but...
he's alive.

260
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,863
Happy to be so.

261
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,713
Thanks to Jackie.

262
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:16,981
Claire!

263
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,923
I'm glad I finally got you alone.
Look, we have to talk.

264
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:22,273
Did you hear they asked Jackie

265
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,392
to be the Grand Marshall
of the Pioneer Day Parade?

266
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:26,512
They're gonna put her on
the top of the fire truck.

267
00:19:26,546 --> 00:19:28,442
They should put her
under the fire truck.

268
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:29,621
It's about the videotape.

269
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:30,570
- What?
- The videotape!

270
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:33,090
The  tape where you're, like,
killing yourself like 20 times.

271
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:35,043
Oh, yeah, that.
Can we just keep it under wraps?

272
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:36,501
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

273
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:38,133
It was in my backpack,
and now it's not.

274
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,282
- What?
- It's gone.

275
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:42,022
What do you mean, it's gone?

276
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:52,202
Oh, my God! Claire!
I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

277
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:55,492
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm all right.

278
00:19:57,347 --> 00:19:59,090
Yeah. You just
caught me off guard.

279
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:00,781
I thought I heard
something snap.

280
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:07,183
Nope. I'm okay!
I'm fine! I'm okay.

281
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:12,300
Yeah, not a scratch on me.

282
00:20:12,397 --> 00:20:14,581
Guess you're not so
dainty after all.

283
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,021
I'm dainty enough.

284
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:23,620
We have got to find that tape.

285
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,592
Whoo!

286
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,592
What if I don't want
to go on vacation?

287
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:47,580
You don't have a choice.
You have to.

288
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:49,672
Why are we doing this, Mom?

289
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:52,313
Why won't you just tell
me what's going on?

290
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:56,222
I wish that I could, baby.

291
00:20:56,316 --> 00:20:58,615
But you are just gonna
have to trust me, okay?

292
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:00,092
Now go in and pack
up your stuff.

293
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,470
I have to take care of
something in the garage.

294
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:12,513
Mom... What happened
to our house?

295
00:21:12,658 --> 00:21:15,432
Mikey, you're just gonna
have to trust me, okay?

296
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:19,561
Now go in and grab
some stuff. Go.

297
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:39,891
In the trunk. Follow the map.

298
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:44,862
Help me understand what you
were doing on that roof.

299
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,923
I can't. Not yet. But I will.

300
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:50,212
You just have to trust me.

301
00:23:56,428 --> 00:23:59,711
There's something you need to
know about your father's death.

302
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:02,613
He committed suicide.

303
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:04,052
What?

304
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:06,252
He committed suicide.

305
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:08,741
I found him on the
floor of the bathroom.

306
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:10,982
- You said he had a heart attack.
- I lied.

307
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:14,470
For his reputation,
his heart was fine.

308
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:16,871
But he'd had two
others before that.

309
00:24:16,968 --> 00:24:20,731
Well, I lied about those too.
Suicide attempts, both of them.

310
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,661
He finally got what he wanted.

311
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:32,152
When he was 23, he was diagnosed
with major depressive disorder.

312
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:35,543
He couldn't help it.
It was just who he was.

313
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:37,723
Why didn't I know about
any of this before?

314
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:40,301
Your father and I decided
not to tell you since the

315
00:24:40,336 --> 00:24:44,191
disorder can have a genetic link,
and you were always so sensitive.

316
00:24:44,336 --> 00:24:46,312
We didn't want you
to worry about it.

317
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:48,932
But you're telling me now.

318
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:53,632
It can start with
delusions of grandeur.

319
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:57,178
Thinking you're invincible
or indestructible.

320
00:24:57,219 --> 00:25:01,133
They are irrational thoughts
that then turn suicidal.

321
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:03,811
It's time you took a
hard look at your life.

322
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:09,400
And if there are changes to be made,
I want to be here to help you.

323
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:14,971
Because there's something
else I never told you.

324
00:25:15,988 --> 00:25:17,060
Come here.

325
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:24,661
You were always my favorite.

326
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:28,451
I cannot lose you.

327
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:49,031
Mr. Isaac Mendez?

328
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:54,831
Hello?

329
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:58,563
Mr. Isaac?

330
00:26:27,757 --> 00:26:29,022
Mr.  Isaac?

331
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:50,650
Mr. Isaac?

332
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:59,682
Freeze! Drop your weapon.

333
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:03,281
Get your damn hands up.

334
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,692
Serial killer strikes
in the middle of L.A.,

335
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:16,503
abducts a little
girl and here I am.

336
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:19,161
100 feet away.
Might as well be in Siberia.

337
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:20,732
That's all right.

338
00:27:20,785 --> 00:27:23,171
They don't pay us enough
to be where the action is.

339
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:24,672
What are you gonna do, anyway?

340
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:26,172
What do you mean?
I just wanna help.

341
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:28,501
You wanna help?
Help me get more tape.

342
00:27:32,747 --> 00:27:34,516
What do you think--
C.I.A. or F.B.I.?

343
00:27:34,557 --> 00:27:36,533
Nah, she's dressed
too nice for F.B.I.

344
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:38,923
I saw the test scores
got posted this morning.

345
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:43,433
Don't worry about it, man.
Not everybody's a test taker.

346
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:51,761
Please don't hurt me.

347
00:28:28,187 --> 00:28:30,640
You know, we don't have any
idea what happened in here.

348
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:33,491
- I've got a theory.
- You always do.

349
00:28:33,616 --> 00:28:35,540
This is Barstow all over again.

350
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:38,221
- It's Sylar.
- There isn't a Sylar.

351
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:41,232
Last words of a dying victim.
It didn't mean anything.

352
00:28:41,378 --> 00:28:45,091
And look at her. Must have taken
three guys to lift her up that high.

353
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:46,841
- What about the daughter?
- No sign.

354
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,870
We checked the house and surrounding,
issued an Amber Alert.

355
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:52,023
You've seen what
happened to the father.

356
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:55,901
Frozen solid, skull sawed off.
We need to find out how.

357
00:28:56,006 --> 00:28:57,971
The little girl's the priority.

358
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,331
You are not supposed
to be in here.

359
00:29:33,616 --> 00:29:34,830
It's okay.

360
00:29:35,347 --> 00:29:37,222
It's okay. You're safe now.

361
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:40,362
Look, I'm a cop.
I'm one of the good guys, okay?

362
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:43,791
He hurt my mom and dad.
Please don't hurt me.

363
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:45,632
I'm not gonna let
anybody hurt you.

364
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:48,810
No, no, no.
Come on, take my hand.

365
00:29:48,946 --> 00:29:53,470
It's okay, come on. It's okay.

366
00:29:54,637 --> 00:29:55,750
Come on.

367
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:58,632
For years, he'd been working
on a mathematical theorem

368
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,570
using human genomes and
DNA migration patterns.

369
00:30:01,948 --> 00:30:04,743
He thought he could find a
way to identify these people,

370
00:30:04,778 --> 00:30:07,771
the ones who were special.
I never believed it was possible.

371
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:11,873
We fought about it constantly.
It's the reason we grew apart.

372
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:15,762
You've reached Chandra Saresh.
Please leave a message.

373
00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:18,982
He's got messages.

374
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:21,130
Chandra, this is Emi.

375
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:23,821
You forgot to turn in your
trip sheet for last week.

376
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,052
Where is your head, man?

377
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,391
- Oh, my God, Mohinder.
- Yes?

378
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:28,183
No... the other Mohinder.
The lizard.

379
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:30,013
He's gotta be around
here somewhere.

380
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:31,663
Hi, I'm Nathan Petrelli.

381
00:30:32,036 --> 00:30:35,001
It would be an honor to represent
New York's 14th district.

382
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:38,293
When the time comes,
vote Petrelli.

383
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:42,273
Hello, Chandra.
Why won't you talk to me?

384
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:44,140
You can't leave me like this.

385
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:47,941
Hello, Mr. Sylar.
I asked you not to call here anymore.

386
00:30:48,268 --> 00:30:52,273
The hunger, it's--
I can't control it.

387
00:30:52,838 --> 00:30:56,272
I don't want to.
You made me this way.

388
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:58,382
I made you a murderer?

389
00:30:58,477 --> 00:31:01,153
You helped me to
discover my potential.

390
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:04,580
You wanted to see what I
could do as much as I did.

391
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:07,641
And now you want it to stop.

392
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:10,740
It's over. Goodbye.

393
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:15,651
I found a tape of a conversation my
father had with a man named Sylar.

394
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:18,183
A man he believed
was Patient Zero.

395
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,063
Come here, you.

396
00:31:28,295 --> 00:31:32,491
Mohinder, this is Mohinder.
You wanna give him a kiss?

397
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:39,493
What is it?

398
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,002
It's a portable hard drive.

399
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:54,781
My God, he did it.

400
00:31:55,158 --> 00:31:57,883
He actually came up with
a way to find them.

401
00:31:58,297 --> 00:32:00,521
You wondered why someone
would want to kill my father.

402
00:32:00,557 --> 00:32:02,901
The reason for his death.
It's this!

403
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:08,121
I'm going to finish
what he started.

404
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:14,433
Hey, Parkman.

405
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:17,173
How the hell did you know that
little girl was in there?

406
00:32:17,206 --> 00:32:18,090
I don't know.

407
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:21,903
I don't know, I just--
I heard her whispering, and, um...

408
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:26,092
House full of cops, but you're outside,
and you just heard her whisper?

409
00:32:28,265 --> 00:32:29,901
I can't explain it. It was...

410
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:34,640
I thought everybody could hear her.
You guys couldn't hear her?

411
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:37,263
You got someplace better to be?

412
00:32:38,645 --> 00:32:41,543
It's my wife. I'm, uh...
I'm meeting her at a...

413
00:32:43,448 --> 00:32:46,031
a therapy session.
Couples counseling.

414
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:48,193
We're having some
problems at home.

415
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:52,180
This guy's
worthless. Worthless...

416
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:55,152
Cut him loose. He got lucky.

417
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,140
Not yet, Parkman.

418
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:06,721
Your captain says you've taken the
exam to advance to detective 3 times?

419
00:33:06,815 --> 00:33:07,420
Right.

420
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:09,862
You really think you're
detective material?

421
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,173
Yes, ma'am, I do.

422
00:33:11,317 --> 00:33:15,030
So how does it make you feel?
Flunking out so many times.

423
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,970
I don't know. Embarrassed, I guess.
A little angry.

424
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:22,372
- A little angry?
- Yeah.

425
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:24,413
Angry enough to do
something about it?

426
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:26,280
Maybe set yourself up
to look like a hero?

427
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:28,303
Wait, what,
you think I killed these people?

428
00:33:28,337 --> 00:33:30,332
I didn't kill these people.
Sylar did.

429
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,563
How did you know that name?

430
00:33:32,756 --> 00:33:34,580
How did you know that name?

431
00:33:37,318 --> 00:33:40,183
Six people assigned to this
case know the name of Sylar.

432
00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:42,720
How the hell did you know that?

433
00:33:43,517 --> 00:33:44,490
I heard it.

434
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:48,772
From you.

435
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,020
Like you heard
the girl whisper.

436
00:33:52,185 --> 00:33:53,070
Yeah.

437
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:55,561
Then hear this one.
You're under arrest.

438
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:57,531
What? Ow!

439
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:39,463
- Claire Bear!
- Hi, Dad.

440
00:35:39,748 --> 00:35:41,571
Hey. How was school?

441
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,733
Very school-like. How was work?

442
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:46,792
Very work-like.
Listen, I, um...

443
00:35:46,935 --> 00:35:49,041
I made a couple of calls today.

444
00:35:53,446 --> 00:35:56,780
I spoke to a very nice woman
at the adoption agency.

445
00:35:56,925 --> 00:36:00,603
And she said they were going
to try to get in touch...

446
00:36:01,065 --> 00:36:03,880
with your birth parents.
And, uh...

447
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:06,232
and request a meeting.

448
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,133
I thought that was
an adult decision.

449
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,611
You seemed pretty adult

450
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:12,602
this morning when you told
me you wanted to do it.

451
00:36:12,785 --> 00:36:13,443
Thanks.

452
00:36:14,415 --> 00:36:16,482
She said it was a
lengthy process.

453
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:18,263
And it could take weeks.

454
00:36:18,406 --> 00:36:20,652
I'm hoping... years.

455
00:36:20,756 --> 00:36:24,991
That way, you'll be my little
girl for a while longer.

456
00:36:25,827 --> 00:36:28,833
I'm not done protecting
you from the world.

457
00:36:29,678 --> 00:36:31,782
You're my dad.

458
00:36:32,805 --> 00:36:37,093
You'll never not be my dad.
I promise I'll...

459
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:40,850
be your little girl
for as long as I can.

460
00:36:42,385 --> 00:36:45,163
But you can't
protect me forever.

461
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:48,480
I know.

462
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:51,790
And it breaks my heart.

463
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:55,933
I love you, Dad.

464
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:58,281
I love you too, sweetheart.

465
00:37:00,787 --> 00:37:02,751
Go get ready for dinner.

466
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:21,712
This is Claire Bennett.

467
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:24,203
And that was
attempt number six.

468
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:27,153
It really does break my heart.

469
00:37:43,515 --> 00:37:45,471
I've been looking
all over for you.

470
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:47,960
Did you know about
Dad's depression?

471
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:50,283
Yeah.

472
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:56,292
Why didn't you ever tell me?

473
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:59,160
Because everyone's entitled
to their secrets, Peter.

474
00:38:05,877 --> 00:38:08,870
I was so sure when it happened.
Now it turns out I'm just...

475
00:38:08,926 --> 00:38:09,863
going crazy.

476
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:13,380
Look, hey...
We've been through this before.

477
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:15,162
We've played this game, okay?

478
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:19,161
Let's just... let's just go.

479
00:38:19,307 --> 00:38:21,320
Tell me what happened, Nathan.

480
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,521
When I jumped.
Tell me you flew.

481
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:28,933
I wanna hear you
say that you flew.

482
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:33,100
Tell me, or I'll jump again.

483
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:36,832
Hey, good luck on
your campaign...

484
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:39,420
when I'm splattered all
over the ground below.

485
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,161
All right.

486
00:38:46,476 --> 00:38:48,210
You want the truth?

487
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:49,662
Yeah.

488
00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:57,312
We both flew. Pete...

489
00:38:57,455 --> 00:39:00,891
I caught you, and I lost control.
You're too heavy.

490
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:04,171
We both started falling to the ground.
And just before we--

491
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:10,391
Just before we hit,
you flew. You.

492
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:12,901
Are you lying to me?

493
00:39:14,295 --> 00:39:18,810
You are. You're trying to tell
me what you think I wanna hear.

494
00:39:18,906 --> 00:39:21,023
You're lying to me again!

495
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:40,093
Did you see that?
Did you see that? I flew?

496
00:39:40,326 --> 00:39:42,050
Yeah, I know.

497
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:59,551
You're one sick son of a bitch,
you know that?

498
00:39:59,695 --> 00:40:03,171
Very sorry.
I not speak much English.

499
00:40:03,315 --> 00:40:06,060
What I wanna know is what did
you do with the man's brain?

500
00:40:06,098 --> 00:40:08,032
You flush it down the toilet,
you eat it, what?

501
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:09,422
We got a live one here.

502
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:12,672
No English, no passport,
no American money, no I.D.

503
00:40:12,805 --> 00:40:13,882
Except for this here.

504
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:17,880
"An honorary member of the
Merry Marvel Marching Society."

505
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:20,803
Let's start by asking him
how he got to New York.

506
00:40:26,348 --> 00:40:28,691
He says he teleported
himself here.

507
00:40:28,837 --> 00:40:31,092
Teleported? What
the hell is that?

508
00:40:31,188 --> 00:40:32,442
Like Star Trek.

509
00:40:32,635 --> 00:40:34,931
He says he can bend the
space-time continuum.

510
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,821
Funny, I've seen
all the Star Treks.

511
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:38,781
I don't remember
you from the show.

512
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,260
How long ago did he do this?

513
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,470
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday.

514
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:49,430
If you let me make a pone call

515
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:53,333
my English speaking friend
will clear everything up.

516
00:40:58,426 --> 00:40:59,503
Hiro?

517
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,552
New York! Teleport--

518
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:13,102
Your friend says he
was with you yesterday.

519
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:15,161
- Yesterday?
- That's not correct?

520
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,360
I have not seen Hiro
Nakamura in five weeks.

521
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:20,290
We look for him everywhere.

522
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:22,520
His buddy hasn't seen
him for five weeks.

523
00:41:23,086 --> 00:41:26,142
Your friend says
he hasn't seen you

524
00:41:26,606 --> 00:41:27,872
in five weeks.

525
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:34,830
- October 2?
- October 2? No, pal.

526
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:36,883
Today.

527
00:41:38,546 --> 00:41:40,332
November 8th.

528
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:43,140
November? No... October.

529
00:41:59,806 --> 00:42:02,062
For all his bluster,

530
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:06,251
it is the sad province of Man that
he cannot choose his triumph.

531
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:11,292
He can only choose how he will stand
when the call of destiny comes.

532
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:14,711
Hoping that he'll have
the courage to answer.
