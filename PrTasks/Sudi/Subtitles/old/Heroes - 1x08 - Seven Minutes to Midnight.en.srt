1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:03,003
Previously on Heroes

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,589
Ordinary people
across the globe

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:08,008
discover extraordinary
abilities.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,636
And their destiny is
bringing them together.

5
00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:12,471
- Dad!
- Hiro!

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,434
The cop who can hear thoughts

7
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,562
uncovers a mystery he
didn't want to solve.

8
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,232
There's something that
we need to talk about.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,942
I thought I'd been so careful.

10
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:28,150
Oh, God, he knows about the affair,
the affair, the affair...

11
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:32,571
And an extraordinary
new hero is discovered.

12
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:34,921
- Hey, let her go.
- You let her go or I shoot.

13
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:38,460
Do you have any idea what would happen
if you did that? Because I don't.

14
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:41,160
As an artist paints
the impossible...

15
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:43,283
Look around you at
all these paintings!

16
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:45,080
Every one of them
has come true.

17
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:47,461
... the face of
evil is after him.

18
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:49,920
- Bring him in.
- Isaac Mendez?

19
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:54,173
And a son turns his back on
his father's search for heroes.

20
00:00:54,427 --> 00:00:57,971
My father's ashes. I'm no closer to
understanding my father's research.

21
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,350
And now, Heroes continues.

22
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:04,643
The earth is large.

23
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:07,940
Large enough that you think
you can hide from anything.

24
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:08,941
From fate.

25
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:10,650
From God.

26
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,493
If only you found a
place far enough away.

27
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:15,360
So you run.

28
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:29,041
To the edge of the earth.

29
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:35,263
Where all is safe again, quiet and warm.
Chapter 8 - Seven Minutes to Midnight

30
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,303
The solace of salt air.

31
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:44,222
The peace of danger
left behind.

32
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,611
The luxury of grief.

33
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:59,033
And maybe for a moment...

34
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:02,621
you believe you have escaped.

35
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,581
Mohinder.

36
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,213
You mustn't look
back, Mohinder.

37
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:16,763
Your father's moved
on to the next life.

38
00:02:31,946 --> 00:02:33,771
Welcome back.

39
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,030
I thought I'd clean
you up a little bit.

40
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:42,870
You've had a rough couple of days,
but you're doing great.

41
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:49,210
You'll be completely
clean in no time.

42
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:53,092
And you're sure I'll
still be able to... paint?

43
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:55,552
After I teach you, yes.

44
00:02:55,925 --> 00:03:00,130
The drugs were just a facilitator.
We're gonna help you, Isaac.

45
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,430
That mural on the floor?

46
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:05,391
We're not gonna
let that happen.

47
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,022
You seem pretty sure.

48
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:12,350
I am pretty sure.

49
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,731
- Because...
- Because I went through
the same thing myself.

50
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,953
All right.

51
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,620
You need anything
else, Sheriff?

52
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,620
- Lloyd?
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,751
Gun to shoot Will Shortz.

54
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:16,291
- Let me see.
- Ghandi burial ground, 11 letters.

55
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:17,632
Something...

56
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:21,551
- Ganges, maybe?
- Mm, Kanyakumari.

57
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:27,302
K-A-N-Y-A, and then you
got the rest right there.

58
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,552
How the hell did you
know that, Charlie?

59
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:31,521
That one of the
stops on your trip?

60
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,522
Oh, trip around
the world's pricey.

61
00:04:33,777 --> 00:04:36,471
Right now, I can only make
it as far as Oklahoma City.

62
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:41,493
- Who won the Academy Award
for best actor in 1981?
- She's not Google, Lloyd.

63
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:43,820
Henry Fonda. On Golden Pond.

64
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,290
You know,
I preferred Dudley Moore in Arthur,

65
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:50,820
but if you really wanna test me, you
oughta ask me if I remember your credit
card numbers.

66
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:59,043
No wonder everyone in
America is so fat...

67
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:00,503
all there is to eat

68
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:02,882
is waffles and French fries.

69
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,471
You like French fries.

70
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:07,852
I gained four kilos
from French fries.

71
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:10,103
We need our strength.

72
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,980
Soon we'll meet Peter
Petrelli and help him

73
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:15,313
save the Cheerleader's life.

74
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:16,692
It is...

75
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:18,771
our MISSION.

76
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,443
Hey, anything
looking good, guys?

77
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:26,612
Everyseeng good o-looking.

78
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,783
Wow. You two are a
long way from home.

79
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:32,082
We don't get a lot of
tourists out here.

80
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,790
Turisto? How you
know we turisto?

81
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:37,001
It's just a guess.

82
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:38,880
What's that on your jacket?

83
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:41,670
Bachigai. That means,

84
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:44,351
- "I don't belong here," right?
- You know Japanese?

85
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:45,630
Well, I got this

86
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:48,311
Japanese phrase book for my
birthday about six months ago,

87
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:49,980
and I started poking
through it last week.

88
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,560
Um... "One Bento Box...

89
00:05:51,688 --> 00:05:53,270
with shrimp, please."

90
00:05:56,945 --> 00:05:58,940
I'm still learning.

91
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:00,483
Tokyo...

92
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,482
is going to be

93
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:05,073
the third stop on
my trip someday.

94
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,163
You learned all that from
a book in just one week?

95
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:11,491
- Very good memory!
- Yeah, I remember lots and lots.

96
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,382
It's just something that my
brain started doing lately.

97
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,291
Whether I want it to or not.

98
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:19,462
- Um... so what'll it be?
- You pick.

99
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:22,843
Someseeng  delicious for me.

100
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:28,432
And, uh, for my friend,
he needs food for fatto, fatto.

101
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:29,892
Okay.

102
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:31,681
Well, I got just the thing.

103
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,971
One chilaquiles, and one cottage
cheese plate coming right up.

104
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,731
Who says no one in
America is nice.

105
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:19,851
Please tell me you're not
going back there again.

106
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:23,861
There are no answers for me there.
I belong here.

107
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:25,861
I'm glad to hear you say that.

108
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:28,193
You think I was a fool to go.

109
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,280
I think you had to.

110
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:33,950
It's an odd country, America.

111
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,082
Everyone  there seems so lonely.

112
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:37,870
Including me.

113
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:41,121
I'm not sure what I
accomplished by going there.

114
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:43,961
Only seeing things I
wish I'd never had.

115
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:52,473
Mira came to pay her respects
to your father, Mohinder.

116
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:57,971
Maybe there's more waiting here for
you than just your professorship.

117
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:05,313
The new semester begins...
on Monday.

118
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:09,031
I didn't cancel your classes.

119
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:12,052
You can move into your
father's old office, Mohinder.

120
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:13,450
Thank you.

121
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:18,801
Mira.

122
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:21,852
I wasn't sure you'd speak
to me at the funeral.

123
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:25,601
I didn't want to take that chance,
so I left.

124
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,311
I won't lie to you.

125
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:29,273
I was surprised
to see you there.

126
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:33,403
- Or anywhere, for that matter.
- I said some terrible things to you.

127
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,032
About your father,
about his theories.

128
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,572
But now that he's dead,
I feel...

129
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:43,160
- What's done is done.
- Is it?

130
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,821
Your mother tells me you're
not returning to New York.

131
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:50,040
New semester starts next week.
My life is here.

132
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,511
I've been promoted
at the company.

133
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,680
Head of all genetic research.
Can you imagine?

134
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:03,560
- Good for you.
- No, good for you.

135
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:08,310
It's the sort of cutting-edge
science we used to talk about
late into the night.

136
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:13,652
The world's worst pillow talk,
I'd say.

137
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:19,202
I was hoping I could convince you to
come in for an interview with
the partners.

138
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:22,450
Only I'd have to know
that your father's work,

139
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,793
all of his theories,
would stay right where they are.

140
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,923
Packed away in that box.

141
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:30,541
I don't expect an
answer right now.

142
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:33,131
But you will think about it,
won't you?

143
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,920
Yes.

144
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:43,851
We didn't say hello.

145
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,931
Hello, Mira.

146
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:48,640
Hello, Mohinder.

147
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:58,241
I need you to handle this.

148
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:00,240
I'll give you one hour.

149
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,221
- You're an idiot, Parkman,
do you know that?
- Wow, good morning to you, too.

150
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:09,053
You think I wouldn't find out about
you assaulting a fellow officer?

151
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,893
I didn't assault him.
I... I just hit him.

152
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:14,683
This is why I don't like needing people.
Nine times out of ten, they let you down.

153
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:16,771
- Wow, that's an optimistic view
of the world.
- Just an observation.

154
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:19,601
- And how'd this get to be about you?
- Because it was a stupid rookie move,

155
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,812
and you could've jeopardized
my investigation.

156
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,512
How serious is this?

157
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,523
- Are you getting suspended?
- I'll work it out.

158
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,640
Did he deserve it?

159
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,943
Y eah.

160
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,061
Yeah, he deserved it.

161
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,661
- Is he talking?
- Nope.

162
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:48,513
And he's got one hour before Homeland
Security sends him down the rabbit hole
as a suspected terrorist.

163
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:50,912
Terrorist? We both know
he's not a terrorist.

164
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:53,631
- His wife was dying. He lost control.
- Of what?

165
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:59,091
This guy puts out 1,800 curies of
radiation without ever coming
in contact with nuclear material.

166
00:11:59,306 --> 00:12:01,270
We still don't know
how that's possible.

167
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:04,391
You know, three months ago,
my job made perfect sense to me.

168
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:06,641
And then I pulled
the Sylar case.

169
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:08,630
Crime scenes with
no fingerprints.

170
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,312
Bodies frozen, brains removed.

171
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:12,810
And now this guy.

172
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:14,442
That's two people wh...

173
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:18,690
Make that three people who can
do things I just can't explain.

174
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:22,672
- What're you saying,
you think I'm like them?
- I don't know what I think.

175
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:25,053
But if we're gonna find Sylar,
I need answers.

176
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,451
I have no idea
how this happened.

177
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,160
Well, then,
I guess that just leaves Ted here.

178
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:34,172
- What's this?
- Detects radiation levels.

179
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:36,792
As long as that's dark green,
we're good.

180
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:40,713
- Oh... Okay, what's the bad color?
- Not green.

181
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,721
"The dance floor...

182
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,842
lights are cool."

183
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:47,351
Perfecto!

184
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:49,522
You ready for disco.

185
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,680
- I got it right?
- Almost.

186
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:55,690
Well, don't let
me off easy, now.

187
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:00,982
Okay.

188
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:10,162
"I don't like this song...

189
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,162
let's get a drink."

190
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:16,420
You learn very fast.

191
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:19,593
Yeah, lately,
I sorta remember everything I read.

192
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:24,170
- It's kind of a skill, I guess.
- My skill much more complicate.

193
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:27,262
Oh, yeah? What can you do?

194
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,522
I can teach Japanese to anyone.

195
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:45,240
You're sweet.

196
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:55,332
Sweet means nice. Cute.

197
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,631
That's not in book.

198
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:00,380
No.

199
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,091
It is just true.

200
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,890
I like the way your cheeks
wobble when you concentrate.

201
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,433
Yeah.

202
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:16,481
Oh, oh, sorry.
Someone's Denver omelet's up.

203
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:19,313
"I'll be right back." Here?

204
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:23,651
I'm sweet!

205
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,850
They won't even let me
go to my wife's funeral.

206
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:41,132
All I wanted was
to be left alone.

207
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,940
We need you to answer
a few more questions.

208
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:47,130
You can't get your partner
here to look inside my head?

209
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,823
We need to have
it on the record.

210
00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:50,842
You burnt that
doctor to the bone.

211
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:54,180
Probably gave your wife cancer.
How'd you do it?

212
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:55,642
Ted.

213
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:58,662
Ted, if you don't let us help you,
they're gonna take you away,

214
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,482
- and nobody'll listen to you.
- It doesn't matter.

215
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:03,573
Nothing matters.

216
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:06,320
I killed my wife!

217
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:13,280
- Audrey.
- You know, just lock me up.

218
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,122
Execute me.

219
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,833
- Leave me the hell alone!
- I wish we could, Ted.

220
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:20,551
Look, I don't know anything
about any nuclear material!

221
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,381
Ted, Ted! You know what?
Just relax.

222
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:24,471
Do you want me to be
the terrorist, huh?

223
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,640
Do you want me to be the bad guy?
Fine, I'll blow this place apart.

224
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,343
- Ted!
- Ted.

225
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,053
S top!

226
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,103
- Ted!
- Just stop!

227
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,012
- Do it.
- Ted.

228
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,272
Do it!

229
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,640
Do it!

230
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:39,910
- Ted, I know what you're going through.
- Yeah, sure, you do.

231
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:41,191
Yeah, like hell you do.

232
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:42,952
Come on, Ted!
You've seen what I can do.

233
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,571
Okay?

234
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:46,653
Something is
happening to me, too.

235
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:49,863
Ted, I was able to read
your wife's dying thoughts.

236
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,532
We're just trying to
understand what it is. Ted.

237
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:53,871
Come on, Ted. Relax.

238
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,082
Come on. Just take me back.

239
00:15:57,376 --> 00:16:00,870
Take me back to...
to when this all started, okay?

240
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,712
Just... start from
the beginning. Good.

241
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,752
Blacked  out.

242
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:09,972
And when I woke up,
everything started dying.

243
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,512
You blacked out.

244
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:17,063
How long were you out for?
Were you drinking?

245
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:23,352
When you came to,
did you have bruises on your arms?

246
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:27,022
I'll do you one better.

247
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,493
What's the matter, Parkman?

248
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,083
- I'm going.
- Don't walk away.

249
00:17:27,388 --> 00:17:30,183
It doesn't matter what you think.
I'm not asking your opinion.

250
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,353
Yes. How could I have forgotten...
You never have before.

251
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,882
- Why should now be any different?
- It is my life!

252
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:36,470
I'm going, and that's final.

253
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,651
Has it never occurred to you that your
actions could affect anyone else?

254
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:42,322
- I don't have time
for anyone else's feelings.
- Clearly!

255
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:45,072
The world needs to know about my
findings. That's all that's important.

256
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:48,610
The world doesn't care.
No one at the university cares.

257
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:52,992
You're becoming a laughing stock.
I can't cover for you any longer.

258
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,872
- I'm not asking you to.
- How will you support yourself?

259
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,793
- What will you do for money?
- Oh, I'll get by.

260
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,172
How? Do you know what doctors
do in the United States?

261
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:01,910
They drive taxi cabs.

262
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,182
It is one thing to publish a book
in the comfort of the university.

263
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,640
It is another to leave everything
behind... your wife, your family,
your job...

264
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:10,570
chasing a theory that
is pure fantasy.

265
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,500
It's a fool's errand.

266
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:19,682
We'll see who will be the fool,
won't we?

267
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:24,102
Yes, I guess we will.

268
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:40,247
Mohinder is right.

269
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:45,081
- I am abandoning my family, my job.
- You are.

270
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:48,582
But  I know you, Chandra,
better than you know yourself.

271
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,542
You will not stop thinking
of this if you don't go.

272
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:55,800
It will consume you and,
eventually, all of us with it.

273
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,550
- He'll hate me for it.
- I'm not sure that he doesn't already.

274
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:07,563
- I should try to stay for his sake.
- Why?

275
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:13,570
He will never take her place in your
eyes. That has always been the case.

276
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,670
Who are you?

277
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:35,630
What do you want?

278
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,583
I was in, uh,
Kansas a couple months back.

279
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,082
I'd just made a big sale to
the university hospital.

280
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:12,252
Dialysis machines.

281
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,382
Commission was gonna give
Karen and me enough money to...

282
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:25,433
I-I went to the,
uh, the hotel bar.

283
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,473
Buy everybody a few rounds.

284
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,032
There weren't many
people there.

285
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:30,601
A couple from Wyoming.

286
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:32,350
Some professors.

287
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,402
A student from, uh, Haiti.

288
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:40,401
The next thing I-I know,
I'm waking up in my car.

289
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:45,411
It's two days later,
and I'm in Tempe, Arizona.

290
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:48,702
These weird cuts and
bruises all over me.

291
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,962
A couple of days later,
I start to notice things.

292
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,861
- I'd buy my wife flowers, and they'd wilt.
- Okay, what about your health?

293
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,101
I mean, were you sick?
Do you have headaches?

294
00:20:58,138 --> 00:21:00,213
Yeah. Headaches.

295
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:01,973
But, uh...

296
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,180
Karen.

297
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:10,473
- The doctor said she had
radiation poisoning.
- From you?

298
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,392
I was killing her.

299
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,403
Are there any other bodies
out there we don't know about?

300
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:17,152
I'm just saying.

301
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,571
This is not his fault.
He's just trying to figure this out.

302
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:24,612
Look, the same thing
happened to me.

303
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:27,122
Okay, I blacked out.
I lost two days.

304
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:29,630
- You should've told me about this.
- I should've done a lot of things.

305
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,540
Up until now, I haven't told anyone.
Not even my wife.

306
00:21:32,757 --> 00:21:34,893
And now I can't stop
hearing people's thoughts.

307
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,332
It's painful.

308
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:39,393
- I'm hearing things that
I should not be hearing.
- Like what?

309
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:41,051
Things that could ruin lives.

310
00:21:41,346 --> 00:21:45,092
Things that...
could end marriages.

311
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:54,641
The guy that you described,
the student. He was, uh, Haitian.

312
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,943
- Big guy? Bald?
- Yeah, yeah.

313
00:21:58,157 --> 00:22:00,493
I'm telling you,
I think I saw this guy right before...

314
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,503
- right before I blacked out, too.
- What are you guys talking about?

315
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:05,071
A Haitian guy?

316
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:07,503
These things that we can do,
th--they're not normal.

317
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,453
We were cut.
W-we were injected.

318
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,791
- Blacked out, who knows
what they did to us?
- Or how they changed us.

319
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:15,870
- Time's up.
- What?

320
00:22:15,915 --> 00:22:18,511
Just a couple more minutes.
And you, you shouldn't even be here.

321
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,173
Your badge has been suspended.

322
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:23,311
- Did he tell you where
the nuclear material is?
- Move it.

323
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:24,592
He's coming with me.

324
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,783
- What? No, you can't take him right now.
- Yeah, they can.

325
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:33,020
Find the Haitian. Find him!

326
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:38,592
- You gotta get him back in here.
- I can't.

327
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,620
What do you mean you can't?
You heard what he said.

328
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:43,043
He's gonna help me figure
out what happened to me.

329
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:45,412
- Why did you lie to me
about being suspended?
- Okay, so I left that part out.

330
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:47,620
But  you have come to me
and asked for my help.

331
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,543
And I come running to you every single
time. So now I'm asking for your help.

332
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:52,052
All right, get him back in here,
so I can talk to him!

333
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:55,792
I'm sorry.
It's out of my hands.

334
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:13,723
That's good.

335
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,093
- Mr. Bennet.
- Rufus.

336
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:19,193
Ooh, I-I got next
month's parking sticker.

337
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,062
Just need you to sign for it.

338
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,110
I'll take care of
that later, Rufus.

339
00:23:25,158 --> 00:23:27,240
Ooh, sorry, sorry.

340
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:10,900
- How's he doing?
- Heroin's out of his system.

341
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,800
His body doesn't want it anymore,
but his mind still does.

342
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:15,781
- Coherent?
- Very.

343
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,370
You ready to meet him?

344
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:22,543
Yeah.

345
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:31,971
Isaac.

346
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:35,553
This is Mr.
Bennet, the man I told you about.

347
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:37,931
Hello, Isaac.

348
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:42,143
Drawing anything interesting?

349
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,232
- It's nothing.
- Oh, you know that's not true.

350
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:52,863
You have the ability to paint
the future. That's something.

351
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,820
Something very important.

352
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:58,992
- Feels like a curse.
- No, it's a blessing.

353
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:01,543
Don't let anybody
tell you differently.

354
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:06,173
We're gonna help
you understand that.

355
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:08,250
I'm grateful you're helping me.

356
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:11,512
I'm just not sure
why you're doing it.

357
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:14,383
To be 100% honest with you...

358
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:17,642
I need your help.

359
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:22,851
How we doin'?

360
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:26,732
- Good.
- Okay.

361
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:24,203
Oh, my God!

362
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,093
Charlie...

363
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:39,762
She's dead.

364
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:57,570
I know you miss him.

365
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:00,320
And I know you
feel guilty, too.

366
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:03,741
- Don't.
- I had a dream last night.

367
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:07,873
You and father were talking before he
left. In it, you persuaded him to go.

368
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:10,550
- It was just a dream, Mohinder.
- No, I need to know if it was true.

369
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,711
Come.

370
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:18,801
Your father and I were
married for 33 years.

371
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:21,071
- That is not an answer.
- Yes, it is.

372
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:25,362
A marriage doesn't last that long
without allowing the other person to be
who he has to be.

373
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:29,853
But how could you allow him to
abandon everything? Just like that.

374
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:33,650
I'm afraid that answer
is not as easy.

375
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:39,530
In the dream, you said that I
could never take the place of her.

376
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,873
Who did you mean?

377
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:50,041
I suppose it's time that you knew,
now that your father's gone.

378
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:52,540
Mohinder...

379
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:56,093
You had a sister.

380
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:59,171
A sister?

381
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:03,470
Her name was Shanti.

382
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:08,310
And sh--she was five years old when she
died, two years after you were born.

383
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:10,352
Well, why didn't I know this?

384
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:16,152
Because it was too painful to talk
about, especially for your father.

385
00:28:16,408 --> 00:28:21,660
He loved her so much, he was afraid
that you would compare his love.

386
00:28:21,957 --> 00:28:24,623
From the moment she was born,

387
00:28:24,915 --> 00:28:27,662
he was convinced that
she was special.

388
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:33,461
And she was special.

389
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:39,511
These dates.

390
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,470
Suicide bomber, 15 people dead.

391
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:44,263
Train derailment, 9 dead.

392
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,563
Earthquake, 81.

393
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:50,312
This girl,
the one you've painted here,

394
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:53,690
and here, and there...

395
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:56,653
she's my daughter.

396
00:28:57,328 --> 00:28:59,070
My Claire.

397
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:02,070
This man here...

398
00:29:02,328 --> 00:29:04,532
goes by the name of Sylar.

399
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:07,551
He's gonna kill her tomorrow
night at her homecoming game.

400
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:09,660
- Why?
- Because she's special.

401
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:12,580
Like you.
And that makes her a target.

402
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:15,960
- Like me.
- You're not the only one
with special abilities, Isaac.

403
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,461
There are others.
Sylar is killing them.

404
00:29:18,678 --> 00:29:21,340
One at a time.

405
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:24,681
If you know who he is,
then why can't you stop him?

406
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:28,220
Because nobody knows where he is.
I need your help.

407
00:29:28,478 --> 00:29:31,312
I need you to paint
this painting.

408
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:33,893
I'm sorry.
I've been trying. I can't.

409
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:36,810
Not without the drugs.

410
00:29:37,697 --> 00:29:39,482
Fine.

411
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:56,121
I promise we will help you use your
abilities without this, but right now,
there just isn't time.

412
00:29:56,467 --> 00:30:00,063
I'm fighting to get my life back,
and you want me to just throw it away.

413
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,592
You know...

414
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:10,760
For many years now,
a number of us have been

415
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:14,733
tracking, locating,
monitoring people like you.

416
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:18,653
Sometimes the process goes smoothly,
as in your case, and other times...

417
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:22,370
Well, let's just say some people
misinterpret our motives,
and then it can go...

418
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:24,362
very wrong.

419
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:26,493
14 years ago,

420
00:30:26,707 --> 00:30:28,783
there was just such a case,

421
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,042
which, sadly, ended in a death.

422
00:30:32,378 --> 00:30:36,870
The woman left behind a baby girl
who had no one to take care of her.

423
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:40,003
My wife and I had been
having a hard time...

424
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:43,960
conceiving a child of
our own at the time.

425
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:48,013
And... and it was like...

426
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:52,392
God had reached down
and given us a miracle.

427
00:30:54,356 --> 00:30:56,350
Isaac.

428
00:30:57,777 --> 00:31:01,403
This is my daughter
we're talking about.

429
00:31:02,658 --> 00:31:04,480
I'm begging you.

430
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,202
Let me try one more time.

431
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,043
Without it.

432
00:31:31,648 --> 00:31:33,392
Who are you?

433
00:31:37,026 --> 00:31:38,811
What are you doing here?

434
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,443
Hey, wait!

435
00:31:44,617 --> 00:31:46,443
Stop! Come back here.

436
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:57,203
I have a pickup at 59th
and Broadway to JFK.

437
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:02,751
No!

438
00:32:03,596 --> 00:32:05,800
Father!

439
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,883
Father!

440
00:32:09,807 --> 00:32:10,630
Fath...

441
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,143
Father!

442
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:16,722
Stop!

443
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:22,270
Stop. Stop, stop.

444
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:27,380
Dad?

445
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,211
Claire?

446
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:33,351
- Honey, is everything all right?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

447
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:35,393
Can't a girl just
visit her dad at work?

448
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:38,261
- You never visit me at work.
- Okay. I'm busted.

449
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:39,972
I have an emergency.

450
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,223
- A paper emergency.
- A paper emergency.

451
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:45,701
A paper emergency. Ms. Roberts says we
need a banner over the trophy case,

452
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:49,292
and Jackie was all,
"We don't have paper that big.
They don't make paper that big."

453
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:52,612
So I thought I'd stop by
and try to be a hero.

454
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:58,050
Well, if it'll make you a hero and
maybe knock Jackie down a few notches,

455
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,660
- we might be able to find
something that'll work.
- Best dad ever.

456
00:34:04,838 --> 00:34:06,830
I'm sorry, Mr. Bennet.

457
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,420
We just have a
little situation.

458
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:14,270
You know what? The sample room is
right down there, Claire-bear.

459
00:34:14,307 --> 00:34:17,220
- You take anything you need. Okay?
- Thanks, Dad.

460
00:34:17,938 --> 00:34:19,811
First door on your left.

461
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,172
I'm sorry.
I didn't know she'd be here.

462
00:34:23,236 --> 00:34:24,733
So what's the problem?

463
00:34:25,025 --> 00:34:27,191
It's not working.
He can't do it.

464
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,780
He tried.
He's just not there yet.

465
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:34,072
We tried his way.
Now we do it mine.

466
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:37,173
He has worked so hard to get clean.
You can't ask him to do this.

467
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,740
I'm not going to ask him.

468
00:34:39,837 --> 00:34:41,292
You are.

469
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:45,501
No! No,
you can't make me do that.

470
00:34:45,588 --> 00:34:47,462
You knew this was
a possibility.

471
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:50,922
You said when we started that I
would never have to do it again.

472
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:53,102
- You promised me.
- I know what you think.

473
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:54,763
Who do you think taught you?

474
00:34:55,098 --> 00:34:58,302
Do you even remember what
you were when I found you?

475
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:04,432
You're the easy way.

476
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:08,770
I think we both
know the hard way.

477
00:36:04,415 --> 00:36:08,043
Did she say anything?
Sounded like she was scared?

478
00:36:08,915 --> 00:36:13,131
- No. She seemed very nice.
- She was.

479
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:16,553
Too nice... to die like that.

480
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:18,673
Head ripped open.

481
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:23,303
I ain't never seen
anything like it.

482
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:30,233
- We're very sorry.
- Y'all stick around.

483
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:32,402
Need to take your statements.

484
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,692
She was killed...

485
00:36:38,075 --> 00:36:39,362
same way as

486
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:43,320
the painter, Isaac,
when I saw him in the future.

487
00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:45,832
That can't be a coincidence.

488
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:49,711
Then we should be
extra careful.

489
00:36:49,965 --> 00:36:52,083
There has to be
something I can do.

490
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:54,751
She's already dead.

491
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:56,843
I can bend time.

492
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,421
I can go back.

493
00:37:00,056 --> 00:37:01,227
No--

494
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:03,513
Why else did I get
these powers...

495
00:37:03,728 --> 00:37:05,263
if I'm not supposed to help?

496
00:37:05,518 --> 00:37:07,150
We're already on one
stupid mission...

497
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:08,430
you don't need another.

498
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,950
I didn't do anything when
those poker men died.

499
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:13,073
I can't just sit back
and do nothing again--

500
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:14,150
Sure you can!

501
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:15,811
It's easy.

502
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,690
I'll just go back...

503
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,323
to yesterday.

504
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:21,782
I'll stop her from
coming to work.

505
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:23,820
If she's not here...

506
00:37:23,996 --> 00:37:25,320
she can't be killed.

507
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,081
But YOU can be!

508
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:29,832
You don't have to control
over your powers yet.

509
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,750
The last time
you tele-ported...

510
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:34,000
you ended up in the future.

511
00:37:34,178 --> 00:37:35,463
In another country!

512
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:37,561
If I'm too scared
to use my powers...

513
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,670
then I don't deserve them.

514
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:44,641
I have to try.

515
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,553
What about the Cheerleader?

516
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:47,851
I won't be late.

517
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:49,392
Just count to five...

518
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,233
and I'll be back.

519
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:53,102
We'll celebrate...

520
00:37:53,278 --> 00:37:55,063
my victory.

521
00:37:58,828 --> 00:38:00,150
Hiro?

522
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:01,782
PLEASE.

523
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:09,332
three...

524
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:10,701
four...

525
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,120
five.

526
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,960
Hiro?

527
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:37,653
- What is that? Ensenada?
- Mm.

528
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:44,493
Pam Auden called...

529
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:47,743
to ask me why you
punched Tom McHenry.

530
00:38:47,997 --> 00:38:49,660
I told her you didn't.

531
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,873
Did you?

532
00:38:52,548 --> 00:38:53,791
Yeah.

533
00:38:57,008 --> 00:39:00,003
- Yeah, I punched him.
- He knows.

534
00:39:00,175 --> 00:39:02,250
Damn it, I knew it.

535
00:39:02,555 --> 00:39:06,381
You punched a superior officer?
That has to have some kind
of repercussions.

536
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:10,100
He may outrank me, but "superior's"
taking it a little too far.

537
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:12,560
I got one month's suspension.

538
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,313
- No pay.
- Jesus, Matt.

539
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:32,202
Something happened...
between me and Tom.

540
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:37,542
You slept with him.

541
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:39,371
Yes.

542
00:39:51,478 --> 00:39:54,933
- Is it over?
- Yes.

543
00:39:58,448 --> 00:40:00,520
Are we?

544
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:04,153
I don't know.

545
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:17,291
- Yeah, it's Matt.
- He's gone.

546
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:20,000
- What?
- Ted. He escaped.

547
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:21,923
Watch out!

548
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,290
Do you hear me?

549
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:27,342
Yeah. Yeah, I heard you.

550
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:37,993
You can run far.

551
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:40,503
You can take your
small precautions.

552
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:43,041
But have you really
gotten away?

553
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:47,093
Can you ever escape?

554
00:41:56,728 --> 00:42:02,523
Or is the truth that you do not
have the strength or cunning
to hide from destiny?

555
00:42:04,695 --> 00:42:05,941
What?

556
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,692
- Nothing.
- Tsh.

557
00:42:13,328 --> 00:42:17,321
But the world is not small.
You are.

558
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:38,601
And fate can find you anywhere.

559
