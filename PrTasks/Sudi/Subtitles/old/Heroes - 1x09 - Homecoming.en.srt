1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:02,294
Previously on Heroes

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,463
Ordinary people
across the globe

3
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,924
discovered
extraordinary abilities.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,093
- A single mother lost her son...
- Mum!

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,222
... and gives in to the
dark side to save him.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,850
I did what had to be done.
Like I always do.

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,977
A new hero is discovered...

8
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,784
I remember lots and lots. It's just
something that my brain started doing.

9
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,025
... but meets a tragic fate.

10
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,480
And another hero goes back
in time to rescue her.

11
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:31,481
I'll just go back...
I'll stop her from coming to work.

12
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:35,951
Peter solves the mystery
of his destiny...

13
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:39,160
The cheerleader.
I think we're all trying to help her.

14
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:42,871
... and a father was stopping
nothing to avert catastrophy.

15
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:45,503
This girl,
the one you've painted here,

16
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:48,001
she's my daughter.
This man here...

17
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:50,521
he's gonna kill her tomorrow
night at her homecoming game.

18
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:52,552
I need you to paint
this painting.

19
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:55,632
Tonight, their destinies
will unite them,

20
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:59,893
to save the cheerleader
and save the world.

21
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,272
Chapter Nine - Homecoming

22
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:15,241
We are, if anything,

23
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:17,203
creatures of habit...

24
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:22,950
Drawn to the safety and
comfort of the familiar.

25
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,290
So do they actually believe
that pudding is a vegetable?

26
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:30,713
But what happens when the
familiar becomes unsafe?

27
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:34,133
When the fear that we have been
desperately trying to avoid

28
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:36,552
finds us where we live?

29
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:40,302
- Something wrong?
- Jackie just killed my appetite.

30
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:47,702
Oh, look, the principal's gonna post
the homecoming queen announcement.

31
00:01:47,738 --> 00:01:49,483
Whoopee.

32
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,040
Well, aren't you gonna
go see if you won?

33
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:54,621
- What's the point?
- You're a finalist, Claire. Go.

34
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:04,953
Good luck.

35
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:10,753
Kinda nervy for someone in your position
to be running for homecoming queen.

36
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,040
My position?

37
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:14,670
You know. Pariah?

38
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,921
You hospitalized the MVP,

39
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:20,552
annihilating any hope of us
actually winning the game.

40
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,931
You're not deluded enough to
think you're actually gonna win?

41
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:30,350
No delusions.
It's a popularity contest,

42
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:33,552
and you've made it very clear
that I am no longer popular.

43
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:35,450
It's more than a
popularity contest.

44
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:38,822
Being selected homecoming queen
is about serving your school.

45
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:42,281
God, Claire.
I didn't think you were that shallow.

46
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:45,128
Congratulations, ladies.
Make me proud.

47
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,660
Oh, my God,

48
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:49,291
- don't spaz out.
- What?

49
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:56,460
I can't believe it.

50
00:02:57,016 --> 00:02:58,721
I won?

51
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:05,183
Claire! Claire! Claire!

52
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:11,440
Shut up, you freaks!

53
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,612
Claire! Claire! Claire!

54
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:20,621
You didn't tell Peter about me
buying this painting, did you?

55
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,361
You asked me not to.

56
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:26,122
I don't get it. What is it?

57
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:27,583
It's one of a series,

58
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,053
the work of Isaac Mendez,
a rising artist.

59
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:32,543
Peter believes Isaac
can paint the future.

60
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:34,923
Is it supposed to be Peter?

61
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:37,170
I'm not sure.

62
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:40,261
But Peter thinks he
needs to be there

63
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:42,181
to save a cheerleader.

64
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,640
- Union Wells High School.
- Yeah.

65
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:50,600
Peter thinks if he
saves a cheerleader...

66
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:52,523
he'll save the world.

67
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:55,521
Right.

68
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:00,151
- Is that the only copy?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,150
Why?

70
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,580
Peter's got all these...

71
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:09,410
ideas in his head.

72
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:11,461
Delusions of grandeur.

73
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:15,000
He thinks he's supposed to

74
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:17,752
make a difference.

75
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:24,260
What are you doing?

76
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,510
What are you doing? No! No!

77
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:29,350
No!

78
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:32,812
Saving his life.

79
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,100
What?

80
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:36,861
You believe it?

81
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:39,941
Save the cheerleader,
save the world?

82
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:46,531
- I'm not sure what to believe anymore.
- I am.

83
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,771
Nice!

84
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:23,281
What's the range on this?

85
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:26,153
The Kinsella 320Z,

86
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,832
been known to pierce
body armor at 400 yards.

87
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:32,451
- Military grade.
- That'll work.

88
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:34,790
Don't want to see
his eyes, huh?

89
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:38,710
- Must really hate the guy.
- You have no idea.

90
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:40,171
He took my son.

91
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:41,843
Damn.

92
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:45,050
- You call the cops?
- Cops can't stop him.

93
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:49,512
but I can as long as he
doesn't see it coming.

94
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:53,561
- How much?
- Two large.

95
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,941
We're going hunting.

96
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:20,110
So how long do you plan
on keeping this up?

97
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,883
Till you turn around.

98
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:23,842
I told you, we can't go back!

99
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:25,552
And  I told you Mom needs me.

100
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:27,471
It's not safe with her.

101
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:33,103
Look...

102
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:36,600
I still love her.

103
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:40,152
No matter what she does,
a part of me always will.

104
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,651
But your mom has changed.

105
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:45,783
The good news

106
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:49,032
is that it's gonna be you
and me from here on out.

107
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:50,822
Partners.

108
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:55,910
- You mean, like Batman and Robin?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:58,460
Like Batman and Robin.

110
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:01,292
Only...

111
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:04,250
I  ain't wearing no tights.

112
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:07,380
You could wear tights.
I'm not wearing tights.

113
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,380
- Need to hit the head?
- Nah, I'm good.

114
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:39,202
Micah!

115
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:43,221
Did you ever consider that these
dreams that you've been having,

116
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:45,350
- are just that, dreams?
- It's impossible.

117
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:49,173
They were talking about my sister
Shanti, a sister I never knew I had!

118
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,523
As children,
we absorb powerful archetypes

119
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:53,341
that we bury in
our subconscious.

120
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,811
Your parents were obviously
still grieving over your sister.

121
00:07:57,107 --> 00:08:00,053
- Freud would tell you the same thing.
- What about the boy?

122
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:03,311
- The one with the soccer ball?
- Yes, how do you explain

123
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,061
his picture being hidden
in my father's desk, huh?

124
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,161
He was one of them,
right here in Chennai.

125
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:11,283
Sanjog Iyer,
my father identified the genetic marker.

126
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,432
It says the boy can
enter your dreams,

127
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:16,332
alter your perceptions,
uh,  kind of spirit guide.

128
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,971
- You must have seen that file before.
- I have never seen this file before,

129
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:22,302
and I have had thousands
of dreams in my life.

130
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,640
These were different, they were...
they were real.

131
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:26,751
We have to find this boy.

132
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:32,720
Hey, what was so important
you had me meet you over here?

133
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:35,913
That painting you wanted,
Nathan bought it from Linderman,

134
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:38,642
- had it shipped here.
- It's here... Can I see it?

135
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:41,183
There.

136
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:49,270
I-I don't understand.

137
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:51,031
He said it was to protect you,

138
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,071
that you're gonna
get yourself killed.

139
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:55,663
Okay, wait a minute.

140
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,723
You saw this painting,
all right.

141
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,423
- You can describe it to me.
- You really believe this, don't you?

142
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,130
Save the cheerleader,
save the world.

143
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:04,460
For reasons I can't
begin to understand...

144
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,381
There are people that are
counting on me to do this.

145
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,051
I don't know if I can,
but I have to try.

146
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,850
This doesn't make any sense.

147
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,192
I probably shouldn't
be showing you this.

148
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:32,613
It's a digital image,
it came with the painting.

149
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:36,360
Is that you, Peter?

150
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:41,542
I...I don't know.

151
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:44,501
Maybe.

152
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:52,133
If it's you,
then you're gonna die at 8:12 tonight.

153
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,340
- Don't go, Peter.
- I have to.

154
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,552
I have to.

155
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:07,103
Union Wells High School
is in Odessa, Texas.

156
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,190
I took the liberty
and made a phone call.

157
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,361
Homecoming is tonight.

158
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:17,572
Thank you. Thank you.

159
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:20,390
Look,  I don't know if
this is gonna happen.

160
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,993
- Just come back, okay?
- I will.

161
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,441
Hiro? Hiro!

162
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:52,311
Hi, this is Peter Petrelli,
is this Hiro Nakamura?

163
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:55,983
- No. Ah, he will be right back.
- Who is this?

164
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,861
- I'm his friend, Ando.
- Ando, right.

165
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,952
Okay, this is very important.

166
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,492
You and Hiro need to get to Odessa,
Texas, as soon as you can...

167
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,251
Union Wells High School.

168
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:09,132
Okay, that's where
the cheerleader is.

169
00:11:09,165 --> 00:11:10,542
We are in Texas already.

170
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:13,341
Midland, at the
Burnt Toast Café.

171
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:16,383
- It's outside the airport.
- You are? That's great!

172
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:18,253
Listen, I'm gonna
get on a flight,

173
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:20,652
tell Hiro that I'll be
there before he knows it.

174
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:22,932
Yes, okay. I will tell him.

175
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:25,100
Good-bye, Peter Petrelli.

176
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,773
It's gonna be okay, honey.

177
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:57,880
It's useless.

178
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,382
How is that supposed
to help me find Sylar?

179
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:02,821
He's not a vending machine.
You can't just

180
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:06,261
put the drugs in, pull a lever,
and expect a clear response.

181
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,773
I mean, he's a person.

182
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,391
Your emotions are
impairing your judgment.

183
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:14,063
Maybe, but I'm
not the only one.

184
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,440
When he wakes up,
have him paint another.

185
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:20,151
No.

186
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,991
You think I'm being emotional?

187
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,530
Do you have any idea
what we're up against?

188
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:29,583
Come here.

189
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,501
Oh, my God.

190
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:38,591
Sylar wants to do
that to my Claire.

191
00:12:39,095 --> 00:12:41,761
I will do whatever I
have to do to stop it.

192
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:47,893
Isaac can't help us.

193
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:50,603
It was a mistake
to do that to him.

194
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,440
Go to the high school.

195
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,983
Use the paintings as a guide.
Wait for Sylar.

196
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,651
You'll have help.

197
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,991
When the time is right,
neutralize him.

198
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,742
- I'll keep Claire safe at home.
- No, it's homecoming.

199
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,542
Find Sylar, take him out.

200
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:13,620
And let me worry about Claire.

201
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,512
- Congratulations, Claire.
- Thanks so much!

202
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,432
I don't know that girl.

203
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:31,012
- Holla to the queen!
- Holla back!

204
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:34,181
Everybody who wasn't my
friend is now my friend,

205
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,770
and everybody who
was my friend, isn't.

206
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:38,870
Well, it's not a
popularity contest,

207
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:40,651
it's an unpopularity contest

208
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:42,900
'cause you rocked
the freak vote.

209
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,190
I what?

210
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:46,790
Look, everybody who's like
Jackie voted for Jackie,

211
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,723
and everybody who
isn't voted for you.

212
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,891
And in this school, the unpopular
vastly outnumber the popular.

213
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:54,082
Made for a good
campaign strategy.

214
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,673
You campaigned for me?

215
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:00,172
Why?

216
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:04,510
You think all this school
spirit stuff is stupid.

217
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:07,931
I never said it was stupid.
I said it's beneath you.

218
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:10,972
But obviously it's important,
so whatever.

219
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:14,111
Now you have a little piece
of your old life back, okay?

220
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:17,230
Just don't start acting
like a bitch again.

221
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:20,193
Look, I got this
off of the Internet.

222
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,112
It supposedly has this really big
chapter on spontaneous regeneration,

223
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:29,163
so I thought it might enlighten you
on the whole Miracle-Gro of it all.

224
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:36,461
- What's with you?
- You're being so nice.

225
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:38,503
I've never been
this nice to you.

226
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,250
I mean,

227
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:43,803
I've been nice,
but I could be nicer.

228
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:46,053
Then why don't you?

229
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:50,091
Congratulations, Claire.

230
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:53,182
Mmm, is the gay boy your date?

231
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:54,771
You should tell him,

232
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,481
only one of you gets
to wear the tiara.

233
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:12,571
What? That is so unfair!

234
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:15,080
- Hon?
- I've already made up my mind.

235
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:17,273
You are being
completely unreasonable.

236
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:20,622
Do you have any idea what it
means for me to miss this game?

237
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:24,463
- You'll survive.
- But Dad!

238
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,553
No, you listen,
and you listen good.

239
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:29,062
As long as you live under my roof,
you will do as I say.

240
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,393
You may not agree, but don't think
for a moment that that matters.

241
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:35,183
You  are not leaving this house tonight.
Is that clear?

242
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,100
Crystal.

243
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:52,950
She's gonna hate you for
a long time on this one.

244
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:55,581
Let's hope so.

245
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,292
Micah! Micah!

246
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:08,511
What were you thinking?

247
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:10,382
Do you know how scared I was?

248
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:13,302
Now you know how it
felt when you left us!

249
00:16:13,728 --> 00:16:16,972
Micah, what am I
supposed to do here?

250
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:19,103
Go back! She needs us!

251
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:20,852
We've discussed this.

252
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:24,900
- Your mom...
- Dad, I know she's different, okay? I see it too.

253
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:27,191
Something happened to
her when you left.

254
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,322
It got really bad.

255
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:36,281
- Then, sometimes, she'd show up instead of Mom.
- She?

256
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:39,412
Jessica.

257
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:41,712
Jessica.

258
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,003
Dad, Mom... Mom's sick.

259
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,172
She can't help herself.

260
00:16:48,427 --> 00:16:50,213
She can't control it.

261
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:52,263
Micah.

262
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,342
Does your mom know
about Jessica?

263
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:58,970
No, I don't think so.

264
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,642
Dad, we can't just leave her.

265
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,402
If you still love her,

266
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:10,233
you'll help her.

267
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:15,160
You're right.

268
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:25,830
Do you know this boy?

269
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:28,933
You're wasting my afternoon
because of a ridiculous dream.

270
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,461
No  one said you had to come.

271
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:32,600
And who's gonna keep
you from getting killed?

272
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,023
This is a
dangerous neighborhood.

273
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:36,691
One look at your fancy shoes and
we'll both be running for our lives.

274
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:38,523
- Have you seen this boy?
- Come now, Mohinder.

275
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,060
Let's stop this nonsense.

276
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,891
Go back to the university,
talk about this like rational people.

277
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:46,452
- I am not leaving until I find him.
- I know this boy.

278
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,532
For 500 rupees,
I can tell you where he is.

279
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,820
This man is a crook,
give him nothing.

280
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:53,821
- What are you doing?
- Where?

281
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:20,350
You came to me in my
dream last night.

282
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:22,513
I don't come to anyone.

283
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:26,061
- They come to me.
- Why?

284
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:28,312
Why do they come to you?

285
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:31,771
They have questions
that need answers.

286
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:34,480
I'm not sure that
I have a question.

287
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:37,952
Yes, you do.

288
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,503
I have two paths
in front of me.

289
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:47,503
I need to know
which one to take.

290
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:50,791
Which one is my destiny.

291
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:55,211
You already have
the answer you seek.

292
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:02,263
What is it?

293
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:04,893
What's my answer?

294
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,183
Hiro.

295
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,182
Excuse me.

296
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:51,060
When was this picture taken?

297
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,020
Oh, that was
Charlie's birthday.

298
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:54,730
About six months ago.

299
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,402
- Do you know him?
- Hiro? Sure.

300
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:00,900
He and Charlie were tight.

301
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:03,201
Please, where is he now?

302
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,081
I have no idea, darlin'.

303
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:07,661
He popped out of
her life weeks ago.

304
00:20:30,435 --> 00:20:33,602
Zach? What r u doing?

305
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,653
Throwing rocks at ur window.
Open up!

306
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:56,341
What's going on?

307
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:58,552
I'm here to rescue you.

308
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,551
- Let's go.
- I'm grounded.

309
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,621
No one grounds the queen,
come on.

310
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,300
Yeah, tell that to my dad.

311
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:06,401
You only get to be
homecoming queen once.

312
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:08,653
You know what?
You've already cemented your victory

313
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:10,742
in the eyes of the student
body by punching Jackie.

314
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:13,232
Plus, if you back out now,
she becomes the queen.

315
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:16,902
My dad would pitch a fit.

316
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:18,823
So, big deal. What?

317
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:21,321
He grounds you more.
He double grounds you.

318
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:23,901
Come on, you deserve this.

319
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,413
I do deserve this.

320
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,701
And tonight,
you can be my date to the dance.

321
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,753
- Me?
- Sure, why not?

322
00:21:38,258 --> 00:21:40,420
Uh...

323
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:44,802
For a million
different reasons.

324
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:47,051
Is it about what Jackie said?

325
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:50,362
- Because I don't care...
- I don't care about that, you think I care about that?

326
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:53,493
She can call me whatever she wants.
I'm not gonna be embarrassed by it.

327
00:21:53,526 --> 00:21:54,482
I know who I am.

328
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:56,600
I like who I am.

329
00:21:56,855 --> 00:21:58,611
I like who you are. I just...

330
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:03,862
I  just wish that you
liked who you are.

331
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:08,663
I'm finally realizing who
my friends really are.

332
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,541
And that maybe being different
isn't the end of the world.

333
00:22:13,338 --> 00:22:15,210
That's just who I am.

334
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:16,833
Exactly,

335
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:19,463
you gotta embrace
your inner freak.

336
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:23,510
Because the only thing
that you'll regret is

337
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,840
denying who you really are.

338
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,441
Ando?

339
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:42,442
Hey, I'm Peter Petrelli.

340
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:45,401
How are you?
So sorry it took forever.

341
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,503
I-I couldn't get a flight,
and then taxis in this town...

342
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,873
We still have time.
Where's... where's Hiro?

343
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,583
Hiro traveled back in
time to rescue Charlie.

344
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,560
I told him it
wasn't a good idea,

345
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,850
Peter Petrelli might call,
but he insisted.

346
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,540
- What happened to her?
- She was killed.

347
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:05,672
We were sitting right here.
It happened so fast.

348
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:09,272
Next thing we know, she was dead
and the killer was gone in a flash.

349
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:14,310
Like, Okage. Uh... boogeyman.

350
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:18,320
Hiro says maybe it is the same man that
is going to attack the cheerleader.

351
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:20,901
I told Hiro do over,
is too risky.

352
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:22,363
But Hiro says

353
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:27,240
man who is too afraid to use power,
does not deserve to have power.

354
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,572
I know when,

355
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:32,173
and I know where the cheerleader
gets attacked. I have to stop him.

356
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,872
- Is this you?
- Maybe.

357
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:40,000
- You have a power, right?
- Sort of.

358
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,630
Super strength?
You bend time and space like Hiro!

359
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:48,341
No, I...I kind of absorb
the abilities of others.

360
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:51,093
- But only when they're close.
- Hmm?

361
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:54,470
Truthfully, when I'm by myself,
I don't...

362
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,720
I'm not really anything.

363
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,482
I've got less than an hour.

364
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:06,151
Okay, it happens at 8:12,
I have to go.

365
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:08,193
Coming?

366
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:10,613
No.

367
00:24:10,956 --> 00:24:12,820
I will wait for Hiro.

368
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:16,790
Without him,
I'm not really anything either.

369
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:20,661
- Maybe you should wait too.
- There's no time.

370
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,292
- I have to save the cheerleader.
- But, Peter!

371
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:28,171
You die.

372
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:37,263
- Where is she? She's gone!
- Oh, right.

373
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:41,141
I saw her and Zach skip out
across the lawn ten minutes ago.

374
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,351
She must have climbed
out her window.

375
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:45,443
Why didn't you try to stop her?

376
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:48,403
Because she's a good girl,
and she deserves this.

377
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,651
You are being way too harsh.

378
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:56,281
You don't know
what you've done.

379
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,000
If you hear from her,
call me immediately!

380
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,960
You're wasting your time.

381
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,712
Freud would tell you the boy

382
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:14,051
is merely a manifestation
of your subconscious.

383
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:17,721
Nirad? Haven't we already
had this conversation?

384
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:28,322
No, wait!

385
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,912
You're wasting your time.

386
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:39,411
Freud would tell you that the boy's
merely a manifestation of
your subconscious.

387
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:41,220
It was more than a dream,
it was real.

388
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:43,410
This boy can give me
the answers I seek.

389
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:46,261
I'm your friend, Chandra,
but you sound like a madman.

390
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:48,812
Well, all great thinkers were said
to be madmen in their time...

391
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:50,462
Darwin, Einstein, Gandhi.

392
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:53,730
Darwin was not ridiculed by his
university's biology round table.

393
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:57,021
- They weren't even listening.
- You're the one who's not listening!

394
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,553
You think you're actually
gonna find these people?

395
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:01,890
Levitation,
spontaneous regeneration?

396
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:05,943
Chandra, I know
that Shanti's death

397
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:10,480
drove you to find answers,
but it is time to let go.

398
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:14,533
If you persist on
espousing this

399
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:17,612
insanity in your writing
and in your classroom,

400
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,993
they will strip
you of your tenure.

401
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:29,002
So be it.

402
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:52,983
I just finished reading.
It's fantastic, Father.

403
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:54,981
To think that today,
all around us,

404
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:57,253
the evolutionary process
continues so dramatically!

405
00:26:57,285 --> 00:26:58,910
Who told you to read this?

406
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:01,381
No one, I saw it on your desk,
so I picked it up.

407
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:05,043
You invaded my privacy, Mohinder.
This was not for you to read.

408
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:09,043
Well, I'm sorry, but I think it's
extraordinary, and I want to help.

409
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,310
By using the Human Genome Project,
we can locate these people.

410
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:14,762
Not "we"!
You can't be part of this.

411
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:17,632
- Why not?
- Because I don't want you to be!

412
00:27:18,348 --> 00:27:20,640
I don't understand.

413
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:25,973
Darwin said a scientific
man ought to have no wishes,

414
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,272
no affections,
a heart of stone.

415
00:27:28,486 --> 00:27:31,232
That's me, Mohinder.
It's not you.

416
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:33,652
Go home.

417
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:45,201
You have your answer.

418
00:28:04,186 --> 00:28:06,272
You were trying to protect me.

419
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:44,550
Heart of stone.
Why did you have a heart of stone?

420
00:28:44,898 --> 00:28:47,312
Heart of stone. Heart of stone.

421
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:55,273
My sister.

422
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:12,041
You found them.

423
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:35,151
- Ooh, sorry!
- Sorry.

424
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:38,141
That was my fault.
I wasn't looking where I was going.

425
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,992
Hey, do you...
know this girl, Jackie Wilcox?

426
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:46,872
Uh, yeah, half-time show
starts in about five minutes.

427
00:29:47,206 --> 00:29:50,042
She'll be out on the field.
She's a cheerleader.

428
00:29:52,335 --> 00:29:56,423
- Are you a reporter or something?
- Alumni.

429
00:29:56,637 --> 00:29:58,381
I'm just curious.

430
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:06,642
You know, between you and me,
she's not that special.

431
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:09,472
Just your average teenage girl.

432
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,312
She rushed into a fire

433
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:14,770
and saved a man's life,
sounds kinda special to me.

434
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:19,311
Yeah, you're right.

435
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,280
I'm jealous.

436
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:24,703
She's our town hero. Me?

437
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:27,743
I don't win too many
popularity contests.

438
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:29,701
Hey, it gets better!

439
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:34,620
- What?
- Life after high school.

440
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:37,001
It gets a lot better.

441
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:36,062
Half-time, girls!

442
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:38,441
Come on, pump it up! Whoo!

443
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,951
Will the nerviness never cease.

444
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,032
I thought you were grounded.

445
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,453
It didn't take.

446
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:56,450
How's your eye?

447
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:58,960
Nothing I can't cover up.

448
00:32:01,385 --> 00:32:03,232
There's something
I wanna say to you,

449
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:05,250
cocaptain to cocaptain.

450
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,091
Say it.

451
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:13,013
I think you're a menace.

452
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:15,561
And I'm not just
talking about you

453
00:32:15,895 --> 00:32:18,291
punching me over your boyfriend,
the girlfriend.

454
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:20,140
I'm talking about
you in general.

455
00:32:20,448 --> 00:32:23,312
We used to be BFF's.

456
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:25,733
What happened?

457
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:28,530
Maybe I've gained
some perspective.

458
00:32:28,868 --> 00:32:31,362
I'm tired of trying to
be someone I'm not.

459
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:33,842
Well, you've been trying to
be me since second grade.

460
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,951
And now you're trying to be me.

461
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,701
How do you figure?

462
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:41,960
Your little heroic act of pulling the
guy out of the burning train car...

463
00:32:42,216 --> 00:32:44,461
wasn't your heroic act,
it was mine.

464
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:46,170
No, it wasn't.

465
00:32:46,468 --> 00:32:48,170
I have it on tape.

466
00:32:54,648 --> 00:32:58,222
You know, a good friend of mine
once said it's more important to be

467
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:01,692
honest with yourself
and happy than popular.

468
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:04,941
I think he got it right.

469
00:33:06,656 --> 00:33:08,230
Really?

470
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:10,780
Sounds like a loser to me.

471
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:15,321
Public schools suck.

472
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:19,621
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

473
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:31,843
Hello?

474
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:34,011
Stop it,
you're freaking me out!

475
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:37,363
- I thought I heard something.
- You're imagining it. Let's go!

476
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:43,850
- What is your problem?
- Don't go that way.

477
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,311
What the hell?

478
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:48,712
- Jackie, something's not right.
- No, duh!

479
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,443
We're missing the coronation.

480
00:33:50,485 --> 00:33:52,833
Believe me, if you don't want to go out
there and get that homecoming crown,

481
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,113
- I'm more than happy...
- Aah!

482
00:33:57,457 --> 00:34:00,331
No! No! No!

483
00:34:04,088 --> 00:34:05,621
Aah!

484
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,423
Claire!

485
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:11,670
Aah! Aah!

486
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,260
Run.

487
00:35:05,526 --> 00:35:06,812
Are you okay?

488
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:11,230
Run! Go!

489
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,901
Keep going! Run!

490
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,500
Oh, my God. Claire.

491
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,731
Hey, hey, hey! Run!

492
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,283
Run!

493
00:36:03,285 --> 00:36:05,741
- Who is it?
- Go, to the stadium, okay?

494
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,381
Find people, find lights.
He doesn't want to be seen.

495
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:09,722
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

496
00:36:09,757 --> 00:36:10,790
Just go!

497
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,420
Go!

498
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:51,673
No...

499
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:15,653
You...

500
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:24,820
How did you...

501
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,831
Where is he?

502
00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:32,290
I don't know.
He ran away before I got here.

503
00:37:33,547 --> 00:37:36,130
Police. Go get some help, okay?

504
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:37,920
Okay. I'll be back.

505
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,840
Hey.

506
00:37:42,765 --> 00:37:44,222
What's your name?

507
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,180
Peter.

508
00:37:47,477 --> 00:37:48,721
I'm Claire.

509
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:50,930
Are you the one?

510
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:54,523
By saving you,
did I save the world?

511
00:37:56,488 --> 00:37:57,810
I don't know.

512
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:01,613
I'm just a cheerleader.

513
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,753
Claire!

514
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:17,001
Dad. Dad.

515
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:24,303
It's okay. You're okay.

516
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:26,182
Dad, it was terrible,
Jackie, she...

517
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:28,143
I know, I know.

518
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,602
We have to go back.

519
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,683
We... we have to go back,

520
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,101
- Peter...
- No, no, no.

521
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:36,620
- He saved my life!
- No, no, no, he'll be fine.

522
00:38:36,658 --> 00:38:38,800
But we can't leave him.
We can't leave him.

523
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,611
He almost died, but then he...

524
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:43,493
He... We have to go back!
We have to go back!

525
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:46,612
The police'll take
care of everything.

526
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,281
Look at you.

527
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:51,741
You're lucky to be alive.

528
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,120
It's not luck, Dad.

529
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:59,082
I have something I
have to tell you.

530
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:14,143
You don't want to hurt me.

531
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:20,151
We just need to talk.

532
00:39:22,576 --> 00:39:25,990
You can tell me
all about yourself.

533
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:27,992
But first,

534
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:29,820
go to sleep.

535
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,792
You need to sleep.

536
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:54,973
That's the guy!

537
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,222
He's the one in the
overcoat the janitor saw.

538
00:39:57,277 --> 00:39:59,492
- Put your hands on your head!
- What the hell?

539
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:02,163
- Look at all that blood.
- It's not what you think, guys!

540
00:40:02,198 --> 00:40:04,573
- All right, hands up.
- What are you do...

541
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:05,780
It's not me!

542
00:40:06,038 --> 00:40:09,533
- He's getting away!
- Let's go! Stand up!

543
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:23,961
Mira called.

544
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,512
She said you turned
down her job offer.

545
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:29,513
You're going back to New York?

546
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:33,601
He did it, you know.

547
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,763
He discovered them.

548
00:40:35,147 --> 00:40:36,642
His theory, it was right.

549
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:39,062
And that is good news, yes?

550
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:41,810
Why didn't he tell me?

551
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:45,233
We wanted you to
live your own life.

552
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:49,530
So now that you know about them,
what will you do?

553
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:50,900
Find them.

554
00:40:51,328 --> 00:40:53,672
Tell them who they are,
if they don't already know.

555
00:40:53,705 --> 00:40:56,202
Warn them of the
dangers they face.

556
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:58,370
And who will protect you?

557
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:12,471
Next stop, Vegas.

558
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:14,763
Dad, we don't need
to go back to Vegas.

559
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:16,761
Why not?

560
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:18,933
I called Mom.

561
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:22,102
I told her where we are.
She's on her way.

562
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,732
Micah, get in the car.
Now, come on!

563
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:28,653
Dad, what's wrong?

564
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,941
We are all, at our cores,

565
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,911
the sum of our fears.

566
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:36,122
To embrace destiny,
we must, inevitably,

567
00:41:36,165 --> 00:41:39,121
face those fears
and conquer them.

568
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,412
Whether they come
from the familiar...

569
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,712
or the unknown.

570
00:41:58,437 --> 00:42:00,720
My name is Hiro Nakamura!

571
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:04,730
I'm here to save your life!

572
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:06,443
Hey, Charlie!

573
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:09,980
Charlie! Come over and
blow out the candles!

574
00:42:11,118 --> 00:42:14,360
Hold that thought, okay?
I gotta go make a wish.

575
00:42:22,087 --> 00:42:27,172
