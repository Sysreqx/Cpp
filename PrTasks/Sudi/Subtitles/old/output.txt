1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,434
Man: for over a century,
I have lived in secret;

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:06,666
Hiding in the shadows,

3
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:08,833
Alone in the world.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,168
Until now.

5
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:13,868
I am a vampire.

6
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:16,035
And this is my story.

7
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:20,068
* when there's fire *

8
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:21,567
* on a crown *

9
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:22,801
* should have turned-- *

10
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:25,769
An hour's drive
to hear that crap.

11
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,102
You know, it wasn't
even a band.

12
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:28,236
A guy with a guitar.

13
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:29,568
An hour each way.

14
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:30,869
He wasn't that bad.

15
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:32,169
He sounded like
james blunt.

16
00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:33,568
What's wrong with that?

17
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:36,002
We already have
a james blunt.
One's all we need.

18
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,902
So why did you come?

19
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:38,902
Because I love you.

20
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,836
Nicely done.

21
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:44,037
* stretches out *

22
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:46,037
* in the way beyond *

23
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:48,270
What's with all the fog?

24
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:49,337
It'll clear
in a second.

25
00:00:49,404 --> 00:00:51,504
Watch out!

26
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:00,737
Are you ok?!

27
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:03,771
We just hit someone!
Oh, my god!

28
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:06,637
Call for help.

29
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,638
Come on, come on!

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,705
Please be alive!

31
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,439
Oh, my god.

32
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:34,273
There's no signal!

33
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,507
Darren!

34
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:39,073
Darren?

35
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,409
I shouldn't
have come home.

36
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:09,142
I know the risk.

37
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,109
But I had no choice.

38
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:14,809
I have to know her.

39
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,909
Dear diary,

40
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:18,709
Today will be different.

41
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:20,642
It has to be.

42
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:24,344
I will smile,
and it will be
believable.

43
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:30,110
My smile was saying
"I'm fine, thank you."

44
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:33,344
"Yes, I feel much better."

45
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:37,843
I will no longer be
the sad little girl
who lost her parents.

46
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,145
I will start fresh,
be someone new.

47
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:45,245
It's the only way
I'll make it through.

48
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:47,478
<i>[Here wego by
mat kearney playing]</i>

49
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,278
Toast.
I can make toast.

50
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,378
It's all about the coffee,
aunt Jenna.

51
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:54,479
Is there coffee?

52
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:55,513
Your first day of school

53
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:59,346
And I'm totally
unprepared.

54
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,279
Lunch money?

55
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,513
I'm good.

56
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:03,513
Anything else?

57
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:05,779
A number two pencil?
What am I missing?

58
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:08,212
Don't you have
a big presentation today?

59
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:11,047
I'm meeting
with my thesis
advisor at...now.

60
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:12,447
Crap!

61
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,013
Then go. We'll be fine.

62
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,280
You ok?

63
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:22,180
Don't start.

64
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:26,614
* oh, oh, here we go again *

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,515
* I know
how I lost a friend *

66
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,148
* we go 'round
and 'round again *

67
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:33,947
* oh, oh *

68
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:37,048
* oh, oh *

69
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:44,648
So grams is telling me
I'm psychic.

70
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,349
Our ancestors
were from salem,

71
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,482
Which isn't all
that, I know, crazy,

72
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:50,449
But she's going on
and on about it,

73
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:51,948
And I'm like, put this woman
in a home already!

74
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,882
But then I started
thinking,

75
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:57,350
I predicted Obama and I predicted
Heath Ledger,

76
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,050
And I still think Florida
will break off

77
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:01,050
And turn into little
resort islands.

78
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,549
Elena!

79
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:04,816
Back in the car.

80
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:08,083
I did it again,
didn't I?

81
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,950
I--I'm sorry, Bonnie.

82
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,151
You were telling me that...

83
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,518
That I'm
psychic now.

84
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,451
Right. Ok,
then predict something.

85
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,384
About me.

86
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,084
I see...

87
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:26,018
What was that?!

88
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,252
Oh, my god!

89
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:29,651
Elena, are you ok?

90
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:31,285
It's ok. I'm fine.

91
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:32,285
It was like a bird
or something.

92
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,218
It came out
of nowhere.

93
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:34,951
Really, I can't be
freaked out

94
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:37,252
By cars for the rest
of my life.

95
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:42,952
I predict this year
is going to be kick ass.

96
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,852
And I predict all
the sad and dark
times are over

97
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,453
And you are going
to be beyond happy.

98
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:17,321
Major lack of
male real estate.

99
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:19,888
Look at
the shower curtain
on kelly beach.

100
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:22,522
She looks a hot--
Can I still say "tranny mess"?

101
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:24,156
No, that's over.

102
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:26,456
Ahh, find a man,
coin a phrase.

103
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:28,822
It's a busy year.

104
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:39,856
He hates me.

105
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,190
That's not hate.

106
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,123
That's "you dumped me, 
but I'm too cool to show it,

107
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,589
"But secretly
I'm listening

108
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:46,090
To air supply's
greatest hits."

109
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:49,524
Elena. Oh, my god.

110
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:50,856
How are you?

111
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:53,257
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

112
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,425
How is she?
Is she good?

113
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:56,757
Caroline, I'm right here.

114
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,624
And I'm fine.
Thank you.

115
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,657
Really?

116
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:02,757
Yes. Much better.

117
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:04,291
Oh, you poor thing.

118
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:06,324
Ok, Caroline.

119
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:07,857
Oh!

120
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:09,459
Ok, see you guys
later?

121
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:11,359
Ok! Bye.

122
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:13,758
No comment.

123
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:15,392
I'm not going
to say anything.

124
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,125
Don't take more than two
in a six-Hour window.

125
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:22,426
Hey, Vicki.

126
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:25,026
I knew I'd find you here
with the crackheads.

127
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,493
Hey.

128
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,893
Hey, Pete Wentz called.

129
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,726
He wants
his nail polish back.

130
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:31,592
<i>Pete Wentz, huh?
How old school T.R.L. of you.</i>

131
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,692
Carson Daly fan?

132
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,427
Oh, Ty, be nice.
Be nice.

133
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,793
That's Elena's
little brother.

134
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:38,859
I know who he is.

135
00:06:38,926 --> 00:06:40,127
I'll still
kick his ass.

136
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:42,027
* sense of humor's
void and numb *

137
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:44,428
* and I'm bored to tears *

138
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:46,061
* I'm bored to tears *

139
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,327
Hold up.
Who's this?

140
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,194
Elena: all I see is back.

141
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:52,161
It's a hot back.

142
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:54,594
Secretary: your records
are incomplete.

143
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,728
You're missing
immunization records,

144
00:06:56,795 --> 00:07:00,561
And we do insist
on transcripts.

145
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,062
Please look again.

146
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:06,661
I'm sure everything
you need is there.

147
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:14,762
Well, you're right.

148
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:17,196
So it is.

149
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:19,629
I'm sensing seattle,
and he plays the guitar.

150
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:22,329
You're really going to run this 
whole psychic thing

151
00:07:22,396 --> 00:07:24,197
into the ground, huh?
- Pretty much.

152
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:26,464
Jeremy,
good batch, man.

153
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:30,164
I'll be right back.

154
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,696
Please be hot.

155
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:38,097
Whoa!
Pants down, chick!

156
00:07:38,164 --> 00:07:40,697
Great.

157
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,465
It's the first
day of school
and you're stoned.

158
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:44,331
No, I'm not.
Where is it?

159
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,831
Is it on you?
Stop, all right?!

160
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,198
You need to chill yourself,
all right?

161
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:48,398
Chill myself?
What is that,

162
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:49,498
Stoner talk?

163
00:07:49,564 --> 00:07:51,231
Dude,
you are so cool.

164
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:53,664
Look, stop! I don't
have anything on me.
Are you crazy?

165
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:56,032
You haven't seen
crazy, jeremy!

166
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,865
I gave you
a summer pass,

167
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:00,132
But I am done
watching you
destroy yourself.

168
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,632
No, no, no,
you know what?

169
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:04,066
Go ahead.
Keep it up.
But just know

170
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,299
That I am going
to be there

171
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:07,765
To ruin your buzz
every time,
you got it?

172
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,033
Jeremy, I know
who you are.

173
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,067
And it's not
this person.

174
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,933
So don't be
this person.

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,368
I don't need this.

176
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,034
Thank you.

177
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,834
You're welcome.

178
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:54,336
Uh, pardon me.

179
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,769
Um...

180
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,537
Is this the men's room?

181
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,969
Yes. Um,
I was just,

182
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:06,236
Um--I was just--

183
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,769
It's a long story.

184
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:14,404
Just...

185
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:18,637
Thank you.

00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,838
Once our home state
of virginia
joined confederacy

187
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:30,005
In 1861, it created
a tremendous
amount of tension

188
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:31,539
Within the state.

189
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,871
People in virginia's
northwest region

190
00:09:34,938 --> 00:09:37,272
Had different ideals
than those from
the traditional deep south.

191
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:40,073
Then Virginia
divided in 1863

192
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,473
with the northwest region
joining the union.

194
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:19,542
* do you think
you can find it? *

195
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:22,808
* or did you trade it
for something *

196
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:24,642

Dear diary,

201
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:39,576
I made it through the day.

202
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:43,210
I must have said,
"I'm fine, thanks,"

203
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,776
At least 37 times.

204
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:48,843
And I didn't mean it once.

205
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,609
But no one noticed.

206
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:55,677
* 'cause
you won't let go *

207
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:58,111
* of anything
you hold *

208
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,445
Elena: when someone
asks, "how are you?"

209
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:03,378
They really don't
want an answer.

210
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,378
* all I need
is the air I breathe *

211
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:11,611
* and a place to rest *

212
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:13,279
Ok.

213
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,112
Hi, bird.

214
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:19,546
That's not creepy
or anything.

215
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:34,513
Shoo!

216
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,480
That's what I thought.

217
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:06,449
Ahh!

218
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:12,450
You ok?

219
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,416
Were you
following me?

220
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:19,049
No, I, uh, I just--
I saw you fall.

221
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:21,849
Uh-Huh, and you just
happened to be

222
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,715
Hanging out
in a cemetery.

223
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:27,017
I'm visiting.
I have family here.

224
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:28,551
Oh.

225
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,384
Wow. Tactless.

226
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:33,616
I'm sorry.
It's the fog,

227
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:35,616
It's making me
foggy.

228
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:38,050
And then back there,
there was this bird,

229
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:40,318
And it was all
very hitchcock
for a second.

230
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,351
That is the bird movie,
right, the hitchcock?

231
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:46,351
I'm Elena.

232
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:48,285
I'm Stefan.

233
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,584
I know.

234
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:52,051
We have history
together.

235
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,286
And english and french.

236
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:56,919
Right.

237
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,985
Oh.

238
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,885
Thanks.

239
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:13,920
Nice ring.

240
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:15,619
Oh. Um,

241
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,853
It's a family ring, yeah.

242
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,153
I'm kinda stuck with it.
It's weird, huh?

243
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,320
No, no. It's just,
I mean, there are rings

244
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,354
And then there's that.

245
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:34,854
Did you hurt yourself?

246
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,421
Hmm?
Did you hurt yourself?

247
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:37,555
Oh, uh,

248
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,122
I don't know.

249
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:49,988
Oh! Look at that.

250
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:52,721
That is not pretty.

251
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,622
You ok?

252
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,889
You should go.

253
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,390
Take care of that.

254
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,823
Really, it's nothing.

255
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,391
I lost control today.

256
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:15,724
Everything
I've kept buried inside

257
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,591
Came rushing
to the surface.

258
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:28,191
I'm simply not able
to resist her.

259
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:32,891
Thanks.
Hey.

260
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,292
Working.

261
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,326
Thanks, vick.

262
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:41,992
Do you need
another refill?

263
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:44,126
I'd love one.

264
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:49,226
Please tell me
you're not hooking
up with my sister.

265
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:51,359
I'm not hooking up
with your sister.

266
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,825
You're such a dick.

267
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:54,926
Hey, what's
your deal?

268
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:56,260
I mean, summer
you act one way

269
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:57,793
And then school
starts and you can't
be bothered.

270
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,160
Look, jeremy,
I really appreciate
all the pharmaceuticals,

271
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:01,893
But you can't keep
following me around
like a lost puppy.

272
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,160
When's the last time

273
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,494
You had sex
with a puppy?

274
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,193
Hey, keep it down.
I don't want to tell
the whole world

275
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,227
I deflowered
Elena's kid brother.

276
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:10,328
Yeah, and deflowered
and deflowered.

277
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:12,994
We hooked up a few times
in a drug haze. It's over.

278
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:15,961
You gotta back off
between you ruin things
between me and Tyler.

279
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:18,061
Oh, come on,
the guy's
a total douche.

280
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,794
He only wants you
for your ass.

281
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:21,261
Yeah?

282
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:23,628
What do you want me for?

283
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:28,195
His name
is Stefan Salvatore.

284
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,296
He lives with uncle up at 
the old Salvatore boarding house.

285
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,195
He hasn't lived here
since he was a kid.

286
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:34,262
Military family,
so they moved around a lot.

287
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,162
He's a gemini, and his
favorite color is blue.

288
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,330
You got all of that
in one day?

289
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,630
Oh, please, I got all that
between third and fourth period.

290
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:43,697
We're planning
a june wedding.

291
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:47,430
I'm meeting Bonnie
at the grill.

292
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:49,963
Ok, have fun.
Wait, I got this.

293
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,030
Don't stay out late,
it's a school night.

294
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:56,197
Well done,
aunt Jenna.

295
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,797
Oh.

296
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,897
Sorry, I was about to knock.

297
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,197
I wanted to apologize
for my disappearing act earlier.

298
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:08,398
I know it was...

299
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:10,065
Strange.

300
00:16:10,132 --> 00:16:12,032
No worries.

301
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:14,165
I get it, blood
makes you squeamish.

302
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,299
Um, something like that.

303
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,299
How's your leg?

304
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:22,132
Oh, it's fine.

305
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,898
Just a scratch,
barely.

306
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:26,700
How did you know
where I lived?

307
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,466
It's a small town.

308
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,433
I asked
the first person I saw.

309
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,300
Um, I thought
you might want this back.

310
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,133
Oh, I must have
dropped it.

311
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:40,000
I--
Thank you.

312
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,501
Don't worry,
I didn't...read it.

313
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,401
No? 

314
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,034
Why not? Most people
would have.

315
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,200
Well, I wouldn't want
anyone to read mine.

316
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:53,234
You keep a journal?

317
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:54,535
Yeah, if I don't
write it down,

318
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:56,201
I forget it.

319
00:16:56,268 --> 00:17:00,001
Memories are too important.

320
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,934
Yeah.

321
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:05,702
I'm just gonna,

322
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:09,403
Um, you don't have
to stay out there.

323
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,869
I'm fine.

324
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:25,570
Sorry, were you going
somewhere?

325
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:28,504
Yeah, I'm meeting
a friend.

326
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:32,637
Do you want to come?

327
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,370
How's Elena doing?

328
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:39,438
Her mom
and dad died.
How do you think?

329
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:40,571
She's putting on
a good face,

330
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:42,738
But it's only been
four months.

331
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:45,038
Has she said anything
about me?
Oh, no.

332
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:46,038
So not getting
in the middle.

333
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:47,238
You pick up
the phone
and call her.

334
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:49,471
I feel weird calling her.

335
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:51,238
She broke up with me.

336
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:53,571
Give it
more time, matt.

337
00:17:58,172 --> 00:18:00,673
* when I'm with him *

338
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:02,773

340
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:08,239

* who was spending *

344
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,939
Hey, I'm matt,
nice to meet you.

345
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:19,140
Hi. Stefan.

346
00:18:20,973 --> 00:18:22,340
Hey.

347
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:23,674
Hey.

348
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,041
So, you were born
in mystic falls?

349
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:28,274
Mm-Hmm. And moved
when I was
still young.

350
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,541
Parents?

351
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,441
My parents
passed away.

352
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:36,574
I'm sorry.

353
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:39,008
Any siblings?

354
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:40,542
None that I talk to.

355
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,175
I live with my uncle.

356
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:44,841
So, Stefan,

357
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:47,342
if you're new, then you don't know
about the party tomorrow.

358
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:48,908
It's a back to school thing
at the falls.

359
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:51,108
Are you going?

360
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:52,375
Of course she is.

362
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,176
You promised.

363
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,544
This was
an animal attack.

364
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,277
Don't give me that.
I know the game.

365
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:17,377
You tear them up enough,
they always suspect
an animal attack.

366
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:19,477
You said you had it
under control.

367
00:19:19,544 --> 00:19:21,110
And I do.

368
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:24,111
Please, uncle Stefan.

369
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:25,978
Mystic falls
is a different place now.

370
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:29,011
It's been quiet for years,
but there are people
who still remember.

371
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:31,111
And you being here,

372
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:33,111
It's just going
to stir things up.

373
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:34,745
It's not my intention.
Then what is?

374
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:36,378
Why did you come back?
After all this time, why now?

375
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:39,346
I don't have
to explain myself.

376
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,446
I know that you can't
change what you are.

377
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:47,146
But you don't
belong here anymore.

378
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:49,979
Where do I belong?

379
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:53,079
I can't tell you
what to do.

380
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:55,580
But coming back here
was a mistake.

381
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,946
* you want to know *

382
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,314
* know that
it doesn't hurt me *

383
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,580
* oh, oh, oh *

384
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:06,047
* you want to hear about
the deal I'm making *

385
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:09,515
* and if I only could *

386
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:12,315
* make a deal with god *

387
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:15,847
* and get him
to swap our places *

388
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,481
* be runnin' up that road *

389
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,814
* be runnin' up that hill *

390
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:25,482
* be runnin' up
that building *

391
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:27,249
* hill, hill *

392
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:29,582
* if I only could *

393
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:32,082
* be running up that hill *

394
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,649
* hill *

395
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:39,050
The battle of
willow creek

396
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:40,183
Took place right at
the end of the war

397
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,983
In our very own
mystic falls.

398
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,950
How many casualties
resulted in this battle?

399
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:47,750
Ms. Bennett?

400
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:50,516
Um...a lot?

401
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,549
I'm not sure.

402
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:54,118
Like a whole lot.

403
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,817
Cute becomes dumb
in an instant,
ms. Bennett.

404
00:20:55,884 --> 00:20:58,218
Mr. Donovan.

405
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:00,550
Would you like to take
this opportunity

406
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,084
To overcome
your embedded
jock stereotype?

407
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:05,051
It's ok, mr. Tanner,
I'm cool with it.

408
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:07,184
Hmm. Elena?

409
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:09,785
Surely you can
enlighten us about

410
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,685
One of the town's most 
significantly historical events?

411
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:14,852
I'm sorry, I--
I don't know.

412
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,952
I was willing to be
lenient last year

413
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:19,085
For obvious reasons, Elena,

414
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,885
But the personal excuses
ended with summer break.

415
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:25,419
Stefan: there were
346 casualties,

416
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:28,452
Unless you're counting
local civilians.

417
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,086
That's correct.

418
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:31,519
Mister...

419
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:32,653
Salvatore.

420
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,186
Salvatore.
Any relation to

421
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,586
The original settlers
here at mystic falls?

422
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:38,786
Distant.

423
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:40,354
Well, very good.

424
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,321
Except, of course,
there were no
civilian casualties

425
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:43,620
In this battle.

426
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:46,388
Actually,
there were 27, sir.

427
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:48,620
Confederate soldiers,
they fired on the church,

428
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:50,487
Believing it to be
housing weapons.

429
00:21:50,553 --> 00:21:51,620
They were wrong.

430
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,421
It was a night
of great loss.

431
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,155
The founder's
archives are, uh,

432
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:59,022
Stored in civil hall
if you'd like to
brush up on your facts.

433
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:01,855
Mr. Tanner.
[All chuckling]

434
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:06,855
Mr. Tanner: hmm.

435
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:21,522
* note the feeling
when we lift off *

436
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:28,556
* watching the world,
so small and low *

437
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:33,723
What do you mean,
you never hooked up?

438
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:37,291
Girl: people look up to me.

439
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,191
I have to set an example.

440
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,557
Bonnie:
just admit it, Elena.

441
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:43,791
Oh, ok, so he's
a little pretty.

442
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:46,258
He has that
romance novel stare.

443
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,958
Stefan looked deep
into her eyes,

444
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:50,958
Piercing her very soul.

445
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:53,292
Hey! You made it!

446
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:54,226
I did.

447
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:55,992
Well, let's
get you a drink.

448
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,425
Well, I'm--
Oh, come on.

449
00:22:58,492 --> 00:22:59,792
So where is he?

450
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:01,326
I don't know.

451
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:03,259
You tell me,
you're the psychic one.

452
00:23:03,326 --> 00:23:06,659
Right, I forgot.
Ok, so give me a sec.

453
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:08,159
Grams says I have
to concentrate.

454
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:10,726
Wait, you need
a crystal ball.

455
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:12,593
Ahh.

456
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,260
Ta da.

457
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:24,694
What?

458
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:25,761
That was weird.

459
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:27,861
When I touched you,
I saw a crow.

460
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,460
What?

461
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:31,028
A crow.

462
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:32,694
There was fog,

463
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:34,494
A man.

464
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,295
I'm drunk.

465
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:39,262
It's the drinking.
There's nothing
psychic about it.

466
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:42,695
Yeah? Ok, I'm gonna
get a refill.

467
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:45,828
Ok.

468
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:48,029
Bonnie!

469
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,329
Hi.

470
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:54,829
Hi.

471
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:56,629
I did it again,
didn't it?

472
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:58,096
Yeah.

473
00:23:58,163 --> 00:23:59,963
I'm sorry.

474
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:04,496
You're upset about something.
Oh, uh,

475
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:07,763
No, it's Bonnie.
She's...

476
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:10,997
You know what?

477
00:24:11,064 --> 00:24:15,031
Never mind.
You're...here.

478
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:17,597
I'm here.

479
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:22,864
* but who decides
which route we take *

480
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:30,232
* as people drift
into a dream world *

481
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:34,198
You know, you're kind
of the talk of the town.

482
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,098
Am I?
Mm-Hmm.

483
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:39,432
Mysterious new guy,
oh, yeah.

484
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:43,133
Well, you have
the mysterious thing
going, too.

485
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,632
Twinged in sadness.

486
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:49,166
What makes you think
that I'm sad?

487
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:54,167
Well, we did
meet in a graveyard.

488
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:56,000
Right.

489
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:58,433
Well, no, technically
we met in the men's room.

490
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:01,833
You don't want
to know, it's...

491
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,833
It's not exactly
party chit-Chat.

492
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,633
Well, I've never really been
very good at, uh,

493
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,101
Chit-chat.

494
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:14,567
Last spring...

495
00:25:14,634 --> 00:25:18,302
My parents' car
drove off of a bridge

496
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:19,901
Into the lake.

497
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:23,101
And I was in the backseat

498
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:25,169
And I survived, but...

499
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:28,635
They didn't.

500
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:31,468
So that's my story.

501
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:43,137
You won't be sad
forever, Elena.

502
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:56,671
No, Ty.

503
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:58,637
I'm not having sex
against a tree.

504
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:00,338
Oh, come on,
it would be hot.
For who?

505
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:01,704
No, it's not
going to happen.

506
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:03,771
It's not going to
happen, not here,
not like this.

507
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:06,470
No. I said no.

508
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:08,804
I said no!
Ow, that hurts!

509
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:10,438
Hey,
leave her alone.

510
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:12,505
You know, you're starting
to get on my nerves, gilbert.

511
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,838
Just go, Tyler, get the hell
away from me.

512
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:17,738
Wow. Vicki donovan says no.

513
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:19,471
That's a first.

514
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:23,372
I didn't need your help.

515
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:25,173
It seems like
you did.

516
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,873
He was just drunk.
I'm drunk.

517
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,906
Am I throwing
myself at you?

518
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:29,206
No, you're worse.

519
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:31,006
You want to talk to me,
get to know me,

520
00:26:31,073 --> 00:26:33,940
See into my soul and screw
and screw and screw

521
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:36,439
Until you're done with me.

522
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:38,307
Is that what
you think?

523
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:41,041
That's what I know.

524
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:49,807
I like Bonnie,
she seems like a good friend.

525
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,207
Best friend
in the world.
And matt,

526
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:54,342
He can't seem to, uh,
take his eyes off of us.

527
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:56,808
Matt's that friend
since childhood

528
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,242
That you start
dating

529
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:01,108
Because you owe it
to yourselves

530
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:03,409
To see if you can
be more.

531
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:06,342
And?

532
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:08,875
And then
my parents died,

533
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:12,542
And everything
changes.

534
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:13,676
Anyway, matt and I,

535
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:16,209
Together we just,
I don't know,

536
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:17,876
It wasn't, um...

537
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:20,310
It wasn't...

538
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,509
Passionate.

539
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,077
No.

540
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:33,843
No, it wasn't
passionate.

541
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,378
Hey, um,
are you ok?

542
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:41,444
Um,

543
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:43,011
Your eye,
it just, it's--

544
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,711
Oh, um...

545
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:48,378
Yeah, no.
It's, um, it's nothing.

546
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:50,245
Um, are you thirsty?

547
00:27:50,312 --> 00:27:52,111
I'm gonna get us a drink.

548
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:14,147
Jeremy?

549
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:16,513
Is that you?

550
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,580
Jeremy?

551
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,382
Looking for someone?

552
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:02,083
Hey.

553
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,616
When you
broke up with me,

554
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:10,917
You said it was
because you needed
some time alone.

555
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:12,550
You don't look
so alone to me.

556
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:15,483
Matt, you don't
understand. It's--

557
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,817
That's ok, Elena.

558
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:19,184
You do what
you have to do.

559
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,617
I just want to let
you know that...

560
00:29:22,684 --> 00:29:25,252
I still believe in us.

561
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:28,585
And I'm not
giving up on that.

562
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:31,351
* and when I think
about a day without *

563
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:33,751
Matt.

564
00:29:33,818 --> 00:29:35,285
* every day's the same *

565
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:37,118
* wish that you could
find someone *

566
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:39,519
Hey! There you are.

567
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:40,819
Have you been down
to the falls yet?

568
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:42,186
Because they are
really cool at night.

569
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:44,719
And I can show you.

570
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:46,552
If you want.

571
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,153
I think you've had
too much to drink.

572
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,652
Well, of course
I have.

573
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,519
So--
Caroline.

574
00:29:52,586 --> 00:29:54,254
You and me,

575
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:56,353
It's not gonna happen.

576
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,120
Sorry.

577
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:06,120
* no, don't *

578
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:08,820
I was wondering
who abducted you,

579
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,188
But now I know.

580
00:30:11,255 --> 00:30:13,721
Is she like that with,
uh, all the guys?

581
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:14,955
No.

582
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,288
You're fresh meat.

583
00:30:16,354 --> 00:30:17,855
She'll back off eventually.
Hmm.

584
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:20,988
God, you gotta be kidding me!

585
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:22,255
What is it?

586
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,488
My brother.
The drunk one?

587
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:25,822
That would be the one.

588
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,089
Excuse me.
Need some help?

589
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:29,856
Trust me, you're not
going to want to
witness this.

590
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:32,522
Jeremy!

591
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:33,655
Jeremy!

592
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:35,789
Jeremy, where the hell
are you going?

593
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:36,956
I don't want
to hear it!

594
00:30:37,022 --> 00:30:40,090
Yeah, well, too bad!

595
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:42,456
Vicki? No!

596
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:45,123
Oh, my god, it's Vicki!
Oh, my god!

597
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:48,389
No!

598
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:51,957
Somebody help!

599
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:54,791
Vicki? Vicki,
what the hell?!

600
00:30:54,858 --> 00:30:56,124
What happened to her?

601
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:57,191
Somebody,
call an ambulance!

602
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:59,457
Everybody back up,
give her some space!

603
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,058
It's her neck.
Something bit her.
She's losing a lot of blood.

604
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:03,225
Put this on her neck.

605
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,891
Vicki, Vicki, come on,
open your eyes, look at me.

606
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:24,593
What's going on?

607
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,492
Someone else was
attacked tonight,
Zach, and it wasn't me.

608
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:52,294
Damon.

609
00:31:54,628 --> 00:31:57,128
Hello, brother.

610
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:07,761
Crow's a bit much,
don't you think?

611
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,129
Wait till you see
what I can do
with the fog.

612
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,395
When'd you get here?

613
00:32:13,462 --> 00:32:16,429
Well, I couldn't miss
your first day at school.

614
00:32:18,963 --> 00:32:20,629
Your hair's different.

615
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:22,562
I like it.

616
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:25,663
It's been
15 years, Damon.

617
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,964
Thank god.

618
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,030
I couldn't take
another day of the nineties.

619
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:31,030
That horrible grunge look?

620
00:32:31,097 --> 00:32:34,331
Did not suit you.

621
00:32:34,396 --> 00:32:37,064
Remember, Stefan,
it's important
to stay away from fads.

622
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,364
Why are you here?

623
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:40,497
I miss
my little brother.

624
00:32:40,564 --> 00:32:42,031
You hate small towns.

625
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:43,731
It's boring.
There's nothing
for you to do.

626
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,798
I've managed to keep
myself busy.

627
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:48,531
You know, you left
that girl alive tonight.

628
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:50,131
That's very clumsy of you.

629
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:54,266
Ah. That can be
a problem...for you.

630
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:58,699
Why are you here now?

631
00:32:58,765 --> 00:33:01,266
I could ask you
the same question.

632
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,498
However,
I'm fairly certain

633
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,199
Your answer can be
summed up all into

634
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:07,365
One little word...

635
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:09,133
Elena.

636
00:33:33,134 --> 00:33:34,268
Hey.

637
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:36,734
We're gonna go
mainline coffee,
wait for news.

638
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,468
I gotta take
jeremy home.

639
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:43,069
Elena, there's no way
I'm psychic.

640
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:45,368
I know that.

641
00:33:45,435 --> 00:33:47,702
But whatever I saw,

642
00:33:47,768 --> 00:33:49,969
Or I think I saw,

643
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:53,135
I have this feeling...

644
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:55,736
Bonnie, what?

645
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,569
That it's just
the beginning.

646
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:06,203
She took
my breath away.

647
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,402
Elena.

648
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:11,737
She's a dead ringer
for katherine.

649
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:15,403
Is it working, Stefan?

650
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,837
Being around her,
being in her world?

651
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,238
Does it make you
feel alive?

652
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:20,338
She's not katherine.

653
00:34:20,403 --> 00:34:21,670
Well, let's hope not.

654
00:34:21,737 --> 00:34:23,470
We both know
how that ended.

655
00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:25,805
Tell me something,
when's the last time

656
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:28,305
You had something
stronger than
a squirrel?

657
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:31,339
I know what you're doing,
Damon. It's not gonna work.

658
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,205
Yeah? Come on.
Don't you crave
a little?

659
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,471
Stop it. Let's do it.
Together.

660
00:34:35,538 --> 00:34:37,205
I saw a couple girls
out there.

661
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:39,572
Or just, let's just
cut to the chase,

662
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,906
Let's just go
straight for Elena!

663
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:42,606
Stop it!

664
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:45,472
Imagine what her
blood tastes like!

665
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:46,973
I can.

666
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,639
I said stop!

667
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,440
I was impressed.

668
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:07,974
I give it a six.

669
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,708
Missing style, but I was
pleasantly surprised.

670
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,975
Very good
with the whole face--

671
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:17,242
thing.
It was good.

672
00:35:17,308 --> 00:35:19,841
You know, it's all fun and games,
Damon, huh?

673
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:22,374
But wherever you go,
people die.

674
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:24,542
That's a given.
Not here.

675
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:27,142
I won't allow it.

676
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,976
I take that
as an invitation.

677
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,542
Damon, please.

678
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:33,542
After all these
years, can't we just
give it a rest?

679
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:36,309
I promised you
an eternity of misery,

680
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,809
So I'm just keeping my word.

681
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:40,843
Just stay away
from Elena.

682
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,210
Where's your ring?

683
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:49,177
Oh, yeah, sun's coming up
in a couple of hours,

684
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:52,810
And, poof,
ashes to ashes.

685
00:35:56,878 --> 00:35:58,510
Relax.

686
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:02,844
It's right here.

687
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,246
You should know better
than to think you're
stronger than me.

688
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:20,445
You lost that fight
when you stopped

689
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,445
Feeding on people.

690
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:24,946
I wouldn't try it again.

691
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,412
I think we woke
Zach up. Hmm.

692
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,313
Sorry, Zach.

693
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:48,914
You ok?

694
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:54,581
I called Jenna,
she's on her way.

695
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,715
Those people
in uniforms,

696
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:02,414
Last time I checked,
they're the police.

697
00:37:09,016 --> 00:37:13,883
People are going
to stop giving you
breaks, jer.

698
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:17,016
They just don't care
anymore.

699
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:20,149
They don't remember
that our parents
are dead,

700
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:23,782
Because they've got
their own lives
to deal with.

701
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,251
The rest of the world
has moved on.

702
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:30,284
You should try, too.

703
00:37:30,351 --> 00:37:32,416
I've seen you in the cemetery
writing in your diary.

704
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,884
Is that--Is that
supposed to be you
moving on?

705
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:42,484
Mom and dad wouldn't
have wanted this.

706
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:51,352
Are you sober yet?

707
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:54,785
No. 

708
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:56,485
Keep drinking.
I gotta get you home.

709
00:37:56,552 --> 00:37:58,518
I gotta get me home.

710
00:37:58,585 --> 00:38:01,619
Why didn't he
go for me?

711
00:38:01,685 --> 00:38:03,152
You know, how come

712
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:06,585
The guys that I want
never want me?

713
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:07,585
I'm not touching that.

714
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,987
I'm inappropriate.

715
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,187
I always say
the wrong thing.

716
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:13,620
And...

717
00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:16,987
Elena always says
the right thing.

718
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:20,320
She doesn't even try!

719
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:21,453
And he just picks her.

720
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,888
And she's always the one
that everyone picks,

721
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:25,721
For everything.

722
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:29,721
And I try so hard,

723
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:30,954
And...

724
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:33,188
I'm never the one.

725
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:37,954
It's not a competition,
Caroline.

726
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:43,189
Yeah, it is.

727
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:46,055
* I was a heartbreaker *

728
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:47,455
* I loved you *

729
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:50,521
* the same way I do *

730
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:57,489
* but I've got so much
wickedness and sin *

731
00:38:57,556 --> 00:38:59,223
* my name is pearl *

732
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,956
* and I love you *

733
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:05,789
* the best way I know how *

734
00:39:05,856 --> 00:39:07,723
Vicki...

735
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:09,624
Hey.

736
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,024
Hey, it's ok.

737
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:12,157
You're gonna be ok.

738
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,457
Matt--
Shh.

739
00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:16,191
Hey, don't try
to talk, ok?

740
00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:19,124
You're fine.

741
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,024
Vampire.

742
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:32,025
Dear diary,

743
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:34,958
I couldn't
have been more wrong.

744
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:38,325
I thought that I could smile,
nod my way through it;

745
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:40,759
Pretend like
it would all be ok.

746
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:45,526
* some things
we don't talk about *

747
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,359
* better do without *

748
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,193
I had a plan.

749
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:52,560
I wanted to change
who I was;

750
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:55,327
Create a life
as someone new,

751
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:58,294
Someone without the past.

752
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,893
Without the pain.

753
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,227
Someone alive.

754
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:06,561
* you can never say never *

755
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:09,261
But it's
not that easy.

756
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:13,328
The bad things
stay with you.

757
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:14,761
They follow you.

758
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:16,994
* than we were before *

759
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:20,328
* don't let me go *

760
00:40:20,395 --> 00:40:22,361
You can't
escape them,

761
00:40:22,428 --> 00:40:25,563
As much as you want to.

762
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:28,728
* don't let me go *

763
00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:32,663
* don't let me go *

764
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,762
* don't let me go *

765
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:41,096
* don't let me go *

766
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:44,297
All you can do
is be ready for the good.

767
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:46,363
So when it comes,

768
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:50,330
You invite it in,
because you need it.

769
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:52,497
I need it.

770
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:56,797
* I will be your guardian *

771
00:40:56,864 --> 00:41:00,064
* for all that's coming in *

772
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:02,331
I know it's late.

773
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:04,264
But, uh...

774
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:07,031
I needed to know
that you were ok.

775
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,399
You know, for months,

776
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:12,332
That's all anyone's
wondered about me.

777
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:14,299
If I'll be ok.

778
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:16,765
What do you tell them?

779
00:41:17,898 --> 00:41:21,265
That I'll be fine.

780
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:23,999
Do you ever mean it?

781
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:27,200
Ask me tomorrow.

782
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:33,966
It's warmer in the house.
We can talk.

783
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:39,000
Would you like
to come in?

784
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:43,267
Yes.

1
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:02,867
For over a century,

2
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:04,634
I have lived in secret, until now.

3
00:00:04,701 --> 00:00:07,267
I know the risk, but I had no choice.

4
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:08,367
I have to know her.

5
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:10,168
I'm Elena.
I'm Stefan.

6
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:12,667
I know. We have history together.

7
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:15,367
Last spring, my parents' car

8
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:17,734
drove off of a bridge into the lake.

9
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,867
You won't be sad forever, Elena.

10
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:20,867
I live with my uncle.

11
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:22,034
Any siblings?

12
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:23,101
None that I talk to.

13
00:00:23,168 --> 00:00:25,467
Hello, brother.
Damon.

14
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:27,467
Elena, she's a dead ringer for Catherine.

15
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:29,168
Wherever you go,
people die.

16
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,467
My God, it's Vickie!

17
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:32,267
Something bit her, she's losing a lot of blood.

18
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,901
Somebody help!

19
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:36,233
Vampire.

20
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,634
Don't you crave a little?
Stop.

21
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:39,400
Let's do it. Let's just go straight for Elena.

22
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:40,934
Imagine what her blood tastes like!

23
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:43,134
Stop!
Arghh!

24
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:47,134
Stay away from Elena.

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,400
I'll take that as an invitation.

26
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,901
* I tremble *

27
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,500
* tremble, tremble *

28
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,934
* Tremble, tremble *

29
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,600
* tremble, tremble *

30
00:00:56,667 --> 00:01:00,168
* You're gonna eat me alive *

31
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,467
Hey. Did you hear that?
Hear what?

32
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:06,901
I heard thunder.

33
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,068
There's no thunder.

34
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,467
Are you sure?

35
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:12,267
Because if it rains,
then we won't be able
to see the comet.

36
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,701
It's not gonna rain.

37
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,701
Listen, i...

38
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:17,767
Got you a little
something.

39
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,267
It's back
in the car.

40
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,233
Don't you move.
mm-mm.

41
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,634
Hmm?

42
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:24,634
* Can you hear my heart *

43
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:28,500
* Beating like a hammer? *

44
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:29,600
Stay dry.

45
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:30,967
It's not gonna rain.

46
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,867
* My heart keeps beating like a hammer *

47
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:45,867
I knew it!

48
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:49,034
* Come take my pulse *

49
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:51,934
I told you it was gonna rain!

50
00:01:56,367 --> 00:02:00,534
* Keeps beating like a hammer *

51
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,667
* Beating like a hammer *

52
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,634
Open!

53
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:30,634
No!

54
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,068
Please!

55
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,267
Dear diary,

56
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,233
this morning is... different.

57
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,400
There is change. I can sense it,

58
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,101
feel it.

59
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:11,734
I'm awake.

60
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:14,267
For the first time in a long time,

61
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:18,801
I feel completely and undeniably wide awake.

62
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:22,068
For once, I don't regret the day before it begins.

63
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:24,400
I welcome the day...

64
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:26,934
Both: because I know...

65
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:28,734
I will see her again.

66
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:31,101
I will see him again.

67
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:34,701
For the first time in a long time,

68
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:36,667
I feel good.

69
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,634
* And every building falls *

70
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,333
* And all the stars fade *

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,634
Do I look adult?

72
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,500
As in respectfully parental?

73
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,168
Depends where you're going.

74
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:50,001
Jeremy's parent-teacher conference.

75
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:51,834
Hair up or down?

76
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:53,267
Sexy stewardess.

77
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,734
Boozy housewife.

78
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,434
Up it is.

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,134
You're feisty today.

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,767
I feel good, which is rare.
So I've decided to go with it.

81
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:05,834
Fly free, walk on sunshine, and all that stuff.

82
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:07,233
Where is Jeremy?

83
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,567
He left early.

84
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,333
Something about getting to wood shop early

85
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,367
to finish a birdhouse.

86
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:17,333
There is no wood shop, is there?

87
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,300
No.
Yeah.

88
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,567
* ooh, ooh *

89
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:23,834
* closer to love *

90
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,600
* ooh, ooh *

91
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,534
You can't be in here, hon. Visiting hours

92
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
don't start till 9:00.

93
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,901
I just... 

94
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,734
How is she?

95
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,500
She's lost a lot of blood.

96
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,168
Yeah, but she's gonna be ok, right?

97
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,434
She needs her rest.

98
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,734
So you come back later.

99
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,500
Come on.

100
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:48,134
Originally discovered nearly 5 centuries ago,

101
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,168
it hasn't been over Mystic Falls in over 145 years.

102
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,500
Now, the comet will be its brightest

103
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:55,667
right after dusk

104
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,367
during tomorrow's celebration.

105
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:00,233
Are we bothering you, Mr. Salvatore?

106
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,767
Ms. Gilbert?

107
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:08,534
I brought it.

108
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,934
Told you.

109
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:12,034
"Wuthering Heights" by Ellis Bell.

110
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:15,300
You know, I can't believe she didn't use her real name.

111
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:18,001
All the Bronte sisters used pseudonyms.

112
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,034
It was the time.

113
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,667
Female writers weren't very accepted then.

114
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:24,001
Where did you get it?

115
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:27,834
Uh, it was passed down.

116
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,267
Through the family.

117
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,434
Ah.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,301
I have lots of books. Go ahead. Keep it.

119
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,267
Oh, no. I... 

120
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,901
But I would like to read it again.

121
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,700
I promise I'll give it back.

122
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:41,867
Ok.

123
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,067
I'm confused.

124
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,301
Are you psychic or clairvoyant?

125
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:47,433
Technically, grams says I'm a witch.

126
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,433
My ancestors were these really cool

127
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,867
Salem witch chicks or something.

128
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,268
Grams tried to explain it all,

129
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,467
but she was looped on the liquor

130
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,800
so I kinda tuned out. Crazy family, yes.

131
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:57,567
Witches? I don't think so.

132
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:59,700
Yeah, well, feel free to conjure
up the name and number

133
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,467
of that guy from last night.

134
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:03,500
I didn't see him, you did.

135
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,334
Why didn't you just talk to him?

136
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,067
I don't know. I was drunk.

137
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:12,201
* I never know how to treat you *

138
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:16,567
* You say I love you but it ain't true *

139
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:18,034
* I like to grab you by the hair *

140
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:20,334
Hey, Tyler. Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,800
I was just wondering how Vickie's doing,

142
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,433
since you guys are so close.

143
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,533
Is she ok?

144
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,934
She's fine. Now get out of here.

145
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:28,001
How bad is she?

146
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:29,467
Do they know what attacked her?

147
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,101
Is she going to make a full recovery?

148
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,967
Was she happy to see you?
What room number was she in?

149
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:34,134
I'm going to kick your ass.

150
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:35,334
Yeah, you keep saying that,

151
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,767
but when are you actually going to do it?

152
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:39,433
Huh? 'Cause I vote for right here and right now.

153
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,101
* I like to grab you by the hair *

154
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,334
Walk away, Gilbert.

155
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,101
It's your final warning.

156
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,634
No, this is your final warning, dick.

157
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,467
I'm sick of watching you play Vickie.

158
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,334
You hurt herne more time,
I swear to God, I will kill you.

159
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,001
* I like to grab you by the hair *

160
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:56,500
Damn, that was like a death threat.

161
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:57,600
Did you hear that?

162
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,867
They're keeping her overnight to make sure

163
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:00,034
There's no infection,

164
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:01,467
but she should be able to come home tomorrow.

165
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:02,901
That's good news.
Yeah.

166
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:04,767
Did you get in touch with your mom?

167
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,734
Called and left a message.

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,734
She's in Virginia Beach with her boyfriend,

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,767
so... we'll see how long it takes
her to come rushing home.

170
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:15,268
Vickie's lucky that she's ok.

171
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,067
I know, and now there's talk
of some missing campers.

172
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:22,234
Did she say what kind of animal
it was that attacked her?

173
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:23,901
She said it was a vampire.

174
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,134
What?

175
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:27,101
Yeah, she wakes up last night
and mutters "vampire"

176
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,700
and then passes out.

177
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,634
Ok, that is weird.

178
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,467
I think she was drunk.

179
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,867
So what's up with you and the new guy?

180
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:43,301
Matt, the last thing that I want to do is hurt you.

181
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:44,901
You know, I'm... 

182
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,834
I'm actually gonna go back to the hospital.

183
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,400
I want to be there when Vickie wakes up,

184
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:51,433
get the real story about last night.

185
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,934
Ok.

186
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:07,368
As Jeremy's teacher, I'm concerned.

187
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:08,667
All right? It's the third day of school

188
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:11,001
and he's skipped 6 of his classes.

189
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,767
Mr. Tanner,

190
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,667
are you aware that Jeremy
and Elena's parents died?

191
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:18,301
4 months ago, a great loss.

192
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:19,433
Car accident.

193
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,400
Wickery bridge, if I remember correctly.

194
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,800
And you're related to the family how?

195
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:26,134
The, uh, mother's kid sister?

196
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,667
Younger sister.

197
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:30,034
Right.
Yes.

198
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,201
6 classes? Are you sure?

199
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:34,234
I mean, that's kind of hard to do.

200
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:36,400
Not when you're on drugs.

201
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:39,067
It's his attempt at coping, Ms. Summers.

202
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:40,800
And the signs are there.

203
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:42,867
He's moody, withdrawn, argumentative,

204
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:45,067
hungover.

205
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:48,234
Are there any other relatives in the picture?

206
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:50,201
I'm their sole guardian.

207
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,301
Uh-huh.

208
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:54,400
Could there be?

209
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:59,201
What are you suggesting, exactly?

210
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:02,234
It's an impossible job, isn't it,

211
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:04,667
raising two teens?

212
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,934
It's been tough,

213
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:09,467
but, no, it's not.

214
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:10,834
Wrong answer.

215
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:13,634
It is an extremely impossible job,

216
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,034
and anything less and you're not doing it properly.

217
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,067
Whoa!

218
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:47,067
Vick.

219
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:49,201
Vickie, hey.

220
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:52,067
Vick, it's Matt. Hey, what's wrong?

221
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,400
No! No!

222
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,400
Get off!

223
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:56,500
No!

224
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,400
No!

225
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,034
No!

226
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,901
It was an animal that attacked you.

227
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,767
It came out of the night and jumped you.

228
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,201
You blacked out.

229
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:07,567
It's all you remember.
It's all I remember.

230
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,500
An animal attacked you. You blacked out.

231
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,268
It's all you remember.
It's all I remember.

232
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:13,700
Nurse! I need help!

233
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,467
It's my sister.

234
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,567
She seems fine.

235
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:17,067
Well, I was talking to grams,

236
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,201
and she said the comet is
a sign of impending doom.

237
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:20,834
The last time it passed over Mystic Falls,

238
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:22,967
there was lots of death.
So much blood and carnage,

239
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:26,201
it created a bed of paranormal activity.

240
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,167
Yeah, and then you poured grams another shot

241
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:31,034
and she told you about the aliens.

242
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:32,433
So then what?

243
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,934
So then nothing.

244
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:36,467
You and Stefan talked all night?

245
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,368
There was no sloppy first kiss

246
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:40,368
or touchy feely of any kind?

247
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,400
Nope.

248
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,567
We didn't go there.

249
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:43,667
Not even a handshake?

250
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,034
I mean, Elena,

251
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:46,034
we are your friends.

252
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:47,533
Ok? You are supposed to share the smut.

253
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,234
We just talked for hours.

254
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:50,533
Ok, what is with the blockage?

255
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,533
Just jump his bones already! Ok, it's easy.

256
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,901
Boy likes girl, girl likes boy,

257
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,800
sex.

258
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,533
Profound.

259
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:04,400
* ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

260
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:05,368
Where are you going?

261
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,767
Caroline's right. It is easy.

262
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:08,834
If I sit here long enough,

263
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,467
I'll end up talking myself out of it

264
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:14,167
instead of doing what I started
the day saying I was going to do.

265
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,467
* I trust you *

266
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:19,467
I picked up dinner. Tacos.

267
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:20,400
I had an urge for guacamole.

268
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:21,433
No, I'm good, thanks.

269
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,800
Eat anyway. It's a ruse.

270
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,700
I want to talk.

271
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28,068
Hey, you! Come.

272
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:30,233
Sit.

273
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:38,833
Back in school, freshman year,

274
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,334
I could eat my weight in nachos,

275
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:42,167
with extra cheese.

276
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:45,000
It was my munchie food whenever I got stoned.

277
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,167
You get high?

278
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:47,967
Did.

279
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,100
Past tense.

280
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,301
But, yeah. Loved it.

281
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,267
Anything to get a little distraction

282
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:56,034
from life... reality.

283
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,501
And it worked.

284
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,201
For a while.

285
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:00,668
Never lasts, though.

286
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:04,201
Hey, I'm not saying I wouldn't
love to rail back and kick it,

287
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:05,668
but with a thesis looming

288
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,700
and a waistline expanding...

289
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:19,067
What the... 

290
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:21,167
Finally you're awake.

291
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,634
Hey. How are you feeling?

292
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,967
You look better.

293
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:27,733
I was worried before.

294
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,034
You really had me freaked
out with all that screaming.

295
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,467
Wait, what are you talking about?

296
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:34,900
You don't remember?

297
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:39,167
I feel fine.

298
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:42,534
Good, good.

299
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:45,067
Doctor said you could come home tomorrow.

300
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,167
Vick, what attacked you in the woods?

301
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,700
An animal.

302
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,767
What else could it have been?

303
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,767
Hey. How do you feel?

304
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:04,634
I'm ok.

305
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,601
I... I'm gonna... 

306
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:09,967
I'm gonna go grab a coffee.

307
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:12,100
Hey, Jer.

308
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:14,668
Why are you here?

309
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,800
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

310
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:18,434
Did you see that look on Matt's face?

311
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:21,634
That was suspicion. I don't want people

312
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,000
to find out about us, Jeremy.

313
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,401
Well, you gotta get over that.

314
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:27,067
Tyler is finally showing some interest.

315
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,634
You have to get over that, too.

316
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,301
Do you see Mr. Concerned?

317
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,601
Tyler? Are you under there?

318
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:35,634
No.

319
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,534
It's not cool for people to know.

320
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:41,668
Ok? I'm older than you,

321
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:43,934
and Matt and Elena would freak.

322
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,034
No one's going to suspect anything.

323
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,301
Why wouldn't I check on you?

324
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,301
I mean, I'm the one who found you.

325
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,900
You are?

326
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:53,900
Yeah, I carried you out of the woods.

327
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,767
Thank you.

328
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,467
Yeah, you're welcome.

329
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:30,934
Stefan?

330
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:39,867
Stefan?

331
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,401
I... I'm sorry for barging in. The door was...

332
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,867
Open.

333
00:16:19,534 --> 00:16:22,367
You must be Elena.

334
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,934
I'm Damon, Stefan's brother.

335
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:26,201
He didn't tell me he had a brother.

336
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:27,667
Well, Stefan's not one to brag.

337
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,934
Please, come.

338
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:32,433
I'm sure Stefan will be along any second.

339
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,700
Wow.

340
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,700
This is your living room?

341
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:41,700
Living room, parlor, Sotheby's auction.

342
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,667
It's a little kitschy for my taste.

343
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:47,734
I see why my brother's so smitten.

344
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,201
It's about time. For a while there,

345
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:52,168
I never thought he'd get over the last one.

346
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:55,201
Nearly destroyed him.

347
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:56,634
The last one?

348
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,901
Yeah.

349
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:00,234
Katherine, his girlfriend?

350
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:05,367
Oh, you two haven't had the
awkward exes conversation yet.

351
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:06,801
Nope.

352
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:10,534
Oops. Well, I'm sure it'll come up now.

353
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,201
Or maybe he didn't want to tell you

354
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:16,467
because he didn't want you
to think he was on the rebound.

355
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:19,934
We all know how those relationships end.

356
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,934
You say it like

357
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:24,001
every relationship is doomed to end.

358
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,667
I'm a fatalist.

359
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:28,867
Hello, Stefan.

360
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:31,400
Elena.

361
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,634
I didn't know you were coming over.

362
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,801
I know. I should have called, I just... 

363
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,567
Oh, don't be silly. You're welcome any time.

364
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:38,168
Isn't she, Stefan?

365
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,168
You know, I should break out
the family photo albums,

366
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:43,168
or some home movies.

367
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,034
But... I have to warn you.

368
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,367
He wasn't always such a looker.

369
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,767
Thank you for stopping by, Elena.

370
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:52,500
Nice to see you.

371
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,333
Yeah, I should probably go.

372
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,700
It was nice to meet you, Damon.

373
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:02,001
Great meeting you, too, Elena.

374
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:11,268
Stefan?

375
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,034
Stefan?

376
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:29,134
Great gal.

377
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:31,634
Whoo. She's got spunk.

378
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:37,001
You, on the other hand, look pooped.

379
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:39,967
Did you over-exert yourself today?

380
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:42,333
Let me guess... hospital.

381
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,333
Someone had to clean up your mess.

382
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,867
Well, were you successful?

383
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:48,567
Did the powers of persuasion work?

384
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:50,034
Remember, if you don't feed properly,

385
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:51,901
none of those little tricks work right.

386
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:52,901
How long was Elena here?

387
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,667
Were you worried, Stefan?

388
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,567
Scared we may be doomed

389
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:58,667
to repeat the past?

390
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:01,867
Isn't that why you play your little
game, "I'm a high school human"?

391
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,234
I'm not playing any game.
Of course you are.

392
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,400
We both know

393
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,268
the closest you'll ever get to humanity

394
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,801
is when you rip it open and feed on it.

395
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:12,168
What kind of game are you playing...

396
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,834
Damien?

397
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:18,101
Guess you'll just have to wait and see, won't you?

398
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:27,333
He's on the rebound and has raging family issues.

399
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,067
Well, at least it's an ex-girlfriend.

400
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,168
Wait till you date a guy with mommy issues

401
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:32,934
or cheating issues.

402
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:35,700
Or amphetamine issues.

403
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:39,034
Jeremy.

404
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:45,700
Jeremy, where were you?

405
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,901
More stoner stories?

406
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,467
Look, Jenna, I get it, you were cool.

407
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:51,268
And so that's... that's cool.

408
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,600
Oh, no, no, no!

409
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,367
Ow! Why?

410
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:57,333
Why... why did you do that? Listen up!

411
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,101
Quit ditching class or you're grounded.

412
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:00,101
No discussion.

413
00:20:00,168 --> 00:20:03,168
Parental authority, I like it.

414
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:04,901
Sleep tight.

415
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:09,001
* And I'm an animal *

416
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:12,767
* You're an animal, too *

417
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,600
Matt.

418
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:57,867
Mattie?

419
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,167
Tonight, night of the comet.

420
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:22,768
Would you like a program?

421
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,567
He didn't call, huh?

422
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:28,567
Or text.

423
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,401
But I realized we never even exchanged that stuff.

424
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:32,301
We've never gotten to the texting part.

425
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:34,167
That's an important milestone in any relationship.

426
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:36,867
Isn't it?
The timing is wrong, anyway.

427
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:38,833
When is it ever right?

428
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,267
I'm not ready, Bonnie.

429
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,434
Who is?

430
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:46,200
At least I put myself out there.

431
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:48,067
Is that what you're calling it?

432
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:49,967
What do you mean?

433
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:52,434
All I'm hearing is reasons why you can't.

434
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:54,768
* Get back down to street level *

435
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,534
* I get around *

436
00:21:56,601 --> 00:22:00,534
* Here I come when I better go *

437
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:04,534
* I say yes when I ought to say no *

438
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:08,534
* Here I come when I better go *

439
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:13,167
* I say yes when I ought to say no *

440
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,434
What is Damon doing here? Why did he come home?

441
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:27,900
'Cause I came home.

442
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,234
He wants to make my life miserable.

443
00:22:29,301 --> 00:22:30,501
That's how he enjoys his.

444
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,800
Well, he's putting us all at risk.

445
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,768
This girl in the hospital could talk.

446
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,134
She won't.

447
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,867
I took care of her.

448
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:38,067
You're sure?

449
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:41,601
I'm not sure, Zach.

450
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:42,867
I don't know how well it worked.

451
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:44,768
I'm not as strong as Damon.

452
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,100
So what happens if it doesn't work?

453
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,534
I don't know.

454
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,601
I'll deal with it.

455
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,100
Is she worth it?

456
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:53,167
Uncle Stefan, this girl you came back for.

457
00:22:57,768 --> 00:23:00,067
Vickie, what are you doing here?

458
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:02,234
Fighting with Robert about my schedule.

459
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:04,534
You'd think getting ripped up by a rabid animal

460
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:07,301
would merit an extra sick day.
Are you feeling ok?

461
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:08,601
I hurt.

462
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:09,933
Well, the doctor gave you something, right?

463
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,367
The kid stuff.

464
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:12,668
Nothing with an "o" in it.

465
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:15,467
I think they were onto me.

466
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:18,701
Here. Knock yourself out, literally.

467
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:21,000
Thanks, Jer.

468
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,467
So you gonna, uh, watch the comet later?

469
00:23:25,534 --> 00:23:28,401
I hadn't really thought about it.

470
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,634
But I could be talked into it.

471
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,734
I'll meet you out there in a few.

472
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,867
Hey, Vick. How you feeling?

473
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:37,434
Like you care.

474
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,734
What are you lookin' at, Gilbert?

475
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:53,933
Hey, I got some candles.

476
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,401
Hi.

477
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,601
Hey.
Hey.

478
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,768
Thank you.

479
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,067
You're welcome.

480
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,601
Thank you.

481
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:17,334
Hi.

482
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:19,434
Hi.

483
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:44,967
You know, that comet...

484
00:24:45,034 --> 00:24:49,301
it's been traveling across
space for thousands of years.

485
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,267
All alone.

486
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:56,734
Yeah, Bonnie says it's a harbinger of evil.

487
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,401
I think it's just a ball of...

488
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:01,734
snow and ice,

489
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,200
trapped on a path that it can't escape.

490
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:06,534
And once every 145 years,

491
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:08,434
it gets to come home.

492
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:15,800
I'm sorry about yesterday.

493
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:18,867
I wasn't myself.

494
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:22,867
You seem to spend a lot of time apologizing.

495
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:27,501
Well, I have a lot to apologize for.

496
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,267
Yesterday, that wasn't about you, ok?

497
00:25:31,334 --> 00:25:34,768
You didn't tell me that you had a brother.

498
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,167
We're not close.

499
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,267
It's, uh...

500
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:39,567
it's complicated.

501
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:42,167
Always.

502
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:51,501
He told me about your ex, Catherine.

503
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:54,134
What did he say?

504
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,900
That she broke your heart.

505
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:03,401
That was a long time ago.

506
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:07,634
When you lose someone, it stays with you,

507
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:10,833
always reminding you of how easy it is to get hurt.

508
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:19,467
Elena...

509
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:20,933
It's ok, Stefan.

510
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,800
I get it.

511
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:25,967
You have no idea how much I get it.

512
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:28,933
Complicated brother? Check.

513
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,434
Complicated ex? Check.

514
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,900
Too complicated to even contemplate
dating, double check.

515
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,134
It's ok.

516
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,833
We met, and we talked,

517
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,467
and it was epic, but...

518
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:46,467
then the sun came up and reality set in

519
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,601
so...

520
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:16,000
I know you.

521
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,768
Well, that's unfortunate.

522
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,200
Um...

523
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,100
I don't... I don't know how,

524
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,534
but...

525
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:28,100
your face.

526
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,800
Excuse me. Sorry.

527
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:52,717
Hey, has anyone seen Vickie?

528
00:27:52,783 --> 00:27:53,717
You're her stalker. You tell us.

529
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:55,284
I can't find her.

530
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:56,518
She probably found somebody else to party with.

531
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:58,584
Sorry, pill pusher, I guess you've been replaced.

532
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,050
What's with the pill pusher?

533
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:02,017
Ask him. You wanna do this right now?

534
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:03,351
Are you dealing?

535
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,017
She's never gonna go for you.

536
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,217
She already did.

537
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,417
Over and over and over again.

538
00:28:08,484 --> 00:28:09,518
Yeah, right.

539
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:11,484
You slept with Vickie Donovan?

540
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:13,783
I mean, Vickie Donovan slept with you?

541
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,117
There's no way.

542
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:17,551
And I didn't even have to force her into it.

543
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:18,984
What the hell is he talking about, Todd?

544
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,584
Nothing, man, just ignore him, he's a punk.

545
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,551
You know what, how about all of you shut up

546
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,217
and help me find my sister?
We'll check the back.

547
00:28:25,284 --> 00:28:26,917
I'll check the square. I'll come with you.

548
00:28:26,984 --> 00:28:28,251
Oh, no, no, no.

549
00:28:28,317 --> 00:28:31,017
You are coming with me.

550
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,650
So that's your game now, dealing?

551
00:28:33,717 --> 00:28:36,284
I'm not dealing.
Look, I'm sick

552
00:28:36,351 --> 00:28:38,417
of the tough love speech, Jer.
It's really having no impact.

553
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,384
You and Jenna, between the two of you...

554
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:41,850
We can stop if you want.

555
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:44,384
Send you to a therapist where
you'll be forced to deal with it

556
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:46,351
or to rehab where you'll sit in group

557
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:49,783
and tell some stranger how
you let your life fall apart.

558
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,984
Or you could talk to me.

559
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,484
I vote for none of the above.

560
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:03,050
Hey.

561
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,050
Hey.

562
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,518
Have you seen my sister?

563
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:07,284
No, sorry. I can't find her.

564
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:08,884
She's missing.

565
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:12,584
I'll keep an eye out for her.

566
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,251
Hey.

567
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,917
I saw you at the hospital yesterday.

568
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:21,184
Did you?

569
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:23,984
What were you doing there?

570
00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:27,151
Visiting.

571
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:29,650
Visiting?

572
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:33,351
You know,

573
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:36,284
Elena and I, we've known
each other for a long time.

574
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:38,484
We might not be together right now,

575
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:40,683
but I look out for her.

576
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,984
And I'll always look out for her.

577
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,783
You really have to stop screaming.

578
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,884
No, please, stop. Don't...

579
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,683
Shh. I got you.

580
00:29:52,518 --> 00:29:53,683
Excuse me.

581
00:29:59,884 --> 00:30:02,084
No! No!

582
00:30:02,151 --> 00:30:04,884
I gotta do it. I'm not gonna drop you.

583
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:09,817
Not bad.

584
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:11,717
Have you been eating bunnies?

585
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:13,050
Let her go.

586
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:15,017
Shh. really?

587
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:16,017
Ok.

588
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:17,317
No! No, no, no!

589
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:18,317
Uhh!

590
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:20,050
Relax.

591
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:21,783
What's happening?

592
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,484
I don't need her to be dead, but...

593
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:26,783
you might.

594
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:32,184
What attacked you the other night?

595
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:37,117
I don't know. An animal.

596
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:38,551
Are you sure about that?

597
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:39,950
Think.

598
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:43,484
Think about it. Think really hard.

599
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:46,518
What attacked you?

600
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,284
A vampire.

601
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:53,984
Who did this to you?
You did!

602
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,117
Wrong!
Don't.

603
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:56,817
It was Stefan. Don't.

604
00:30:56,884 --> 00:30:58,917
Come here.

605
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:05,184
Stefan Salvatore did this to you.

606
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:07,151
Stefan Salvatore did this to me.

607
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:08,384
He's a vampire.

608
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:10,484
A vicious, murderous monster.

609
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:13,317
Please, Damon. Please don't do this.

610
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:15,017
If you couldn't fix it before,

611
00:31:15,084 --> 00:31:17,484
I don't know what you can do now.

612
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,284
Aah!

613
00:31:22,518 --> 00:31:23,783
Uhh!

614
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,451
Your choice of lifestyle

615
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:29,750
has made you weak.

616
00:31:29,817 --> 00:31:32,518
A couple of vampire parlor tricks

617
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:35,384
is nothing compared to the
power that you cod have,

618
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:38,618
that you now need.

619
00:31:39,451 --> 00:31:42,017
But you can change that.

620
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:44,484
Human blood gives you that.

621
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:47,317
No!

622
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:50,884
You have two choices.

623
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,817
You can feed and make her forget.

624
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,917
Or you can let her run, screaming
"vampire" through the town square.

625
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,151
That's what this is about?

626
00:32:01,217 --> 00:32:03,284
You want to expose me?

627
00:32:03,351 --> 00:32:05,917
No! I want you to remember who you are!

628
00:32:05,984 --> 00:32:07,683
Why? So what, so I'll feed?

629
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,251
So I'll kill?

630
00:32:09,317 --> 00:32:13,117
So I'll remember what it's like to be brothers again?

631
00:32:14,618 --> 00:32:15,683
You know what, let her go.

632
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,850
Let her tell everyone that vampires

633
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,850
have returned to Mystic Falls.

634
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:23,317
Let them chain me up,

635
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,750
and let them drive a stake through my heart,

636
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:29,184
because at least I'll be free of you.

637
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:32,151
Huh.

638
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:36,317
Huh.

639
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:38,484
Wow.

640
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:39,783
Come here, sweetheart.

641
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,251
No! It's ok.

642
00:33:01,484 --> 00:33:03,251
What happened?

643
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:05,351
Where am I?

644
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,817
Oh, I ripped my stitches open.

645
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:10,384
Ah...

646
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:11,650
You ok?

647
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:13,584
I took some pills, man.

648
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,050
I'm good.

649
00:33:19,884 --> 00:33:22,417
It's good to be home.

650
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:25,084
Think I might stay a while.

651
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:26,850
This town could use a bit of a wake-up call,

652
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,683
don't you think?

653
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,451
What are you up to, Damon?

654
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:35,584
That's for me to know and for you to... dot dot dot.

655
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,950
Give Elena my best.

656
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,634
She said you found her wandering around.

657
00:33:57,701 --> 00:33:59,734
Yeah.

658
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,134
So, um,

659
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,367
thanks.

660
00:34:05,634 --> 00:34:09,000
Uhh, it's just so much drama.

661
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:10,768
Ever notice how the druggies

662
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,534
are the biggest attention whores?

663
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:14,167
Yeah.

664
00:34:14,234 --> 00:34:15,734
Excuse me. hi.

665
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,734
Hi. Um, have you guys seen Elena?

666
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,167
I think she went home.

667
00:34:21,634 --> 00:34:23,768
I'm gonna give you

668
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,334
Elena's cell number and her email.

669
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:28,567
She is big on texting,

670
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,534
and you can tell her...

671
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,833
I said so.

672
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,000
Thank you.

673
00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:41,601
You ok?

674
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:44,267
What happened to you?

675
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,501
That's so rude.

676
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,734
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

677
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,967
Yeah, she kind of wigs out.

678
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:55,867
It's like her thing.

679
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:01,668
Jer?

680
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:04,000
N, it's me, the hypocrite patrol.

681
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:05,867
What are you doing?

682
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
I've become my worst nightmare.

683
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,701
The authority figure

684
00:35:10,768 --> 00:35:15,134
who has to violate a 15-year-old's privacy.

685
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,534
Jackpot.

686
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:20,000
I see the hiding places ven't
gotten any more creative.

687
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:23,000
What brought
this on?

688
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:26,301
Your ass-hat of a history teacher
shamed me good yesterday.

689
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:29,467
You got tannered. Been there.

690
00:35:29,534 --> 00:35:33,034
"Discover the impossible, Ms. Summers." Got it.

691
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,401
Thanks. Like I didn't know I was screwing up.

692
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,601
You're not screwing up, aunt Jenna.

693
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,301
Yes, I am.

694
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:40,467
You know why?

695
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:42,634
Because I'm not her.

696
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:44,867
She made everything look so easy.

697
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:48,367
You know, high school, marriage, having you.

698
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:53,401
I can't do it.

699
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,501
I'm gonna say or do the wrong thing,

700
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:58,867
and he's gonna get worse,
and it's gonna be my fault.

701
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,000
It's impossible.

702
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,501
This is just the fear talking.

703
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:14,634
You're a little scared,

704
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:17,067
that's all.

705
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:21,100
We all are.

706
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:29,401
I have to go do something.

707
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:33,501
But are you going to be ok?

708
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,401
Oh... whoo.

709
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:56,933
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

710
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,668
No, it's fine.

711
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:03,668
Um... I was hoping I'd see you again.

712
00:38:03,734 --> 00:38:05,634
I know.

713
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:09,467
Cocky much?

714
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:12,434
Very much.

715
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:22,868
Hi.

716
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,667
Hey.

717
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:29,401
* Something always brings me back to you *

718
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:32,134
Would you like to come in?

719
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,534
* You never take... *

720
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:36,434
The comet's actually this way.

721
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:41,534
* No matter what I say or do *

722
00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:44,234
* Still feel you here *

723
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,967
* Till the moment I'm gone *

724
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,601
Sorry for barging in.

725
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,334
Especially after earlier.

726
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:56,534
No, no. I'm glad you're here.

727
00:38:56,601 --> 00:39:02,067
The way we left things... I didn't like it.

728
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,634
See, the thing is,

729
00:39:05,701 --> 00:39:09,401
I got home tonight planning on doing what I always do,

730
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:11,401
write in my diary,

731
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:15,701
like I have been since my mom
gave me one when I was 10.

732
00:39:15,768 --> 00:39:17,834
It's where I get everything out, everything I'm feeling.

733
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,467
It all goes in this little book

734
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:21,601
that I hide on the second shelf

735
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:24,701
behind this really hideous ceramic mermaid.

736
00:39:24,768 --> 00:39:28,100
But then I realized that I'd just be writing things

737
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:31,000
that I should probably be telling you.

738
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:34,401
What would you write?

739
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:39,033
I would write...

740
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:42,801
"Dear diary,

741
00:39:42,868 --> 00:39:46,401
today I convinced myself it was ok to give up.

742
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,367
Don't take risks.

743
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:49,701
Stick with the status quo.

744
00:39:49,768 --> 00:39:52,933
No drama, now is just not the time.

745
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,401
But my reasons aren't reasons, they're excuses.

746
00:39:56,467 --> 00:40:00,067
All I'm doing is hiding from the truth,

747
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:02,868
and the truth is that..."

748
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,367
* Set me free *

749
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:06,868
I'm scared, Stefan.

750
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:10,167
I'm scared that if I let myself

751
00:40:10,234 --> 00:40:12,634
be happy for even one moment that...

752
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,734
the world's just going to come crashing down,

753
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:16,134
and I...

754
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,701
I don't know if I can survive that.

755
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:20,801
* so talk *

756
00:40:20,868 --> 00:40:25,801
Do you want to know what I would write?

757
00:40:25,868 --> 00:40:27,801
* But you're onto me *

758
00:40:27,868 --> 00:40:31,868
"I met a girl.

759
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:33,701
We talked.

760
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:36,067
It was epic."

761
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,234
* I live here on my knees *

762
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,234
"But then the sun came up and reality set in."

763
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,100
* Everything I think need here on the... *

764
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:47,900
"Well, this is reality.

765
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,501
Right here."

766
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:52,467
*I can't seem to let you go *

767
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,167
* The one thing that I still know *

768
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:57,267
* Is that you're keeping me *

769
00:40:57,334 --> 00:41:05,667
* down *

770
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:09,834
* ooh *

771
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:16,200
* You're keeping me down *

772
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:18,967
* yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

773
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:24,601
* You're onto me *

774
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:26,134
* Onto me *

775
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,501
*All over *

776
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:37,933
Aah!

1
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:13,145
Good morning.

2
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:14,347
Please...

3
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:15,283
Don't.

4
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,717
Don't do that.

5
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:22,656
Ah, ah, ah.

6
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:25,325
No! No!

7
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:26,726
No!

8
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:29,429
Get away from me! No!

9
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,665
This could have gone a completely different way.

10
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,890
I'm not saying don't date the guy.

11
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,558
I'm just saying take it slow.

12
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:00,360
You were the one who said to go for it.

13
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:02,662
Now I'm saying take it slow.

14
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,130
Why the about-face?

15
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:05,565
It's not an about-face.

16
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:06,800
You're single for the first time

17
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:07,968
In your entire high school career.

18
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:09,602
It's the perfect time to play the field.

19
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,339
Oh, because I'm so that girl.

20
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:14,174
Seriously, what are you not saying?

21
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:15,375
It's stupid.

22
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:16,576
Bonnie...

23
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:18,111
What?
Spit it out.

24
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:20,780
I accidentally touched Stefan

25
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:24,351
And got a really bad feeling.

26
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:25,585
Is that it?

27
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:26,720
Bonnie.

28
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:28,455
It was bad bad!

29
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:30,056
Is the whole witch mojo thing again?

30
00:03:30,124 --> 00:03:32,225
You know what? I'm just concerned.

31
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:33,526
This is me expressing concern

32
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:35,161
About my best friend's new boyfriend.

33
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:38,898
And I love you for it, I do.

34
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:40,467
But I feel good.

35
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,602
It's been a hard year,

36
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,871
and I'm starting to kind of feel like

37
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,506
things are getting back to normal again.

38
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:49,743
And you know what? Stefan is a big part of that.

39
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:56,850
I rock. I scored 2 tickets

40
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:58,118
to the Posers Saturday night.

41
00:03:58,185 --> 00:03:59,586
They're playing at the rat.

42
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,588
You and tyler have fun.

43
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,456
Don't be like that.

44
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:05,358
Come on. I want you to go.

45
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:06,760
You're not worried everyone's going to know

46
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,128
you're screwing the stoner geek?

47
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:09,996
Oh, wait... everyone already knows.

48
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:11,898
Yeah. But it's not like that anymore,

49
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:15,268
so now we can be friends and just hang.

50
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:16,736
Tell me something, was it the drugs?

51
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:19,372
Were you sleeping with me because of the drugs?

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,107
Screw you.

53
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:22,308
No, if there's another reason,

54
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:24,010
please, I'm all ears.

55
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:32,152
Good morning, Elena.

56
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:33,553
Good morning, Bonnie.

57
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,321
Hey, um, I gotta find Caroline.

58
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:36,656
She's not answering her phone.

59
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:38,391
So I'll see you guys later.

60
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:39,626
Bonnie, wait...

61
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:45,265
She doesn't like me very much.

62
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,267
She doesn't know you.

63
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:49,536
She's my best friend. She's just looking out for me.

64
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:51,404
But when she does,

65
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:53,807
she will love you.

66
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:54,741
Look... 

67
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:56,743
there's Elena and her new boyfriend.

68
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:58,778
Now, what are they doing?

69
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:00,647
Oh, they're walking,

70
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:02,849
walking, walking.

71
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,417
Yep. Right into the sunset.

72
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:05,885
You're a dick.

73
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:07,487
While you just stand there
looking like one of those

74
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:08,822
little yard trolls.

75
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:10,356
Gnomes.

76
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:12,492
Here's what we're going to do.

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,194
Are you free tonight?

78
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,330
Yes.
Perfect.

79
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:19,032
Dinner, my house. 8:00.

80
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,433
You, me, and Bonnie.

81
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:22,335
You two will spend some quality time

82
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:23,970
and she'll get to see what a great guy you are.

83
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:25,638
Mission accomplished.

84
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,508
Hey, what am I supposed to do, Ty?

85
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:30,410
She made her choice.

86
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:32,846
Let her know she made the wrong one.

87
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:34,047
What are you doing?

88
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,915
Ty, don't.
Ty, don't!

89
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:37,951
Ty! Don't!

90
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:56,936
That throw was insane.

91
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,571
I didn't know you played football.

92
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,939
I used to. It was a long time ago.

93
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,809
So why don't you try out for the team?

94
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:06,378
Yeah, I don't think so.

95
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,947
So you don't like football?

96
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:11,116
No, I love football. I think it's a great sport.

97
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:12,985
But in this case,

98
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:15,654
I don't think football likes me.

99
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:18,290
You saw Tyler over there,

100
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:19,458
and we both know how Matt feels.

101
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:20,726
They don't know you.

102
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:23,195
To them, you're mysterious loner guy.

103
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:25,064
Wouldn't hurt to be part of.

104
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:26,799
Make some friends.
Says the girl

105
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,668
who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.

106
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:33,072
Hey, come on. There's more to me than just

107
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,074
gloomy graveyard girl.

108
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:38,210
There's a whole other Elena
that you have yet to meet.

109
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:39,611
She was into everything, very busy.

110
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,246
Well, I look forward to meeting her.

111
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,748
And when will that be?

112
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,216
Soon.

113
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:46,985
She's working on it.

114
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:49,722
World war II ended in...

115
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:55,961
Anyone got anything?

116
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,097
Miss Juan? 1945.

117
00:06:58,164 --> 00:06:59,932
Psst. Fyi... 

118
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,034
Our team sucks. They could use you.

119
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:04,136
Can't.
Pearl Harbor.

120
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:05,637
I'm a loner.

121
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:06,939
Miss Gilbert?

122
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:09,007
Hmm? Pearl Harbor?

123
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:10,342
Um...

124
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,412
December 7, 1941.

125
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,748
Thank you, Miss Gilbert.

126
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:18,717
Anytime.

127
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:20,319
Very well.

128
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:21,987
The fall of the Berlin wall.

129
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:23,255
1989.

130
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:25,257
I'm good with dates, sir.

131
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:26,759
Are you?

132
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:28,727
How good?

133
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:31,830
Keep it to the year.

134
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:33,031
Civil Rights Act.

135
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,467
1964.

136
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,704
John F. Kennedy assassination.

137
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:39,671
1963.

138
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:42,341
Martin luther King.
'68.

139
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,009
Lincoln.
1865.

140
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,111
Roe vs. Wade.
1973.

141
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,179
Brown vs. Board.

142
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:48,213
1954.

143
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:49,248
The battle of Gettysburg.

144
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:50,449
1863.

145
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:51,450
Korean war.

146
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,018
1950 to 1953.

147
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:55,554
Ha! It ended in '52.

148
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:58,824
Uh, actually, sir,

149
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:00,993
it was '53.

150
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,966
Look it up, somebody.

151
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:09,034
Quickly.

152
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:12,104
It was 19... 53.

153
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:25,484
How did you know all of that?

154
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:28,320
Years and years of crossword puzzles.

155
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:31,489
It's a loner thing.

156
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:37,329
Nice job! Nice job!

157
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:40,231
Mr. Lockwood, is there
anything you're good at?

158
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,666
'Cause it isn't history,

159
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:44,102
and it sure as hell isn't defending the ball!

160
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,303
Yes, coach.

161
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:46,604
Now do it again!

162
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:12,163
Oh, my God! You're here!

163
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,500
Yep. I can't be sad girl forever.

164
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:17,135
The only way to get things back to the way they were

165
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:18,536
are to do things that were.

166
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:20,872
Oh, and you're coming to dinner tonight.

167
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,207
I am?
Mm-hmm.

168
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:24,809
You and me and Stefan.

169
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:26,277
You have to give him
a chance.

170
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:28,646
Tonight's no good.

171
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:30,215
Have you seen caroline?

172
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:31,649
I texted her like a hundred times.

173
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:33,918
Don't change the subject, Bonnie Bennett.

174
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:35,387
You're going to be there.

175
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:38,323
Fine. I'll go.

176
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:39,524
Good.

177
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,459
Varsity trials were last spring, Mr. Salvatore.

178
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:42,827
I wasn't
here then, sir.

179
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:45,263
And you're not here now, as far as I'm concerned.

180
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:48,466
Mr. Tanner, I realize that you and I

181
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:49,934
didn't get off to the best start,

182
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:52,570
And I want to apologize for that.

183
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:54,406
I've played football before.

184
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:57,041
Wide receiver, mostly, and I'm pretty good.

185
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,813
Well, I won't be asking you
who won the super bowl in '71.

186
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,481
'71 was the...

187
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:07,152
Sorry. I... I understand that, sir.

188
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:10,522
Just to see you get knocked on your ass.

189
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,924
Borrow some gear.

190
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:14,325
Go!

191
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:17,162
Before I change my mind. Let's run it again!

192
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:21,666
First my girlfriend, now the team?

193
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:23,802
Dude, this is an opportunity.

194
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:25,737
Football's a contact sport.

195
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,572
Sometimes people get hurt.

196
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,441
Whoo!

197
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:30,575
Ha ha!

198
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:32,043
Seriously, where is caroline?

199
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:35,079
I don't know. It's not like her.

200
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:36,648
Try her again.

201
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:43,922
Uh...

202
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:45,857
Oh, my God.

203
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:49,994
That must be the mystery guy from the grill.

204
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:52,297
That's not a mystery guy.

205
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:53,631
That's Damon Salvatore.

206
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,967
Salvatore, as in Stefan?

207
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,172
I got the other brother.

208
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,407
Hope you don't mind.

209
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:03,075
Sorry I'm late, girls.

210
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:04,844
I, uh, was busy.

211
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:07,946
All right, let's start with the
double pike herkey hurdler,

212
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:09,948
what do you say?

213
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:18,569
And 5, 6, 7, 8.

214
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,037
1, 2, 3, 4,

215
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,939
5, 6, 7, 8.

216
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:23,841
1, 2, 3, 4,

217
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:25,443
5, 6, 7, 8.

218
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:28,146
Elena, sweetie, why don't you just observe today?

219
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:30,114
Ok?

220
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:32,416
Keep going! Ok. Do it again from the top.

221
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,786
And 5, 6, 7, 8.

222
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:37,321
1, 2, 3, 4,

223
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:38,856
5, 6, 7, 8.

224
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:41,459
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

225
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:42,827
7, 8.

226
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:43,961
Blue lady!

227
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,964
Blue lady!

228
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:49,300
Set, hut! Go!

229
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,906
Come on, Tyler, cover it!

230
00:11:57,776 --> 00:11:59,143
Let's do it.

231
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:00,378
Get it.

232
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,716
Line up!

233
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:58,969
I hate to say it, but he's got skills.

234
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:00,738
I think he needs a buddy pass.

235
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:02,339
Really?

236
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,041
You don't get to walk on the field

237
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:06,477
And act like you own the place after 5 minutes.

238
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,412
Just hang one up there
and I'll take care of the rest.

239
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,346
Do it again.

240
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,583
All right, let's huddle up.

241
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,084
Set, hut!

242
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:21,892
Oh!

243
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:24,561
Whoo!

244
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,797
Welcome to the team, buddy.

245
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:29,433
Let's go.

246
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,901
You gonna live, Salvatore?

247
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:32,936
Yeah.

248
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:34,471
Walk it off, son.

249
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,208
Hey. That was my bad.

250
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,310
It's all right.

251
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:42,312
Hey.

252
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,881
All right.

253
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:01,932
How were tryouts?

254
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:05,135
Did you make the team?

255
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:10,373
Very Emerson, the way you reveal
your soul with so many... 

256
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:11,741
Adjectives.

257
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:14,945
What are you doing here?

258
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:19,583
I've come to apologize.

259
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,184
I've been doing some thinking,

260
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:24,721
some soul searching, and...

261
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:26,923
I want us to start over.

262
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,993
We need to put the past behind us.

263
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:31,895
You're my little brother,

264
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:34,264
and if you want to live

265
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,900
a normal, happy human life,

266
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:39,069
Then I want that for you.

267
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:41,138
Maybe I can do it, too.

268
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:43,907
That I can learn to be a non-living

269
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:47,010
living person.

270
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:50,380
Maybe there's hope for both of us.

271
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,926
You know, it doesn't have to be this way, Damon.

272
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:04,494
Of course it doesn't.

273
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:07,898
I saw Elena today, btw.

274
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:09,099
That means "by the way."

275
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,101
She was at cheerleading practice.

276
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:16,206
She looked so perky in her little short shorts.

277
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:17,741
Just...

278
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:20,810
simmer down, I didn't even go near her.

279
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,013
I've got my own cheerleader now.

280
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,447
Ooh, that reminds me... 

281
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,216
I gotta run. I have a date.

282
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:28,318
Sweaty palms.

283
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,886
Wish me luck.

284
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,226
You explain it.

285
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:37,494
Last night, I'm watching Nine-o,

286
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,629
a commercial breaks come on and I'm like,

287
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:41,531
I bet it's that phone commercial. And sure enough,

288
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,500
it's that guy and the girl with the bench,

289
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,702
he flies to Paris and he flies back.

290
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,737
They take a picture. Oh, come on.

291
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:49,172
That commercial's on a constant loop.

292
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,540
Fine.

293
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:51,608
Well, how about this?

294
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:54,311
Today I'm obsessed with numbers.

295
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:58,448
3 numbers. I keep seeing 8, 14, and 22.

296
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:00,984
How weird is that?

297
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:04,454
Maybe we should play the lottery.

298
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:06,089
Have you talked to your grams?

299
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:08,758
She's just gonna say it's because I'm a witch.

300
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:10,660
I don't want to be a witch. Do you want to be a witch?

301
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:12,095
I don't want to be a witch.

302
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:13,597
And putting it in a nice bowl

303
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,198
isn't fooling anybody.

304
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,499
Ok, serving spoons.

305
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,201
Where are the serving spoons?

306
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,437
Little drawer on your left.

307
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:32,816
Ok, so you've been in this
kitchen like a thousand times.

308
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:35,185
Yeah, that's it.

309
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:37,153
Ok, he's here.

310
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:40,423
Don't be nervous. Just be your normal loving self.

311
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:47,998
Birthday candles.

312
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,783
Did tanner give you a hard time today?

313
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:08,718
Well, he let me on the team,

314
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:11,087
so I must have done something right.

315
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:13,923
Bonnie, you should have seen Stefan today.

316
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,458
Tyler threw a ball right at him, and... 

317
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:16,993
Yeah, I heard.

318
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:26,803
Why don't you tell Stefan about your family?

319
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:30,273
Um, divorced. No mom. Live with my dad.

320
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,641
Hmm.

321
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:33,677
No, about the witches.

322
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:36,046
Bonnie's family has a lineage of witches.

323
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:37,447
It's really cool.

324
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,848
Cool isn't the word I'd use.

325
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,052
Well, it's certainly interesting.

326
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm not too versed,

327
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:45,422
But I do know that there's

328
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:47,290
A history of celtic druids

329
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,259
that migrated here in the 1800s.

330
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:50,927
My family came by way of Salem.

331
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:52,062
Really?

332
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:54,331
Salem witches?

333
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:55,565
Yeah.

334
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:57,500
I would say that's pretty cool.

335
00:17:57,568 --> 00:18:00,337
Really? Why?

336
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:03,306
Salem witches are heroic examples

337
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,009
of individualism

338
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:07,744
and nonconformity.

339
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:10,980
Yeah, they are.

340
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:17,454
I wonder who that could be.

341
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,192
Surprise!

342
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:23,360
Bonnie said you were doing dinner,

343
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:24,627
so we brought dessert.

344
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:27,831
Oh. Hope you don't mind.

345
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,468
What are you doing here?

346
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:34,371
Waiting for Elena to invite me in.

347
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:35,572
Oh, yeah, you can... 
No, no, no.

348
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:37,273
He can't, uh...

349
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:39,609
he can't stay.

350
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:42,879
Can you, Damon?

351
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:46,149
Get in here.

352
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:48,985
We're just... finishing up.

353
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:51,054
It's fine. Just come on in.

354
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:02,832
You have a beautiful home, Elena.

355
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,868
Thank you.

356
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:11,869
I cannot believe that Mr. Tanner let you on the team.

357
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,870
Tyler must be ceiling.

358
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:15,766
But good for you. Go for it.

359
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,368
That's what I always tell him. You have to engage.

360
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,437
You can't just sit there and
wait for life to come to you.

361
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:21,538
You have to go get it.

362
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:23,607
Yeah, Elena wasn't so lucky today.

363
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:25,208
It's only because you missed summer camp.

364
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:27,044
God, I don't know how you're ever
going to learn the routines.

365
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:29,446
I'll work with her. She'll get it.

366
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:30,881
I guess we can put her in the back.

367
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:33,850
You know, you don't seem like

368
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:35,519
the cheerleader type, Elena.

369
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:37,521
Oh, it's just 'cause her parents died.

370
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:38,955
Yeah, I mean, she's just

371
00:19:39,023 --> 00:19:40,624
totally going through a blah phase.

372
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:44,695
She used to be way more fun.

373
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:48,498
And I say that with complete sensitivity.

374
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:50,467
I'm sorry, Elena.

375
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:52,903
I know what it's like to lose both your parents.

376
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,772
In fact, Stefan and I have watched
almost every single person

377
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,574
we've ever cared about die.

378
00:19:57,642 --> 00:19:59,743
We don't need to get into that right now, Damon.

379
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:02,145
Oh, you know what, you're right, Stef. I'm sorry.

380
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:05,282
The last thing I wanted to do was bring her up.

381
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:11,088
Mmm.

382
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:12,589
Don't do that.

383
00:20:12,657 --> 00:20:14,524
Not while I'm working.

384
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:19,096
I'll see you later.

385
00:20:19,163 --> 00:20:20,897
I'll be right back.

386
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:31,174
She's my sister and I love her,

387
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:34,878
but sometimes she can
really make you work for it.

388
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:37,714
I find it pretty easy.

389
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,625
All right, I get it. Hitting me to impress her. That's... 

390
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:49,659
That's real nice.

391
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:51,928
I don't need to impress her.

392
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:53,964
I already won.

393
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,467
Now you're dead.
Am I? 'Cause it seems like

394
00:20:57,535 --> 00:20:59,536
I'm standing here waiting for you to man up.

395
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:02,038
Ty, don't!

396
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:03,573
The next time I see you, gilbert...

397
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:05,108
No, next time I see you.

398
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:12,716
What are you doin', Vick?

399
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:16,787
One more.

400
00:21:16,854 --> 00:21:19,589
Oh, thank you.

401
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:25,261
Nice save.

402
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:27,163
I like you.

403
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,098
You know how to laugh.

404
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,199
And you make Stefan smile,

405
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:31,067
which is something I haven't seen

406
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:32,550
in a very long time.

407
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:38,408
Earlier, did you mean... Katherine?

408
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:40,443
Mm-hmm.

409
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:43,329
How did she die?

410
00:21:44,364 --> 00:21:46,999
In a fire. Tragic fire.

411
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,334
Recently?

412
00:21:48,402 --> 00:21:51,170
Well, it seems like it was yesterday.

413
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,708
What was she like?

414
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,545
She was beautiful.

415
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:01,480
A lot like you in that department.

416
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:04,350
She was just very complicated

417
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:06,352
and selfish and at times not very kind,

418
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,820
but very sexy and seductive.

419
00:22:07,888 --> 00:22:12,058
So which one of you dated her first?

420
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:17,830
Nicely deduced.

421
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:19,565
Ask Stefan.

422
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:21,901
I'm sure his answer differs from mine.

423
00:22:31,344 --> 00:22:33,946
I'd quit cheerleading if I were you.

424
00:22:34,014 --> 00:22:35,648
Why do you say that?

425
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:38,651
Oh, I saw you at practice. You looked miserable.

426
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,852
You saw that?

427
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,153
Uh-huh.

428
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:44,457
I used to love it. It was fun.

429
00:22:44,524 --> 00:22:46,392
Things are different this year.

430
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,227
Everything that used to matter doesn't anymore.

431
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:49,361
So don't let it.

432
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:50,830
Quit, move on. Problem solved.

433
00:22:50,897 --> 00:22:51,964
Ta-da.

434
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,201
Some things could matter again.

435
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:56,736
Maybe.

436
00:22:56,803 --> 00:23:01,307
But... seems a little unrealistic to me.

437
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:08,481
I'm sorry.

438
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,917
About Katherine.

439
00:23:13,987 --> 00:23:15,955
You lost her, too.

440
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:21,293
Hey.

441
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:22,361
Need some help?

442
00:23:23,797 --> 00:23:25,397
Sure, why not?

443
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:29,101
Matt tries, but he's just having a really hard time.

444
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:31,170
You have to understand that

445
00:23:31,238 --> 00:23:32,471
they were each other's first.

446
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:34,807
You know, like, from the sandbox.

447
00:23:38,478 --> 00:23:40,579
That's a really nice scarf.

448
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:42,481
Mm. Thank you, it's new.

449
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:43,549
Can I see it?

450
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:47,019
I mean, would you mind taking it off?

451
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:48,387
Oh, I can't.

452
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:51,457
Why not? You ok?

453
00:23:52,425 --> 00:23:53,759
Um...

454
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:57,129
All I know is that I can't take it off.

455
00:23:57,197 --> 00:24:00,299
What are you two kids talking about?

456
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,168
I was just commenting on her scarf.

457
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:04,470
Hmm. Hey, you know, um,

458
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:06,472
Elena and Bonnie are finishing up the dishes.

459
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,274
Why don't you go see if you can help?

460
00:24:08,341 --> 00:24:10,943
Does it look like I do dishes?

461
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:13,712
For me?

462
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,315
Hmm... I don't think so.

463
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:24,457
Go see if Elena needs help in the kitchen.

464
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:26,192
You know what?

465
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:28,727
I'm gonna go see if Elena needs
some help in the kitchen.

466
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:31,297
Great.

467
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:41,040
They are people, Damon.

468
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:42,541
She's not a puppet.

469
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,176
She doesn't exist for your amusement,

470
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:45,911
for you to feed on whenever you want to.

471
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:47,313
Sure she does.

472
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,347
They all do.

473
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:50,015
They're whatever I want them to be.

474
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,617
They're mine for the taking.

475
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:53,118
All right, you've had your fun.

476
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:55,054
You used Caroline, you got to me and Elena,

477
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:56,188
good for you.

478
00:24:56,256 --> 00:24:57,823
Now it's time for you to go.

479
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:00,526
That's not a problem.

480
00:25:00,594 --> 00:25:02,595
Because...

481
00:25:02,662 --> 00:25:04,263
I've been invited in,

482
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:05,865
and I'll come back tomorrow night

483
00:25:05,932 --> 00:25:07,166
and the following night

484
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:10,669
and I'll do with your little cheerleader

485
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:13,038
whatever I want to do.

486
00:25:13,106 --> 00:25:16,575
Because that is what is normal to me.

487
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,850
Tonight wasn't so bad. I had fun.

488
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:26,585
Hmm. That makes one of us.

489
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:28,521
Come on.

490
00:25:28,588 --> 00:25:31,590
Your brother isn't as bad as you make him out to be...

491
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,334
There must be a shred of humanity
left inside my brother.

492
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,736
Somewhere.

493
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:07,638
I keep hoping.

494
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:10,374
But how do I make him see it?

495
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:12,443
And how do I protect her?

496
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,346
Ooh.

497
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:51,315
Look at you. You look hot in your jersey.

498
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:53,217
What happened? No more cheerleader?

499
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:55,085
I quit. I'm a quitter.

500
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:57,788
No, hey, you're not a quitter.

501
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:59,857
You suffered a great loss.
You're not the same person.

502
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:02,860
You should be looking ahead.

503
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:04,094
You should be starting over.

504
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,330
Ok?

505
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:09,567
I hope you don't think this is

506
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:13,070
too soon or too weird, but...

507
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:14,338
I, uh,

508
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:16,207
I wanted you to have this.

509
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,548
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

510
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:26,250
It's something that I've had forever,

511
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:29,854
and, uh, I've never wanted to
give it to anyone until now.

512
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:34,291
I'd very much like it if you'd wear it for me,

513
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:37,261
for... good luck.

514
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:39,864
Is that rose that I smell?

515
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,299
No, it's, uh... it's an herb.

516
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:44,268
It's nice, huh?

517
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:46,237
I love it.

518
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,974
And, uh,

519
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,176
I wanted to thank you

520
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:56,947
for pushing me to try out for the team.

521
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,148
It feels really good.

522
00:28:58,216 --> 00:28:59,383
We're a pair.

523
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:01,452
I quit, you start.

524
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,519
Right. 

525
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:04,955
We're a work in progress.

526
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:07,958
We'll figure it out.

527
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:22,907
And you're not in uniform because...

528
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:52,136
Wait, wait, wait,

529
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:55,406
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

530
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:57,508
Wait. Let's be honest here.

531
00:29:57,575 --> 00:30:00,878
In the past, we used to let other teams

532
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:03,814
come into our town and roll right over us!

533
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:08,786
But that is about to change.

534
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:12,990
We've got some great new talent

535
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:15,159
tonight starting on the offensive line,

536
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:16,794
and I'm gonna tell you right now,

537
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:18,395
it has been a long time

538
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,998
since I have seen a kid like this

539
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,833
with hands like these.

540
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:30,674
This blows.

541
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:32,910
He can't start the guy. He just got here.

542
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:34,211
That have been waiting for us

543
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,580
to put a check in the win column,

544
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:39,316
I have only one thing to say to you... 

545
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:41,652
Your Timberwolves are hungry.

546
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:46,623
Hey, you. What's wrong?

547
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,359
Nothing. And the central high lions

548
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:50,794
are what's for dinner!

549
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:51,929
Is that Jeremy?

550
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:54,298
Wait, no! Ty! No.

551
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:56,233
Oh, what do you care?

552
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:58,102
Don't look so down.

553
00:30:58,169 --> 00:30:59,903
You can have her when I'm done.

554
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:05,576
Tyler, stop it!

555
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:09,980
Tyler! Tyler, stop!

556
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:11,081
Stop it!

557
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:13,083
Stop, you're hurting him!

558
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:14,418
Tyler!

559
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:15,552
Tyler, stop!

560
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:19,390
Tyler!

561
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:20,958
Stop it! Tyler, stop!

562
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:23,427
Hey, he's down! Enough!

563
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:32,870
Jeremy, no!

564
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:36,040
Get off me! Stop!

565
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:38,876
What the hell, Jeremy?

566
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:41,145
Put your head up, you're bleeding.

567
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:42,212
I'm fine!

568
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,414
Yeah, you smell fine.

569
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:45,949
Just stop, ok?

570
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:48,619
Come on, man. Come on.

571
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:50,220
Oh, my God, your hand.

572
00:31:50,288 --> 00:31:51,822
No, no, no, it's fine.

573
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,824
Is it deep? How bad is it?

574
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:55,526
Come on!

575
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,864
But... I saw it, it was... 

576
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:02,232
He missed.

577
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,201
It's not my blood.

578
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,303
See? I'm fine.
No, no, no.

579
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:07,838
I... I saw it. The glass cut your hand. It was... 

580
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:10,941
It's ok. I'm ok.

581
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:13,110
It's almost kick-off time, all right?

582
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:14,144
So, um,

583
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:16,947
I'll, uh, I'll see you after the game.

584
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:26,417
Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly.

585
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:27,785
Can you stand straight, please?

586
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:29,253
Could someone please help Tiki?

587
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:31,155
Hey! Where you been?

588
00:32:31,222 --> 00:32:32,423
Can I ask you a question

589
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,592
And you give me a really serious no-joke response?

590
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,860
Of course. What is it?

591
00:32:36,928 --> 00:32:38,062
The bad mojo.

592
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:40,364
When you touched Stefan
and you had that reaction...

593
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:42,232
You know what, forget I said that.

594
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,201
Your little dinner party plot totally won me over.

595
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:45,669
No, Bonnie, seriously. What was it?

596
00:32:45,737 --> 00:32:47,538
Did you see something,

597
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:49,273
Or...

598
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,242
it wasn't clear like a picture.

599
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,645
Like today, I keep seeing

600
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:55,779
those same numbers I told you about... 

601
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:58,282
8, 14, 22.

602
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,817
Yeah? When I touched Stefan,

603
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:01,285
it was a feeling.

604
00:33:01,353 --> 00:33:05,823
And it vibrated through me,
and it was cold, and it... 

605
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,791
And what?

606
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:09,960
It was death.

607
00:33:10,028 --> 00:33:13,630
It's what I imagine death to be like.

608
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:29,180
You scared me. What are you doing here?

609
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:31,482
I'm hiding from Caroline.

610
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,950
Aand why is that?

611
00:33:33,018 --> 00:33:34,985
I needed a break.

612
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:36,520
She talks more than I can listen.

613
00:33:36,588 --> 00:33:38,622
That could be a sign.

614
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,724
Well, she's awfully young.

615
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:42,626
Not much younger than you are.

616
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:47,730
I don't see it going anywhere in the bigger picture.

617
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:48,732
I think she'd drive me crazy.

618
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,434
Caroline does have

619
00:33:50,502 --> 00:33:51,702
Some really annoying traits,

620
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,237
but we've been friends since the first grade

621
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:54,939
and that means something to me.

622
00:33:55,006 --> 00:33:57,975
Duly noted. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable.

623
00:33:58,043 --> 00:34:00,110
That's not my intention.

624
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:02,046
Yes, it is.

625
00:34:02,113 --> 00:34:05,449
Otherwise you wouldn't
put an alternate meaning

626
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:07,651
behind everything you say.

627
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:12,089
You're right.

628
00:34:12,157 --> 00:34:14,925
I do have other intentions, but so do you.

629
00:34:14,993 --> 00:34:17,061
Really?
Mm-hmm.

630
00:34:17,128 --> 00:34:20,431
I see 'em.

631
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:21,765
You want me.

632
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,067
Excuse me?

633
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:25,769
I get to you. You find yourself drawn to me.

634
00:34:25,837 --> 00:34:27,605
You think about me even when you
don't want to think about me.

635
00:34:27,672 --> 00:34:29,540
I bet you even dreamed about me.

636
00:34:31,576 --> 00:34:32,910
And right now...

637
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:35,913
You want to kiss me.

638
00:34:42,554 --> 00:34:44,021
What the hell?

639
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:46,991
I don't know what game you're
trying to play with Stefan here,

640
00:34:47,058 --> 00:34:49,026
but I don't want to be part of it.

641
00:34:49,094 --> 00:34:50,527
And I don't know what happened in the past,

642
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:52,663
but let's get one thing straight... 

643
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:55,366
I am not Katherine.

644
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,475
You gonna be able to play?

645
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:07,077
Oh, yeah, I'm good.

646
00:35:07,145 --> 00:35:09,647
Uh, what you did back there...

647
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:12,316
you had Jeremy's back.

648
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:14,051
Ah, he's a messed-up kid.

649
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,387
Somebody's gotta look out for him.

650
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:17,621
I know.

651
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:20,824
This week at practice I was a dick.

652
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:22,259
Had your reasons.

653
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:24,261
No excuse.

654
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:30,434
Good luck tonight.

655
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:32,169
We're lucky to have you.

656
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:41,278
Isn't that nice?

657
00:35:41,346 --> 00:35:44,114
Stefan joins a team, makes a friend.

658
00:35:44,182 --> 00:35:47,651
It's all so, "rah, rah, go team, yeah!"

659
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,186
Not tonight.

660
00:35:49,254 --> 00:35:50,621
I'm done with you.

661
00:35:52,257 --> 00:35:54,458
Nice trick with Elena.

662
00:35:54,526 --> 00:35:57,027
Let me guess... vervain in the necklace?

663
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:59,463
I admit, I was a bit surprised.

664
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:02,766
It's been a while since anyone
could resist my compulsion.

665
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:05,202
Where'd you get it?

666
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,137
Does it matter?

667
00:36:07,205 --> 00:36:08,872
Guess I could just seduce
her the old-fashioned way.

668
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,575
Or I could just... eat her.

669
00:36:15,013 --> 00:36:16,413
No.

670
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:18,982
You're not gonna hurt her, Damon.

671
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,818
No?

672
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,619
Because deep down inside,

673
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:24,488
there is a part of you

674
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:25,823
that feels for her.

675
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,759
I was worried that you had no humanity

676
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:30,728
left inside of you,

677
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:33,597
that you may have actually become the monster

678
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:35,265
that you pretend to be.

679
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,201
Who's pretending?
Then kill me.

680
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:40,037
Well, I'm... I'm tempted.

681
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:41,805
No, you're not.

682
00:36:41,873 --> 00:36:42,973
You've had lifetimes to do it,

683
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,509
and yet, here I am. I'm still alive.

684
00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:47,311
And there you are.

685
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:49,980
You're still haunting me.

686
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,851
After 145 years.

687
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:56,253
Katherine is dead.

688
00:36:57,255 --> 00:36:58,589
And you hate me

689
00:36:58,656 --> 00:37:00,657
because you loved her,

690
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:03,994
and you torture me because you still do.

691
00:37:04,062 --> 00:37:07,965
And that, my brother,

692
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:10,367
is your humanity.

693
00:37:11,302 --> 00:37:13,437
Salvatore!

694
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:17,241
What the hell? We've got a game to play!

695
00:37:17,308 --> 00:37:20,511
If that's my humanity...

696
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:22,980
then what's this?

697
00:37:24,883 --> 00:37:26,850
Aah!
No!

698
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:39,373
Anyone, anytime, any place.

699
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:42,442
Tanner's M.I.A. I think he had a little bit too much beer.

700
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,844
Don't talk to me right now,
all right? I'm pissed at you.

701
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:45,412
What's your problem?
What's my... 

702
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,646
You're my problem, all right?

703
00:37:46,714 --> 00:37:47,781
You're a bully.

704
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,349
A freakin' 12-year-old bully, man.

705
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,617
And I'm sick of it.

706
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,185
I mean, what was that about tonight?

707
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:54,287
What's beating up the new guy going to prove?

708
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,323
Or screwing with my sister

709
00:37:56,391 --> 00:37:58,225
or pummeling my girlfriend's kid brother.

710
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:00,560
Girlfriend? Look, I don't know how to tell you this,

711
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:02,295
but she dumped your ass.

712
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,564
Are you for real?! You want to hit me?

713
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:05,966
I'm on your team.

714
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,501
This was over the line.

715
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:09,302
Even for you.

716
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:34,494
Somebody help!

717
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,235
It wasn't just for the drugs.

718
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:04,984
What kind of animal could be doing all this?

719
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:06,986
Why would it come out of the woods

720
00:40:07,054 --> 00:40:08,721
And attack someone in the middle of town?

721
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:10,223
I don't know.

722
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,091
I don't know.

723
00:40:14,094 --> 00:40:16,996
I was so sure that you cut your hand.

724
00:40:17,064 --> 00:40:18,164
I saw it.

725
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:20,766
I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine, ok?

726
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:21,834
We're fine.

727
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:23,970
That's what matters.

728
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:43,256
I thought there was hope

729
00:40:43,323 --> 00:40:45,424
that somewhere deep inside,

730
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:48,828
something in Damon was still human,

731
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,697
Normal.

732
00:40:57,437 --> 00:40:59,472
But I was wrong.

733
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,875
There's nothing human left in Damon.

734
00:41:02,943 --> 00:41:06,145
No good, no kindness.

735
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,547
No love.

736
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:10,383
Only a monster

737
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,286
Who must be stopped.

738

1
00:00:01,934 --> 00:00:03,767
For over a century I have
lived in secret,

2
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:06,934
Until now.
I know the risks,
but I have to know her.

3
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:08,400
I'm Elena.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,934
I'm Stefan.
I'm Damon.

5
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:11,467
You didn't tell me
that you had a brother.

6
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:12,767
It's complicated.

7
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,234
Elena is a dead
ringer for Katherine.

8
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:15,701
Which one of you
dated her first?

9
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:18,067
Katherine is dead,
and you hate me

10
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,434
Because you loved her.

11
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:20,434
I was hoping
I'd see you again.

12
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:22,000
She's not a puppet.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,667
She doesn't exist
for your amusement;

14
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,367
For you to feed on
whenever you want to.

15
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:26,901
They're whatever
I want them to be.

16
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,868
Wear it for me,
for...good luck.

17
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:33,267
You want to kiss me.

18
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,834
Vervain in the necklace.

19
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,200
It's been a while
since anyone could
resist my...compulsion.

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,734
There's nothing
human in Damon.

21
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:42,434
No good,
no kindness, no love.

22
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:45,868
Only a monster
who must be stopped.

23
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:01,901
Hello?

24
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:09,033
Jeremy?

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,267
Hello?

26
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:29,501
Man on tv:
this is logan fell
coming to you live

27
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:31,200
From the streets
of Mystic Falls

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,133
With breaking news
of another deadly
animal attack.

29
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:37,534
The wild animal terrorizing
the citizens of Mystic Falls

30
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:39,667
Has claimed another victim,

31
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:42,100
Local high school student
Elena gilbert.

32
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,667
Police are certain
that forensic eviden
will confirm

33
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:48,167
That this is the same animal
responsible for recent attacks.

34
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:51,033
You know
it's coming next.

35
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,334
Jeremy!

36
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:17,334
Ah!

37
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:18,667
Bad dream?

38
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,167
Ah.

39
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,901
Do you know how easy it was
to get into your head just now?

40
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,801
You really need
some human blood.

41
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,701
It might even
the playing field.

42
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,968
Football reference.

43
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:30,868
Too soon.

44
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:43,334
All right,
I deserved that.

45
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:45,434
But I just wanted
to let you know,

46
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,000
They caught the culprit.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,467
The animal responsible
for killing coach tanner
and all those people.

48
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,267
What are you
talking about?

49
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:53,734
It was a mountain lion.
Really big one.

50
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:56,367
It attacked
a hunter this morning.
It's all over the news.

51
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:57,701
"Deadly beast captured.

52
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:00,100
All's well
in Mystic Falls."

53
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,534
Why would you
cover your tracks?

54
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:06,534
I've decided
to stay a while.

55
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:09,234
I'm just having
way too much fun here
with you and Elena.

56
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:10,601
Can't touch her now.

57
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,167
Well, the vervain
keeps me

58
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,367
Out of her head.

59
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,968
Maybe that's not
my target.

60
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:19,400
Believe it or not,
Stefan, some girls
don't need my persuasion.

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,267
Some girls just can't
resist my good looks,

62
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:25,300
My style and my charm

63
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,834
And my unflinching ability

64
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,334
To listen
to taylor swift.

65
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,834
This is john varvatos, dude.

66
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,267
Dick move.

67
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,634
I can confirm
that a 12-Foot
puma mountain lion

68
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:11,300
Attacked a hunter
and was subsequently
shot and killed.

69
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,767
The hunter is in
stable condition.

70
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:14,701
The real animal
is still out there,

71
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:17,367
Waiting for me,
challenging me
to fight back,

72
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:20,067
To stop him.

73
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:24,133
But how do I stop a monster
without becoming one myself?

74
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,067
To repeat, the animal
terrorizing Mystic Falls
has been caught.

75
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,901
Scum ball.

76
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,100
Scum bucket.

77
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,634
Who are you talking to?

78
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:34,334
Him.

79
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:38,868
The news guy, also known
as logan "scum" fell.

80
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,834
Did your mom ever
tell you why I moved
away from Mystic Falls?

81
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,701
Oh, no way.

82
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,467
You and him?

83
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:46,801
This is logan fell.

84
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:48,334
He's cute.

85
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:49,434
He is not cute.

86
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,968
There's nothing cute
about him.

87
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:55,868
What are you doing
with that?

88
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:58,901
I went yesterday and got it
from the safe deposit box.

89
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,300
Mom had told mrs. Lockwood
she would loan it

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,033
To the founder's council
for their heritage display.

91
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,934
Is that grandma
beth's wedding ring?

92
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:09,601
Originally it was
great-Great-Grandma mary's
wedding ring.

93
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,067
How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

94
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,334
You know, like on ebay?

95
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,601
You're not gonna find out.

96
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:15,167
That stuff is mom
and dad's. You can't
just give it away.

97
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,334
I'm not giving it away.

98
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,567
It's called a loan, jeremy.
[Doorbell rings]

99
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,367
Hi.

100
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,467
Hi.

101
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,200
Are you ok?

102
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,033
I'm good.

103
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,767
Sorry.

104
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,167
Maybe we should
press pause.

105
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,467
Yeah, you're probably right.

106
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,601
That was getting a bit...

107
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,667
Yeah.
Yeah.

108
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:24,000
How do you look
in a suit?

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,501
I can pull one off.
How about tomorrow night?

110
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,701
Will you be my date
to the founder's party?

111
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,000
They still do that?

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,100
Have you been before?

113
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,968
No, the salvatores

114
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:38,367
Don't get
invited anymore.

115
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:41,300
Well, this year,
there's this
heritage project

116
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,901
That meant a lot to my mom.

117
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,934
She was really involved
in the founder's council,

118
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:48,133
And it was
her favorite party.

119
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,267
I know it sounds
really boring, but--

120
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,934
I would be honored
to accompany you,

121
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:53,634
Miss gilbert.

122
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:57,567
The pleasure is all mine,
mr. Salvatore.

123
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,367
No yellow. Jaundice.
Go for the blue.

124
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:06,534
I don't like the blue.

125
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:07,567
Well, I do.

126
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,367
And if I'm gonna
be your date--

127
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:11,133
You cannot be my date.

128
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,334
My mother is going
to be there,

129
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,133
And she is a very proud
gun owner.

130
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,667
I went through
a lot of trouble

131
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,400
To make sure this party
wasn't cancelled.

132
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,434
It's very important
I be there.

133
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,968
Please take me.

134
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:28,634
You should come
to the founder's
party with me.

135
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,300
Not if you're wearing
that dress.

136
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:35,834
At's so special
about this bella girl?

137
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:37,067
Edward's so whipped.

138
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:38,601
You gotta read
the first book first.

139
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:40,934
It won't make sense
if you don't.

140
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:44,334
Ah, I miss anne rice.
She was so on it.

141
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:45,367
How come
you don't sparkle?

142
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,534
Because I live in
the real world,

143
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,434
Where vampires
burn in the sun.

144
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,501
Yeah, but you go
in the sun.

145
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:52,000
I have a ring.
It protects me.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,467
Long story.

147
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:57,734
Will these bites
turn me into a vampire?

148
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:01,434
It's more
complicated than that.

149
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:03,567
You'd have to feed
on my blood, then die,

150
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,067
Then feed on a human's,
whole ordeal.

151
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,968
This book, by thwawa
has it all wrong.

152
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:17,000
You can be very sweet
when you want to be.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,334
Yes, I can be sweet.

154
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:28,367
Are you going to kill me?

155
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,434
Mm-Hmm.

156
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,601
But not yet.

157
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,067
Why not?

158
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,067
Because there's
something I need you
to do for me.

159
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,534
Anything.

160
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,934
How good are you
at getting
this little nose

161
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,267
Where it doesn't
belong?

162
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:42,534
Oh, I'm excellent.

163
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:43,868
Mmm.

164
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,734
So what happens
with the season?

165
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,801
One big forfeit?
Are they looking
for a new coach?

166
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,167
I don't know, dad.

167
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,400
I doubt anybody's
thinking about that right now.

168
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,167
Charles,
founder's party, focus.

169
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,901
How are y'all
doing over here?

170
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,834
Ah, we're doing
great, sweetheart.

171
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:09,234
Is there anything else
I can get you?

172
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:10,534
We're fine, thanks.

173
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:12,467
Just the check, honey.

174
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:15,167
Here you go,
mayor lockwood.
Thanks.

175
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:23,868
You're taking Damon
to the founder's
party? What about me?

176
00:09:23,868 --> 00:09:24,868
Go with Elena.

177
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:25,934
She's asking Stefan.

178
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,801
Ok, go by yourself.

179
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,701
Gee, thanks.
What about your mom?

180
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,968
Is she ok with you
bringing Damon?

181
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:34,100
And I'm supposed to care why?

182
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
He's older
sexy danger guy.

183
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,667
Older sexy danger guy?

184
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,901
Is that an official
witch twitter tweet?

185
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,467
No more
witch jokes, ok?

186
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,801
At whole mr. Tanner
prediction thing
has me freaked.

187
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,334
Ok.

188
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:48,234
And Damon's not dangerous.

189
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:52,267
You know, he just
has a lot of issues
with his brother.

190
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:55,200
You know, like major,
deep-Rooted drama.

191
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,667
Like...?

192
00:09:57,968 --> 00:10:00,234
I'm not really supposed
to say anything.

193
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:03,634
Caroline forbes,
when have you ever kept
a secret in your life?

194
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:04,634
Ok.

195
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:07,567
But you can't tell Elena.

196
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,067
No.

197
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,734
So what you
gonna buy me?

198
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,667
Ugh, some class.

199
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,734
Oh, your parents are gone.
I guess  can bebclose now.

200
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:16,734
What the hell
does that mean?

201
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,400
You treat me like trash.
I'm sick of it.

202
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,701
I don't think
you're trash.

203
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:22,734
Really?
Then who are you taking

204
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:24,601
To the founder's party?

205
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,834
Vicki donovan.

206
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,334
Do you want me
to ask you to
the founder's party?

207
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:30,934
No.

208
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,567
It'll be stupid and lame.

209
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,100
True.

210
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,300
But it'll be less
stupid and lame
if you were there.

211
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:44,868
You realize
you had to ask him
to ask you, right?

212
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:46,801
You figure
if you dress up like

213
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,267
A respectable
young lady,

214
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:49,400
He'll finally
treat you like one?

215
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,501
Screw you, jeremy.

216
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,367
You know you're making
the wrong choice,

217
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,701
Yet you make it anyway.

218
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,033
It's sad.

219
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:12,234
I didn't know
you were here.

220
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:14,067
Just going through
Stefan's homework.

221
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,601
Boy, this country
sure has dumbed down

222
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,334
In the last
hundred years.

223
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:19,234
Why he wants
to go to high school
is beyond me.

224
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,901
I mean, in the seventies,
he went ivy league.

225
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:22,601
Harvard, I understood.

226
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,934
Actually, no. I didn't
get that either.

227
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,334
Go ahead, purge.

228
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,234
Get it out.
What's on your mind?

229
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,300
Why are you here, Damon?

230
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:38,601
To spend time
with you, zach.

231
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:41,167
Family's important.

232
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,968
I know you.

233
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,267
You always have a motive.

234
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,501
So tell me,
what is it this time?

235
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:50,934
You are in no position
to question me.

236
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:53,834
I didn't
mean to upset you.

237
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,934
This is not
upset, zach.

238
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,334
What's going on?

239
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,501
Having a family
moment, Stefan.

240
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,200
Spending some
quality time.

241
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,601
Hey, are you ok?

242
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:10,501
No, I'm not.

243
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:11,767
And neither are you.

244
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:14,334
How many more people
have to die before
you see that?

245
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,367
I see it.
All right, zach, I see it.

246
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:17,467
Then why aren't you
doing anything about it?

247
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:19,000
I can't, zach.

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,968
I can't.

249
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:22,701
It would take human blood.

250
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,033
It's the only way
that I could stop him,
and I can't do that.

251
00:12:27,968 --> 00:12:31,634
The vervain
could weaken him

252
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,634
If he ingested it.

253
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:35,033
It would help get you
the upper hand.

254
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:38,000
Vervain hasn't grown here
since 1865.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,801
Damon saw to that.

256
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,601
The little I had,
I gave to Elena.

257
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:47,934
What?

258
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,133
You've been
growing it.

259
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,400
It's just something
that's been passed down
through the generations.

260
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:19,801
Blood only runs
so deep when you're
related to vampires.

261
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:23,968
Damon would
kill me if he knew
that I had it.

262
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,501
But you're telling me.

263
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,968
Why?

264
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:31,734
Because I trust you.

265
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:33,968
And you're gonna
need it if you want
to get rid of him.

266
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,808
I'm here for my mom.
I was supposed to pick
up a box of stuff.

267
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:52,207
Right here.

268
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,107
Please be careful.

269
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:55,274
Yeah,  careful
with it, dick.

270
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,840
Hey! Not now,
ok, guys? Please?

271
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,873
I'm fine. He's just
being a punk.

272
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:01,174
I got your punk.
Look, Tyler,

273
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,274
Maybe you should go.
Tell your mom that
I'll see her tonight.

274
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,341
Hey.

275
00:14:07,341 --> 00:14:08,374
Would it make
a difference

276
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:10,341
If I told you
I actually like vicki?

277
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:12,808
Not even if you meant it.

278
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:15,374
Delicate flower
vs. Naughty vixen.

279
00:14:15,374 --> 00:14:17,207
Tough call.
Can we mix them?

280
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:19,441
Look at you,
getting all pretty
for your date.

281
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,973
You seem happy-Ish.

282
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,907
I am...ish.

283
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:25,741
Tonight's going
to be a good night.

284
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:26,973
But don't let that
stop you

285
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:28,441
From telling me
whatever it is

286
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:31,007
You wanted to tell
me as soon as you
walked in the door.

287
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:32,040
What if I tell you
in the morning?

288
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,107
I don't want
to ruin the night.

289
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,007
Bonnie, out with it.

290
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:38,507
Ok, but it has to go
in the vault,

291
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:39,708
Because Caroline
will kill me

292
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,840
If it gets back to Damon
that she squealed.

293
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:46,140
Apparently Stefan has
a very interesting back story.

294
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,973
Uh-Huh.

295
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:50,140
Do you know what happened
with his ex-Girlfriend
Katherine?

296
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,674
I know that
they both dated her

297
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:53,107
And that's why
they have issues.

298
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:56,907
Yeah, they both dated her,
only she chose Damon.

299
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:59,107
And that drove Stefan mad,
he did horrible things

300
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,840
To try and break them up.

301
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,741
He manipulated Katherine.

302
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:04,708
He filled her head
with all these lies
until finally

303
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,441
It worked,
and she turned against Damon.

304
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,307
That sounds like
one person's side
of the story,

305
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:10,708
Meaning Damon's.

306
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,840
I just wanted you to know.

307
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,940
Anyway, his past
relationships

308
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,774
Are none of my business.

309
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:17,641
Unless he's a calculating,
manipulative liar.

310
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:19,907
That is your business.

311
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:21,240
Stefan is none
of those things.

312
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,040
Yeah? How do you know?

313
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,040
Do they still wear ties
at this thing?

314
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,207
Why are you
even going?

315
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:36,274
It's only
fitting.

316
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:38,174
We were at the very
first one, remember?

317
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:40,174
I think it's better
if we don't draw
attention to ourselves.

318
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,341
So you should
stay here.

319
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,474
I'll see to it
Elena has a good time.

320
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,774
My goodness,
I've driven you
to drink.

321
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:51,474
Can't seem
to rid myself of you.

322
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:52,708
What else am I
supposed to do,

323
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,374
Besides go about
living my life?

324
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:55,973
Go about living
my life.

325
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:58,074
See, therein lies
your eternal struggle.

326
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,940
You're dead, dude.

327
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,374
Get over it.

328
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:05,007
What do you think?

329
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:14,774
Hello?

330
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,641
Hi, mrs. Lockwood.

331
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:20,140
What do you mean? It is?

332
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,140
Are you sure?

333
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,307
'Cause I saw it.

334
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:27,474
Let me check.

335
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:28,808
Mm-Hmm.

336
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:30,973
I will find it
and bring it.

337
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,674
Ok. Bye.

338
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,873
What's wrong?

339
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,840
Ahh! God, what now?

340
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,541
The pocket watch.
Where is it?

341
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,774
What watch?

342
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:46,040
The one you stole
from mom's box.

343
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,374
Look, mrs. Lockwood
just called me,
freaking out.

344
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:51,040
It was on the list,
jeremy.

345
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,074
And she can't find it,
and she thinks she's
the one who lost it.

346
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:55,007
Maybe she did.
Maybe Tyler took it.

347
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:57,007
Don't even play that card.
Jeremy, you took it.

348
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:58,808
If I go online, am I going
to find it on ebay?

349
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:00,973
Is that how you pay
for your pot?

350
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:02,474
Screw you.

351
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:13,040
I would never sell this, ok?

352
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Then why did you
take it?

353
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,207
Because it's supposed
to be mine.

354
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:17,873
Dad said it goes
to the firstborn son.

355
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:20,307
His father gave it to him,
and now what?

356
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:25,441
And he was going
to give it to you.

357
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:26,741
Yeah.

358
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:34,607
Look, jeremy,
it's still yours, ok?

359
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:37,207
Mom promised mrs. Lockwood.

360
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:38,907
What do you want me to do?

361
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,407
Just take it
and get out.

362
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,641
It's cool
not growing old.

363
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:49,140
I like being
the eternal stud.

364
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,741
Yes, being
a 150-Year-Old teenager

365
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:54,040
Has been the height
of my happiness.

366
00:17:55,973 --> 00:17:58,174
You cracked
a funny, Stefan.

367
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,441
I should have a drink
to celebrate.

368
00:18:09,307 --> 00:18:10,541
1864.

369
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,907
You and Katherine
were the perfect couple.

370
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:15,441
It was hell watching you
dance with her.

371
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:18,140
My happiness was short-Lived,
as you well know.

372
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,240
I remember.

373
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,641
I left the party early,
I was waiting for her.

374
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:24,574
The night you dropped
her off, I was
waiting just inside.

375
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:26,107
You were such
a gentleman,

376
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:28,641
Gave her a kiss
on the cheek.

377
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,973
And what she really
wanted was...

378
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,240
Oh, well.

379
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,074
Here's to history
repeating itself, huh?

380
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:43,207
I admire
your effort, Stefan.

381
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,374
Pouring yourself a drink

382
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,808
Then spiking the bottle
with vervain.

383
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,808
I'm not some drunk
sorority chick.

384
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,840
You can't roofie me.

385
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,040
But I can't help
but feel a little used.

386
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,774
I thought we were
having a moment.

387
00:18:57,574 --> 00:18:59,574
I have to go
to the party angry.

388
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,341
Who knows
what I'll do?

389
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:30,174
Hi, nice to see you.

390
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:43,441
Hi.
How are you?

391
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:45,007
Uh, let's go this way.

392
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:46,140
Why?

393
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,474
Line's too long.

394
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:48,541
We can go around back.

395
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,940
Come on,
party's in the back.

396
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,174
That was his favorite scotch.

397
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:57,641
I'm sorry,
I thought it would work.

398
00:19:57,641 --> 00:19:59,040
I wasn't
counting on it.

399
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,407
You knew it would fail?

400
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,574
Did what I wanted.

401
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:03,840
It lowered
his guard.

402
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,474
You won't expect me
to try again so soon.

403
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,307
I doubled what
I put in the scotch.

404
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,474
Caroline!

405
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:59,474
You look smashing.

406
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:00,973
Thank you,
mrs. Lockwood.

407
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:03,140
This is my boyfriend
Damon.

408
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,441
Oh, well,
come on in.

409
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:06,674
Lovely to meet you.

410
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:08,774
I've been looking forward
to this party for quite a while.

411
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:10,507
Well, enjoy.

412
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:19,607
Wait here.

413
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:22,641
Really, you couldn't
even change out of
the badge for this?

414
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:24,374
I'm working, honey.

415
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:26,441
Who's the date
you just tried
to sneak past me?

416
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:28,407
Just some guy.

417
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:30,040
He's a little
old for you,
don't you think?

418
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,708
Oh, 'cause otherwise
you'd approve.

419
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,374
Yeah, I doubt that.

420
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:35,840
Hi, mayor lockwood.

421
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,674
Hey. Hey, guys,
come on in.

422
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:38,940
Thank you.

423
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,341
Where's your dad?

424
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,274
Memphis.
Good.

425
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:43,973
With stephen.

426
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,207
Your parents?

427
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:27,074
There's a lot of history here.

428
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:44,007
Jenna.

429
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:50,341
It's good to see you.

430
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:52,474
I thought
I might see you here.

431
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:54,307
You knew it.

432
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,574
I dreaded.

433
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,774
But were secretely
hoping.

434
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:58,574
And now that I have...

435
00:22:58,574 --> 00:23:00,107
Whoa, hey, not so fast.

436
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:03,441
I know you. You have
a lot more insults
in you, I can tell.

437
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:05,274
Your hairline's receding.

438
00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:06,708
No, it's not.
You want to have lunch?

439
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,474
Nope.
You haven't
changed a bit.

440
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:09,574
Oh, yes, I have.

441
00:23:09,574 --> 00:23:11,541
I'm meaner now.

442
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:17,240
"The founding families
in Mystic Falls welcomes you

443
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,607
To the inaugural
founder's council
celebration."

444
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,973
Wow, look,
it's the original
guest registry.

445
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:23,574
Look at all these
familiar names--

446
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:25,007
Sheriff william forbes,

447
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:27,873
Mayor benjamin lockwood.

448
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,641
Is that Damon Salvatore?

449
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:34,174
And, look,
Stefan Salvatore.

450
00:23:34,174 --> 00:23:36,774
The original
Salvatore brothers.

451
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:40,474
Our ancestors.
Tragic story, actually.

452
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:44,274
We don't need to
bore them with stories
of the past.

453
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:46,007
It's not boring,
Stefan.

454
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,808
I'd love to hear more
about your family.

455
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:51,808
Well, I'm bored.
I want to dance.

456
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,808
And Damon won't
dance with me.

457
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,240
Mm-Mmm.

458
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,341
Could I just
borrow your date?

459
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:59,940
Oh, uh...

460
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,741
I n't really dance.
Oh, sure he does.

461
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:02,741
You should see him.

462
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,907
Waltz,
the jitterbug,
the moonwalk.

463
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:05,407
He does it all.

464
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,674
You wouldn't mind,
would you, Elena?

465
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:11,973
It's up to Stefan.

466
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:32,574
I want to apologize to you

467
00:24:32,574 --> 00:24:34,174
For being such
a world-Class jerk

468
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,840
The other night
when I tried to kiss you.

469
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,541
There's no excuse.

470
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,607
My therapist says I'm...

471
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:44,907
Acting out,
trying to punish Stefan.

472
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:46,541
[Chuckles] for what?

473
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:48,074
It's all in the past.
I don't even want
to bring it up.

474
00:24:48,074 --> 00:24:50,341
Let's just say that the men
in the Salvatore family

475
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:52,641
Have been cursed
with sibling rivalry.

476
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:57,040
And it all started
with the original
Salvatore brothers.

477
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,641
Damon told you
to ask me to dance.

478
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:01,741
Didn't he?

479
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:04,107
Now why uld he do that?

480
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:09,307
Would you like one?

481
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,973
Thank you.

482
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:15,140
Ok, just tell me
if you see my mom.

483
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,074
The Salvatore name
was practically royalty
in this town.

484
00:25:22,074 --> 00:25:24,907
Until the war.
There was a battle here--

485
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:26,741
The battle
of willow creek.

486
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,007
Right.

487
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:30,407
I know, we talked
about it in class.

488
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:33,407
Confederate soldiers
fired on a church
with civilians inside.

489
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,808
What the history books
left out

490
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:38,441
Was the people
that were killed.

491
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:40,374
They weren't there
by accident.

492
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:42,007
They were believed to be
union sympathizers.

493
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,907
So some of the founders
on the confederacy side
back then

494
00:25:44,907 --> 00:25:47,207
Wanted them rounded up
and burned alive.

495
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,307
Stefan and Damon
had someone they loved

496
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:51,940
Very much
in that church.

497
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:55,607
And when they went
to rescue them,

498
00:25:55,607 --> 00:25:57,074
They were shot.

499
00:25:57,074 --> 00:26:00,240
Murdered
in cold blood.

500
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,808
Who was in the church
that they wanted to save?

501
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,407
A woman, I guess.

502
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:07,607
Doesn't it always
come down

503
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,107
To the love
of a woman?

504
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,107
Look, I'm sorry
that you and Stefan

505
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,708
Have this thing between you,

506
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,774
But I can't get in
the middle of it, Damon.

507
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,074
I just...

508
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:25,240
I hope you two
can work it out.

509
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,274
I hope so, too.

510
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:34,407
So you want to dance?

511
00:26:34,407 --> 00:26:36,040
Me dancing?

512
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,074
Not pretty.

513
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,641
Maybe you could
show me around.

514
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,574
I mean,
this place is amazing.

515
00:26:43,574 --> 00:26:47,074
Yeah, if you like
living in a museum.

516
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,708
Maybe I should just
strip naked

517
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:54,507
And give pastor bill
a lap dance.

518
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:57,507
I mean, that's why
we're hiding in a corner
all night, isn't it?

519
00:26:57,507 --> 00:26:59,140
You're scared of how
I'm going to act?

520
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,507
You afraid of what
your parents are going
to think about your date

521
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:03,007
From the wrong side
of the tracks?

522
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:04,840
I don't care about
what they think.

523
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,007
Great. Let's go say hi.

524
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:08,574
Knock it off, vick.

525
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:10,708
Or we could just,
you know, sneak up
to your bedroom.

526
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:13,374
As long as nobody
sees us, right?

527
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:16,174
Vicki, I swear...
what's a matter, Ty?

528
00:27:16,174 --> 00:27:17,873
You scared to stand up
to your mommy?

529
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:19,873
It's pretty pathetic.

530
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:22,873
Let go!
Tyler...

531
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:25,074
We didn't get a chance
to say hello earlier.

532
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:28,240
It's vicki, right?
Matt's sister.

533
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,541
Yes, ma'am.

534
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,341
You'll have to forgive
my son's rudeness.

535
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:33,774
He gets it
from his father.

536
00:27:33,774 --> 00:27:35,240
Well, that's ok,
mrs. Lockwood.

537
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,574
Tyler and I were just
saying good night.

538
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:46,207
That's what you get
when you bring the trash
into the party.

539
00:28:23,574 --> 00:28:25,207
What'd we miss?

540
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:28,741
We were just chatting.

541
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,441
Drink, Damon?

542
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:33,973
No, thanks,
I'll pass.

543
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:41,174
Stefan, do you have
another dance in you?

544
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:43,940
Absolutely.

545
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,940
They look so cute
together.

546
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,940
Don't talk, please.

547
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:17,907
Don't shoot!

548
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:19,107
I'm going to need
a refill.

549
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:21,140
Shooting implies caring.

550
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,641
Feigned indifference.
I like it.

551
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:25,474
I'm over the banter, logan.

552
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:28,174
I'd really rather
you just left me alone.

553
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:33,641
I'm sorry, Jenna.

554
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:35,808
About your sister.

555
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,641
Thank you.

556
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,240
Came to the funeral.

557
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,940
I know.

558
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,774
I saw you.

559
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:49,407
Yeah, I didn't want
to push my way in,

560
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:51,741
But I wanted to be
there for you.

561
00:29:51,741 --> 00:29:54,474
And when I heard
you were staying
in Mystic Falls,

562
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:56,040
I thought maybe...

563
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,507
Well, maybe I could
have a second chance
to make things right.

564
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:10,541
Her name was Monica,
wasn't it?

565
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:33,007
I hope Damon didn't
drive you too crazy.

566
00:30:34,474 --> 00:30:38,107
No, actually,
he was on good behavior.

567
00:30:38,107 --> 00:30:39,407
He even apologized

568
00:30:39,407 --> 00:30:43,873
and explained why he is
the way he is.

569
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:46,574
And it all goes back
to Katherine.

570
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:48,973
Hmm.

571
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:57,007
So tell me about her.

572
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:58,541
What happened?

573
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:03,407
It's not something
I like to talk about.

574
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:05,808
I get that. I do.

575
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:08,374
I just want you to
know that you can.

576
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:12,240
I mean, I burden you
with all of my drama,

577
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,808
And I want you
to do the same.

578
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:19,040
I know.

579
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,107
Thank you.

580
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:26,074
The truth is, Stefan...

581
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:27,873
I don't really know
that much about you,

582
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:30,808
And I'd really love it
if you would open up to me.

583
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:33,840
Damon said something,
didn't he?

584
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,341
He likes to play games
and cause trouble, Elena.

585
00:31:38,341 --> 00:31:41,808
This isn't about Damon,
it's about me trying
to get to know you.

586
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:45,074
Look, you're the mystery guy,
and I like that.

587
00:31:45,074 --> 00:31:47,374
But with mystery
comes secrets,

588
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:49,741
And this thing with Katherine.

589
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,474
Let it go.
I don't want
to talk about it.

590
00:31:52,474 --> 00:31:55,107
Well, then, say something
about yourself. Anything.

591
00:31:55,107 --> 00:31:59,541
Otherwise, I'm left
with nothing but what
other people tell me.

592
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,774
Don't you see what
Damon has done here?

593
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:05,574
He's trying to get you
to turn against me.

594
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:09,274
Well, then I guess
it's working.

595
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:24,374
This is my fault.
I planted doubt.

596
00:32:24,374 --> 00:32:26,107
I'm a doubt planter.

597
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:27,541
It's not your fault.

598
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,207
I just--
I feel terrible

599
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,907
Because I said that
I wouldn't get in
the middle of it,

600
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:33,541
And that's exactly
what I did.

601
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:36,441
I got all snotty.

602
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:39,140
Elena, honey,
there you are.

603
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,307
I notice the watch
still isn't in
the collection.

604
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:45,840
Oh, um, I'm sorry,
mrs. Lockwood.

605
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,474
I, um, I couldn't find it.

606
00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:52,641
I guess it's still
packed up in my parents'
stuff somewhere.

607
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:54,107
I see.

608
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:56,341
Well, please
let me know
if you do find it.

609
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,207
Ok.

610
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:03,574
Where have you been?

611
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:04,808
Ah.

612
00:33:06,074 --> 00:33:09,174
Looking for you.

613
00:33:09,174 --> 00:33:12,140
Your brother barely
danced with me
for five minutes--

614
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,107
Ok, just a minute.
Stand right...there.

615
00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:26,574
Um, you're not
supposed to touch.

616
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,907
What is that?

617
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,741
It's a very important crystal.

618
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:33,607
Well, how did you know
that it was there?

619
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:34,973
Because I put it there.

620
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,973
When?
A long time ago.

621
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,507
Tonight, I'm taking it back,
thanks to you.

622
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:41,174
Well, what's it for?
Never you mind.

623
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:43,174
You can't just steal it.

624
00:33:43,174 --> 00:33:44,174
It's not stealing
if it's mine.

625
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:45,507
Come on.
Well...

626
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:48,074
Vodka tonic.

627
00:33:56,873 --> 00:33:59,541
Ok, I know that this
is probably going
to be strike 3,

628
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:02,808
But I hope
you can see it
for what it is.

629
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,407
And what is it?
Persistence.

630
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:08,441
Groveling, commitment.
Take your pick.

631
00:34:08,441 --> 00:34:09,674
I fled town
because of you.

632
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:10,741
Fled.

633
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:12,507
I was young and stupid,

634
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:14,474
And then things changed.

635
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:18,174
Life got...real.

636
00:34:18,174 --> 00:34:20,574
You'd know that better
than anyone.

637
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:26,641
Hypothetically speaking,
if allowed,

638
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:28,808
How would you
make things right?

639
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:30,907
Well, more groveling,
of course.

640
00:34:30,907 --> 00:34:34,641
A recap of the past
few years spent
soul searching.

641
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:35,940
Cheese fries.

642
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,407
Obvious.

643
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:41,741
I know my audience.

644
00:34:45,774 --> 00:34:48,474
Yes to lunch. Call me.

645
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:54,840
Look around.
What's missing?

646
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,741
The flames, the candles.

647
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:58,507
Why aren't they lit?

648
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:02,240
There's matches
in the kitchen.

649
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:10,441
Bitch.

650
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:43,940
Hey.

651
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,274
Hey.

652
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,140
So how are things
with Stefan?

653
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,074
Great. Just great.

654
00:35:51,074 --> 00:35:53,174
Really?

655
00:35:53,174 --> 00:35:55,607
Well, my radar
must be off,

656
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:58,940
'Cause I was
getting all sorts
of other vibes,

657
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,674
What is that?

658
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:03,873
Hmm?

659
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:05,973
Don't!

660
00:36:05,973 --> 00:36:07,307
Oh god, Caroline,
what happened?

661
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:08,873
Nothing, ok?!

662
00:36:08,873 --> 00:36:10,873
That is nothing.
Did somebody hurt you?

663
00:36:10,873 --> 00:36:12,441
No, ok, nothing.

664
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:14,474
It just...

665
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,774
My mom would kill me.

666
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,641
Did Damon hurt you?

667
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:22,474
No! Of course not!

668
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,040
Just leave me alone,
ok, Elena?!

669
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,907
God!

670
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:39,374
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

671
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:42,341
You stay away
from Caroline or I will
go straight to her mother,

672
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:44,374
The sheriff. You got it?

673
00:36:44,374 --> 00:36:46,740
Stay away from her.

674
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:56,774
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:58,574
I take it all back.

676
00:36:58,574 --> 00:37:00,273
You're completely
right about Damon.

677
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:01,273
What did he do?

678
00:37:01,273 --> 00:37:02,340
There are bruises

679
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,807
All over
Caroline's body.

680
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,108
Bite marks,
and he has her
all confused

681
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:07,941
And messed up
in the head.

682
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:13,407
You don't look
surprised.

683
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:16,041
Um...

684
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,540
I'm handling it.

685
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,774
Handling it?

686
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:21,974
Stefan, you should be
having him arrested.

687
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:23,173
Elena, please.

688
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:24,507
I...

689
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:26,173
I don't expect you
to understand.

690
00:37:26,173 --> 00:37:28,941
I don't understand
anything, Stefan.

691
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:31,340
So why don't you just
clear it up for me?

692
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,340
Look, there are things
that you don't know, ok?

693
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,474
Things that I want
to tell you, but I can't.

694
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:39,307
And I may never
be able to.

695
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:43,240
And I just need you
to trust me.

696
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
Trust is earned.

697
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,440
I can't justagically
hand it over.

698
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,273
I'm so sorry.
I have to go.

699
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:18,074
You look amazing.
What are you doing here?

700
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:22,041
I was thinking maybe
I could make one more
wrong choice today.

701
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,907
I still have 17 minutes.

702
00:38:38,574 --> 00:38:40,507
Don't!

703
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:44,474
She took it off and I
got flustered, ok?!

704
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:45,641
I didn't know
what to say.

705
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:46,907
But I swear, ok, I did
not tell her.

706
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,874
I just told her that you
didn't mean to hurt me.

707
00:39:08,907 --> 00:39:12,407
You make me crazy,
you know that?

708
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:17,874
It's ok.
I forgive you.

709
00:39:17,874 --> 00:39:19,941
I swear I didn't say--

710
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,440
Shh, shh, shh.

711
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:30,874
Unfortunately...

712
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:35,540
I am so over you now.

713
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,273
What the hell?

714
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,108
You know, I couldn't
spike your drink...

715
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:04,774
So I spiked hers.

716
00:40:36,774 --> 00:40:39,008
Caroline?

717
00:40:39,008 --> 00:40:41,074
There you are.

718
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:44,641
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

719
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:47,474
Are you ok?

720
00:40:47,474 --> 00:40:50,474
Yeah. I'm fine.

721
00:40:50,474 --> 00:40:52,507
Caroline,
what happened?

722
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:54,240
I'm fine.

723
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,941
No.

724
00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:58,774
You're shaking.
Caroline--What--
I'm fine!

725
00:40:58,774 --> 00:41:00,173
Caroline, come here,
come here.

726
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:04,507
I did
what I had to do...

727
00:41:05,274 --> 00:41:08,141
To protect Elena,
to protect everyone.

728
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:13,174
Yes, Damon,
the headline reads

729
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:15,007
"Deadly beast captured.

730
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:18,007
All is well
in Mystic Falls."

731
00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:24,007
Thank you
for staying so late.

732
00:41:24,007 --> 00:41:25,841
Did you get
the gilbert watch?

733
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:29,274
She claims it's packed away
in her parents' things.

734
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:33,240
I can get it.

735
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,140
Good. We're going
to need it.

736
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,107
Are you sure?

737
00:41:37,107 --> 00:41:39,140
5 bodies
all drained of blood?

738
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,040
I'm certain.

739
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,741
They've come back.

00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:05,367
<i>previously on vampire diaries
for over a century, i have lived in secret until now..</i>

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:07,300
I know the risk,
but i have to know her.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,634
Caroline: how come
you don't sparkle?

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:09,901
Because i live
in the real world,

5
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,834
Vampes bin sun.
you go in the sun.

6
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:13,835
I have a ring.
it protects me.

7
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:15,336
The pocket watch. where is it?

8
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:16,337
It's supposed to be mine.

9
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:17,338
Did you get the gilbert watch?

10
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:18,339
I can get it.

11
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,340
Good. we're gonna need it.

12
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:20,868
Caroline:
what is that?

13
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:22,869
A very important crystal.

14
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:25,100
You're the mystery guy
and i like that.

15
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,434
But with mystery
comes secrets.

16
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:28,434
I just need you
to trust me.

17
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:29,634
Trust is earned.

18
00:00:31,635 --> 00:00:32,635
Oh, my god, caroline,
what happened?

19
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:33,801
Nothing
did damon hurt you?!

20
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,167
There are bruises all over caroline.

21
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,300
I'm handling it.

22
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,000
Zach: the vervain
could weaken him

23
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,200
If he ingested it.
it would help get you
the upper hand.

24
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,634
I knew i couldn't
spike your drink,

25
00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:46,267
So i spiked hers.

26
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:49,801
Five bodies
all drained of blood?

27
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,467
They've come back.

28
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:08,567
Damon:
where is my ring?

29
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:11,167
Won't be
needing it anymore.

30
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,901
[groans]

31
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,967
How long
have i been here?

32
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:17,867
Three days.

33
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:21,267
What are you doin'?

34
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:24,167
During the dark ages
when a vampire's actions

35
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,868
Threatened to expose
or bring harm upon
the entire race,

36
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:29,534
They would face
judgment.

37
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:31,567
They sought to reeducate them

38
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,968
Rather than
to punish them.

39
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,067
You know what
will happen if i don't...

40
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,234
Feed on blood.

41
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:40,235
You'll grow weaker and weaker.

42
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,534
Eventually
you won't be able
to move or speak.

43
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,234
In a week your skin
will desiccate,

44
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:45,734
And you'll mummify.

45
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:47,235
A living corpse.

46
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,534
Unable to hurt anyone.

47
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:52,000
Ever.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,567
So what, you're just going
to leave me in the basement,

49
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,100
Forever?

50
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,067
I've injected you
with enough vervain
to keep you weak.

51
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,734
Once your circulation stops,

52
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,901
I'll move you
to the family crypt,
and then in 50 years,

53
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:04,100
We can reevaluate.

54
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,000
[strained chuckle]
i'm stronger than you think.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,868
You always have been.

56
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,100
But you're not sntronger
than the vervain.

57
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,400
And we both know it.

58
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,434
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:22,767
Didn't have
to be this way.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,167
I--i'm sorry,
i'm almost done.

61
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,667
It's--it's ok.
take your time.

62
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,167
[music playing]

63
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,968
I think you might be
in trouble.

64
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,834
What did you do?

65
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,835
Oh, she saw me.

66
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:34,234
I'm a drug-using delinquent.

67
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:36,000
A girl in bed
doesn't really rank.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,133
Sorry.

69
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,934
Elena: jenna!

70
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:46,133
Are you aware of what's
going on upstairs?

71
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,734
Uh-huh.

72
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:49,400
And you have no objection?

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,334
He could be
craftier about it,

74
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,501
At least make an effort
to sneak her in and out.

75
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,502
Oh, and just so you know,

76
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,767
I won't be home
for dinner.

77
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,767
Oh, so you're actually
going to do it.

78
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:02,300
You're gonna go out with logan.

79
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,501
I'm going to show up
and torture him, yes.

80
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:05,767
[chuckles]

81
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,133
And have you heard
from stefan?

82
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:12,300
Not sinceft that
very vague message
three days ago.

83
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,267
"hi, um, elena,

84
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:17,167
"i, um, have something
i have to do.

85
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,334
I'll, uh, explain
in a few days."

86
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:22,868
Haven't you called him?
nope.

87
00:04:22,868 --> 00:04:24,734
Not going to, either.

88
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:27,167
And you're ok
with eeverything?

89
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:30,234
No, i'm not ok
with any of it.

90
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:32,367
But i'm not gonna
cry about it, either.

91
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,200
You , i was going
to write in my diary
this morning

92
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,234
And then i thought,
what am i going to write?

93
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,267
Honestly, i'm not
gonna be onee of those pathetic girls

94
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:41,634
Whose world stops spinning
because of some guy.

95
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:43,334
Ok, then.

96
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:46,434
I'll be fine.

97
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:48,234
He's awake.

98
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:49,601
He's weak,
but it's probably best

99
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,767
To stay out of the basement.

100
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,868
He's damon. i'm not sure
how dangerous

101
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:54,467
He still might be.
you're going to school?

102
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,701
Came here to live a life.

103
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:57,968
It's about time
i get back to that.

104
00:04:57,968 --> 00:05:00,467
And elena,
if she's still
speaking to me.

105
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,767
Why haven't you
called her?

106
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,934
Am suppose to do,
feed her another lie?

107
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,267
I hate lying to her, zach.
i'm not good at it.

108
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:07,934
She already thinks
i'm hiding something.

109
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:08,901
What choice
do you have?

110
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,901
You came here because you wanted to live
as normal a life as you could.

111
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,033
You knew this was going
to be a part of it.

112
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,601
Caroline:
i remember the party.

113
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,067
Damon came up
behind me,

114
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:24,901
And he was kissing
my neck,

115
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:27,534
Or biting my neck.

116
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:29,033
I passed out.

117
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,033
It's like there's holes in my memory lately.

118
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,234
It's just weird.

119
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,901
Maybe i let him bite me.

120
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,234
Why would you do that?

121
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:43,167
Can we just not
talk about it, ok?

122
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,534
Donn't want
to talk about damon.

123
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:46,501
I don't want
to talk about

124
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:47,934
Any of it.

125
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:51,100
Just want to go
back to normal.

126
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,467
What are you doing
with that candle?

127
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,701
Um...

128
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:59,133
Nothing.

129
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,400
What's this?

130
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,901
Damon gave it to me.

131
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:05,102
Or he was going to give it to me.

132
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:07,300
All i know is,

133
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,901
It's mine now.

134
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,567
It's ugly.

135
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,167
Well, get your hands off it.

136
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,567
Roline: the sexy suds
car wash is tomorrow.

137
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,667
The football team
and the band have committed.

138
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,668
Well, not all the band.

139
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,669
Just the ones who could pull off the bikini.

140
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,170
I want, in your face, sexy.

141
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,671
I mean, it's a fund raiser, for god's sake.

142
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,501
Unbelievable.

143
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,400
It's like nothing
happened.

144
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,467
Lies and denial.

145
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:47,167
Hey.

146
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:50,168
Hey. you know, i gotta go.

147
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,169
Be somewhere right now.

148
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:57,400
I'm so sorry
i haven't called.

149
00:06:58,401 --> 00:06:59,401
No worries.

150
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:01,033
I'll live.

151
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:03,534
I was dealing with damon.

152
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,868
And did you...
deal with damon?

153
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:07,869
Yes. yeah.

154
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,870
For four days?

155
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:11,571
You have every right to be upset with me.

156
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:14,572
But can i explain it all to you?
please.

157
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,534
Sure. when?

158
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:19,535
I gotta be home after school, but

159
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:21,536
The grill, on four o'clock?

160
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,901
Ok.
thanks.

161
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:27,902
Stefan, where is damon?

162
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:30,367
He has some serious apologizing to do.

163
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:31,368
He's gone, caroline.

164
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,167
When is he coming back?

165
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,033
He's not coming back.

166
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,034
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,367
This is a good
thing, caroline.

168
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:56,367
I know that.

169
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:01,234
[indistinct chatter]

170
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,501
Hey, matt, um,

171
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:07,234
Have you seen stefan?

172
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:09,200
Nope
[sighs]

173
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
If you want
to kill some time,

174
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,734
Um, you can rack.

175
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,868
[chuckles]
come on.

176
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:16,833
We haven't played
in forever.

177
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:19,534
I'll let you brick.

178
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,234
[damon coughing]

179
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,567
I'm full of vervain.

180
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,601
I've been putting it
in my coffee for 16 years.

181
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,801
My blood will only
make you worse.

182
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:56,802
Damon?

183
00:08:57,201 --> 00:09:01,067
So it was your vervain.
good for you.

184
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,401
Good for you.

185
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:07,434
Family only runs so deep.

186
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:09,067
[coughing]

187
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:10,733
We're not family,
damon.

188
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:13,100
Only in the most
dysfunctional sense.

189
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,668
In fact, i avoided having
a living, breathing,

190
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:16,934
Loving family
because of you.

191
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't guess
i could talk you into

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,100
Bringing me a rabbit
or something?

193
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,334
I'd settle
for stefan's diet
at this point.

194
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,767
You know
i can't do that.

195
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:30,401
You succeeded, zach.

196
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,700
I'm shutting down.

197
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,000
[breathing heavily]

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,900
You're like
your grandfather.

199
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,100
He didn't like it when
i came to visit, either.

200
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,134
But you don't
visit, damon.

201
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:44,134
You appear, unannounced,

202
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:46,234
Reminding me that
this isn't my house;

203
00:09:46,234 --> 00:09:48,900
That you're just
permitting me to live here.

204
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,434
Hell, that you're
permitting me to live.

205
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:54,334
Someone had
to mow the lawn.

206
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,967
[scoffs]

207
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,467
I came to say
good-bye, damon.

208
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,034
Unlock it.

209
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:06,767
Unlock the door, zach.

210
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,367
[groaning]

211
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:17,267
[grunting]

212
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,000
[damon coughing]

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,767
Keep it up, damon.

214
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:25,067
The more energy
you expend,

215
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,100
The faster you'll go.

216
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,167
And there's vicki,
all nonchalant
in the bathroom

217
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,767
Like it's no big deal
that they're hooking up.

218
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,167
Yeah, i'm not gonna lie.

219
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,201
Your brother
and my sister,
that's weird.

220
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,668
Yeah.

221
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,800
How late is he?

222
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:43,167
Hitting
the hour mark.

223
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:45,501
Hope there's
nothing wrong.

224
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:48,867
Which means i'm not
talking boy problems
with you.

225
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,467
Good.

226
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,334
I mean, it's not
like we were ever

227
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:53,900
Best friends
or anything.

228
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,467
[scoffs]

229
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,267
Ok.

230
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,100
Here goes--

231
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
What do you
think of stefan?

232
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,367
Is he a good guy?

233
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,867
Why? what's he done?

234
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,634
Not any one thing.

235
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,201
He's just so secretive
all the time.

236
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,000
I think there's something
that he doesn't want me to know,

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,367
Which makes me
want to know
all the more.

238
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,167
Like what? like that
he's a serial killer

239
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,167
And he keeps
a clown suit
in his trunk?

240
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:18,733
[chuckles] no,
of course not.

241
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:21,501
But what do we know
about him, really?

242
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:23,534
He's great
at football.

243
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:25,800
A little bit
of a loner.

244
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,301
And as much as
i hate saying it,

245
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,700
He might be
a nice guy.

246
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:36,501
So you think
i'm just being paranoid?

247
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,334
I think you should
talk to him.

248
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:40,000
Stefan: talk to who?

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,134
I'm so sorry
that i'm late.

250
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:44,167
What happened?

251
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,367
I got held up.

252
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,568
Is everything ok?

253
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:50,700
There was this thing
with my uncle.

254
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,434
And you couldn't call
and tell me that you were
going to be an hour late?

255
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:55,334
Ok. you two
have fun.

256
00:11:56,568 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm really sorry.

257
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,100
It was unavoidable.

258
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,401
What was unavoidable?

259
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:05,201
[chuckles] ok.

260
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,501
Oh, uh, elena,
please...

261
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:08,267
No, stefan,
don't you get it?

262
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:12,067
Every question
gets a vague non-answer.

263
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:14,501
What is so awful
that you're afraid
to tell me?

264
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,501
Man: i know you.

265
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,134
My god.

266
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:23,434
I'm sorry?
i know you.

267
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:25,467
How can it be?

268
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28,367
I think you have
the wrong person, sir.

269
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,434
You haven't aged a day.

270
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:35,867
I'm sorry. excuse me.

271
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:38,067
Hey, can we--
can i take you home

272
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,700
And we can talk
about it?

273
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,034
Is that ok?

274
00:12:42,034 --> 00:12:44,800
Wait, what was that?

275
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,434
I--i don't know.
uh, nothing.

276
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,800
Right, nothing.
ok, um...

277
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,601
I gotta go, stefan.

278
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:54,833
Excuse me.

279
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,967
Elena: i tried.

280
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,768
I want so much
to make things right,

281
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:11,534
But every instinct
in my body

282
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:13,933
Is telling me
to be careful.

283
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:17,267
What you don't know
can hurt you.

284
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,401
Evening, sheriff.

285
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,668
Anything?

286
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,833
We went over the entire
west side of the lake.

287
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,668
All the caverns
by the falls were clean,

288
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:28,134
No signs of habitat.

289
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:29,800
Well, they're
staying in town.

290
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,501
We canvassed all
abandoned buildings
and warehouses.

291
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,034
There has to be
a private residence.

292
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:36,367
And that much harder
to locate, if not impossible.

293
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,867
These creatures are smart.
they know how to go undetected.

294
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:40,100
Well, someone who only
comes out at night

295
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,534
Should eventually
become obvious.

296
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,501
What about the watch?
i'm working on it.

297
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:45,034
I knew the gilberts.

298
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:46,334
That watch is passed down

299
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:48,833
To the men in the family.
i'd start with jeremy.

300
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,634
I can't believe
you really came.

301
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,634
You have an hour.

302
00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:59,334
Make it count.

303
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:00,967
Jeremy: you ok?

304
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:03,167
Is vicki in there?

305
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,833
Don't answer a question
with another question.

306
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,434
Maybe.

307
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:09,900
What's wrong with you?

308
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:12,800
I'm miserable.

309
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,601
Well, you should go
gesomething to eat.

310
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:21,933
[water running]

311
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:24,267
Jenna?

312
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:29,401
[water stops]
jenna?

313
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:32,467
Stefan?

314
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,800
What are you
doing here?

315
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,234
Dinner.

316
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:38,900
Jeremy told me
that chicken parmesan
is one of your favorites,

317
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,734
And i happen to be
a good cook.

318
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:42,501
The italian roots
demand it.

319
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:44,534
I can even make
my own homemade mozzarella.

320
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:48,601
Only tonight,
it is unfortunately
storboboht.

321
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,000
Sorry.

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,334
I don't know
what you're trying
to accomplish.

323
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:55,668
You want to know me, right?

324
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,501
Well, i figure
if you're going
to dump me,

325
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:02,401
You should at least,
um, know who you're dumping.

326
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,734
So let's start
with katherine.

327
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:07,034
Stefan...

328
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:11,100
She was...the most
beautiful girl that
i had ever met.

329
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,034
She had this perfect
olive skin.

330
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:16,900
And she had this laugh.

331
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,567
It was ridiculous.

332
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,734
I mean, her laugh
made you laugh.

333
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:23,100
And she was fun.

334
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,601
She knew how to have
a good time.

335
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:29,367
But katherine was also
very impatient and entitled

336
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,967
And selfish, and, um,
and impulsive.

337
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,134
Enter damon.

338
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,567
He claims that he was
with her first.

339
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:37,634
I don't know.

340
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,167
I do know
that i did some things

341
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:42,601
That...i'm not proud of.

342
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:47,668
And my biggest regret...

343
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:50,734
Is not being able
to make it right
before she died.

344
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,933
I miss her, but...

345
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:59,434
I'm no longer crippled
by her loss.

346
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:04,334
Vicki: it was very nice
what you did for stefan.

347
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:05,668
Very romantic.

348
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:07,601
Well, i was feeling romantic.

349
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,367
Look what i found.

350
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:12,200
"elena gilbert,

351
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,467
"take one tablet
every 4 to 6 hours,

352
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:15,701
As needed for pain."

353
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,967
Those are left over
from the car accident.

354
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:19,367
So she won't
miss them.

355
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,100
Nonot with that,
that's an antique.

356
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,067
[sighs]

357
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:32,501
I feel like
we're always
getting high.

358
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:34,434
That's the beauty
of choice.

359
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,867
Well, then let's
choose not to.

360
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:40,034
I mean, we don't have to be
high all the time, right?

361
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,900
I really hope you're
not one of those guys

362
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,301
Who, now that
we're together,

363
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,200
Tries to change
everything about me.

364
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,401
No.

365
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:50,900
Good.

366
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,900
[music playing]

367
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,833
I'm an avid reader,
a huge fitzgerald fan,

368
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,601
<i>the great gatsby,
his masterpiece.</i>

369
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:04,467
But i'm no snob.
i love some good grisham.

370
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,833
<i>i think seinfeld 
is the best american
television show</i>

371
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,401
For the past 50 years,

372
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:11,067
<i>but i love lucy
is all-time.</i>

373
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:12,967
"the loving cup" episode
was the best, i think.

374
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:15,334
Huge scorsese fan.

375
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:19,167
<i>i can watch taxi driver 
over and over again.</i>

376
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,234
Here, let me.

377
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:23,833
As far as music,
it's pretty much
across the board.

378
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,167
Um, dylan, hendrix,
patsy, willie.

379
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:30,334
Oh, kanye. you know
what, i even like
that one miley song.

380
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:31,701
[scoffs]
easy.

381
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:33,200
I didn't say anything.

382
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,034
Hey, this is for
the garlic bread, right?

383
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:37,800
Because i'm not eating garlic
unless you agree to, too.

384
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,668
Are you kidding?
i love garlic.

385
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,200

Stefan salvatore.

521
00:24:57,467 --> 00:25:00,034
Nah, it can't be.
it's just my mind

Playing tricks on me.

523
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,301
Where do you think
you'd seen him before?

524
00:25:04,301 --> 00:25:05,734
When i first moved here,

525
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:08,367
I stayed
at the salvatore
boarding house.

Passing through
to visit his uncle.

529
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:14,134
I mean, none of us
knew he was even here

530
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:15,768
Until the attack.

531
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:16,867

Oh, how could you?

539
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,501

this happened
years ago.

He wasn't bugging
you, was he?

00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,967
He's a little
alzy-heimer.

545
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:47,800
No, he was sweet.

546
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,734
Hey, sir,

00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:52,800
I'm sorry. um,

That you knew, his name
was stefan salvatore?

Yes.

551
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:04,234

Caroline finally
freed you, huh?

560
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,957
Uh, i don't know
where she went.

561
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:47,390
She abandoned me.

562
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,457
Hey, i realized earlier,
i had no idea

563
00:26:49,457 --> 00:26:51,390
That your family
was from italy.

564
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,557
No?

565
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:55,757
Last name salvatore
didn't do it for you?

566
00:26:55,757 --> 00:26:57,124
Right.

567
00:26:57,124 --> 00:26:58,790
Duh.

Hmm.

573
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:12,024
Why?

574
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:15,757

579
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:24,857

Your car was done

You're saying that

589
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:57,224
Hi. elena, right?
i think i met you once

590
00:27:57,224 --> 00:27:58,790
When you were 9.
oh.

591
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,557
Your emotional
maturity level when
we were together.

592
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,423
Ouch. here i thought
we were making progress.

593
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:05,924
Is he enough
in your good graces

594
00:28:05,924 --> 00:28:07,490
That i can ask him
for a favor?

595
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,157
If i do her a favor,
will i get back in
your good graces?

596

Uh, a very reluctant
maybe to both.

Done. wait.

Dinner, tonight,

599
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,091
Fine. but you're
eating leftovers.

600
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:22,390
Ooh.

[chuckles]
what do you need?

602
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:25,757
Do you have access
to old news stories,

603
00:28:25,757 --> 00:28:27,423
Say, fifties?

604
00:28:27,423 --> 00:28:28,924
Yeah, at the station.

605
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:30,091
Between the ariveses
and the internet,

606
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:31,224
We pretty much
have everything.

607
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:33,258
I have this report
way past due.

608
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:34,891
It'd be a life saver.

609
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:35,924
Heading there now.

610
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:38,624
Let's go.

611
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:40,324
If anyone asks,
you don't know where i went.

612
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:43,457
I don't want caroline
to know that i left.

help me.

615
00:28:58,423 --> 00:29:00,624
Help me.

616
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,057
Damon?

617
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:48,891
Damon?

618
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,490
Damon?

619
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:59,590
Oh, my god!

620
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,358
What is this?

621
00:30:01,358 --> 00:30:04,057
How did i know
that you were here?

622
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:06,724
Because i wanted you to.

623
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:10,258
Very, very badly.

624
00:30:13,024 --> 00:30:14,657
Let me out of here.

625
00:30:14,657 --> 00:30:16,690
Please.

626
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,590
You bit me.

627
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,891
You liked it.

628
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:22,523
Remember?

629
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,291
Why do i keep remembering
the same things,

630
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:30,358
But in different ways?

631
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:33,490
You remember what
i want you to remember.

632
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,991
And now that
the vervain has passed
out of your system,

633
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:40,423
You won't remember
what you're about to do.

634
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,523
What am i
about to do?

635
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:48,024
You're gonna
open the door.

636

You're gonna
open the door.

Zach: no! no!

638
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:03,557
Get out of here.

What?

645
00:31:50,757 --> 00:31:52,423
We have to clean
the pavement.

646
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:53,490
It's a car wash.

647
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,024
By definition,
the pavement's clean.

648
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:56,358
But not dry.

649
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:57,624
And i'm doing this why?

650
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,624
Caroline bailed,
so that leaves me in charge.

651
00:31:59,624 --> 00:32:02,457

What just happened?

660
00:32:47,457 --> 00:32:50,957
You were in some
kind of a trance.

661

Did i do this?

662
00:32:55,124 --> 00:32:57,923
I think so, yes.

did they?

you're looking for?

You believe there's
actual news to cover
in this town?

678

All right, use keywords
to search the database.

It's pretty easy
to navigate.

117
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,234
You said you would
explain everything.

118
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:06,434
That's why i asked you
to meet me here.

119
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,934
When you google "vampire,"
you get a world of fiction.

120
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:10,067
What's the reality?

121
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:11,400
I can tell you
whatever you wanna know.

122
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,567
I know you eat garlic.
yes.

123
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,400
And somehow,
sunlight's not an issue.

124
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:18,200
Here's your drinks.

125
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,067
Thank you.

126
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,334
We have rings
that protect us.

127
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:24,133
Crucifixes?
decorative.

128
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,100
Holy water?
drinkable.

129
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,601
Mirrors?
myth.

130
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,501
You said you don't kill
to survive.

131
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:30,834
Animal blood
keeps me alive,

132
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,000
But not as strong
as damon. it can be
very powerful.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And yet you let him
get involved with caroline?

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,567
Forcing damon
not to do something

135
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,167
Is much more dangerous,
believe me.

136
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,734
He was hurting her.

137
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:41,634
He was feeding on her.
he was able

138
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,968
To take away
her memories
of being bitten

139
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,100
using a form
of mind compulsion.

140
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,634
She never knew what
was happening to her.

141
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:48,400
If he wanted
to kill her,
he would have.

142
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,901
Is that supposed
to make it ok?

143
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:52,100
no. no, none of this
is ok, elena.

144
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,667
I know that.

145
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,667
Are there any others,
aside from you and damon?

146
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,133
Not in mystic falls,
not anymore.

147
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:06,300
Not anymore?

148
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:11,100
There was a time
when this town was...

149
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,167
Very much aware
of vampires,

150
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,234
And it didn't end well
for anybody.

151
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:17,601
That's why it's
important that you
don'tell anyone.

152
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,267
I can't promise that.

153
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,300
Elena...

154
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,934
Give me today.

155
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:30,601
I will answer any
questions that you have,

156
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:31,934
And when it's over,

157
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,601
You can decide
for yourself

158
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:36,300
What you wanna do
with what you know.

159
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,634
It'll be your choice.

160
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:47,634
Never smelled one
this bad before.

161
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,434
It tried to cover
its tracks.

162
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:51,434
Are you sure?

163
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:53,200
I'm positive.
you only burn a corpse

164
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,934
To try to hide
cause of death,

165
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:56,400
And there are
no shell casings.

166
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,868
We know who they are?

167
00:10:57,868 --> 00:10:59,901
Doc'll have to check
their dental records.

168
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:02,367
What story should i run?

169
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:05,467
Drug deal gone bad.

170
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,534
It's not too big a stretch.

171
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,567
I got the gilbert watch.

172
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,033
Good.

173
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,200
Found this in the brush
about 10 yards away.

174
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,100
Vicki donovan.

175
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,901
You know her?

176
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:27,901
I went to high school
with her mother.

177
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:32,000
Think she's
one of these?

178
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,467
I hope not.

179
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,167
Where are you, stefan?

180
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,834
I'm trapped at the house,

181
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,434
And i'm getting really bored
and really impatient,

182
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:46,734
and i don't do bored
and impatient.

183
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:48,901
Bring me my ring.

184
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:51,267
[music playing]

185
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,100
Damn it.

186
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,067
Aw, don't get blood
on the couch.

187
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:57,267
Please.

188
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:13,067
I got you good,
didn't i?

189
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,901
Well, you're not
gonna be any fun today.

190
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,868
I'm so gonna
regret this.

191
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,234
[gasping]

192
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:35,601
Drink up.

193
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:38,133
Drink it up.

194
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:40,968
Don't drip.

195
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,667
There you go. good girl.

196
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,400
That's it.

197
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,267
Stefan: stop here.

198
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:03,968
What are we doing here?

199
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,801
I want to show you something.

200
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:09,234
In the middle
of nowhere?

201
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:12,734
This...

202
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:14,501
Didn't used to be nowhere.

203
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,167
Used to be my home.

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,734
It looks so...

205
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,968
Old?

206
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:41,267
It's because
they are.

207
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:45,534
Wait. how long have you...

208
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:53,267
I've been 17 years old
since 1864.

209
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,901
Oh, my god.

210
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,167
You said
you wanted to know.

211
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,801
I'm not gonna
hold anything back.

212
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:15,033
Half century before
the boardinghouse
was even built,

213
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,133
This was
my family's home.

214
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,567
Damon and i...

215
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,767
We were both born here.

216
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:26,634
The salvatore brothers,
best of friends.

217
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:27,634
Raah!

218
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,934
Wait. where did you
learn this game?

219
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:31,100
Camp outside atlanta.

220
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,868
One of t officers
picked it up at harvard. catch.

221
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Wait a minute.
wait a minute.

222
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,267
What are the rules?
what are the rules?

223
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:40,767
Who needs rules?

224
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,701
Mind if i join you?

225
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:49,534
Uh, well,
you could, uh--
you could get hurt.

226
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:52,234
My brother likes
to play rough.

227
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:54,868
Somehow, i think
that you play rougher.

228
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:59,334
[laughing]

229
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,234
Why are you
just standing there?

230
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,267
That is a girl
who clearly wants
to be chased.

231
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:07,100
If you don't do it,
i will.

232
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:19,934
You knew katherine
1864?

233
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,601
Damon made it
seem like--

234
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:24,667
Damon was trying
to make you think that...

235
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,567
I was still heartbroken.

236
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:29,000
He saw that i was happy
with you,

237
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And he wanted to ruin it.

238
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,267
All because you
loved the same girl
145 years ago?

239
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:42,367
She wasn't
just any girl.

240
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:45,100
[katherine laughing]

241
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,100
Ha!

242
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,467
I win. what's my prize?

243
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,667
Damon: what would
you like it to be?

244
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:58,133
They extended
your leave?

245
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,467
I was simply
having too much fun

246
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,167
To return to battle.

247
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:04,434
Your commitment
to the confederacy
is inspiring.

248
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:07,701
Well, this works out
wonderfully for me.

249
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,701
How's that,
miss katherine?

250
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,367
Now i'll have both of you here
to keep me entertained.

251
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,100
First and foremost,

252
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll need someone to escort me
to the founder's ball.

253
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,434
With pleasure.
i would be honored.

254
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:25,534
The smart and kind
salvatore brothers
both coming to my rescue.

255
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:30,801
How will i ever choose?

256
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,334
Stefan:
she chose me.

257
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,834
I escorted her
to the ball

258
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:40,834
At the original
lockwood mansion.

259
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,667
The first founder's party...

260
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,467
Where you signed
the registry.

261
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:56,501
I didn't care that
i had gotten something
that my brother wanted.

262
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,234
I didn't even care
if it hurt him.

263
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:02,701
I only knew
that i wanted her.

264
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,801
So he was upset.

265
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:10,467
That's the thing
about damon.

266
00:17:11,868 --> 00:17:13,434
He doesn't get mad.

267
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:17,434
He just gets even.

268
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:19,868
Vicki: oh, man.

269
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:22,167
That shower was so great.

270
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,167
[music playing]

271
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,300
What did you give me?

272
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,601
Some blood.
you loved it.

273
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:36,167
I did?

274
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:38,367
Wait. i'm confused.

275
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,033
How did we get here?

276
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,601
Weetetn the woods.

277
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:45,267
You were drunk.
i attacked you.

278
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:47,234
Then i killed
all of your friends
and brought you here,

279
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,100
Gave you same blood.
you loved it.

280
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,267
And now we're
gonna party till
the sun goes down.

281
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:54,100
Ok.

282
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,467
Um, but first,
can i have another hit?

283
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:58,667
That blood was so good.

284
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,968
Only if i can.

285
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:13,868
Stefan:
what damon wants,
damon usually gets.

286
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:16,534
I didn't know it
at t time, but...

287
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:18,400
Turns out that night...

288
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,601
Katherine was
with him, too.

289
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,501
So he stole her from you,
not the other way around?

290
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:32,434
Turns out she
wasn't ours to steal.

291
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:53,400
I will love you forever.

292
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,801
Forever is a very long time,
you know.

293
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,334
Not long enough.

294
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,000
Good morning.

295

Clear the room, please.

296
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
You're upset.

297
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:41,868
Your face,

298
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:43,567
It was like a demon.

299
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:44,868
But you're
not afraid.

300
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:47,133
Get away from me.
get away.

301
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,133
It doesn't
change the way
you feel about me.

302
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:52,601
You will
not tell anyone.

303
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:54,267
I--
shh.

304
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:57,100
We will go on
exactly as we have.

305
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,000
Yes.

306
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,367
We will go on.

307
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,167
Heh heh.

308
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:07,567
You have no idea
of the future i have
planned for us, stefan--

309
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,934
You, me, and damon.

310
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:14,334
No rules.

311
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:16,901
Stefan: she could control
my mind and damon's.

312
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:20,667
She compelled each of us
to keep the secret
from the other.

313
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:24,334
She wanted all of us
to be together forever.

314
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:27,934
Didn't work out
that way, but...

315
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:33,901
Damon and i, looks like
we're stuck with each other...

316
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,834
Like it or not.

317
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,534
Is that damon's ring?

318
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,868
I took it from him,
but i have to give it back.

319
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,067
No. don't, stefan.
keep it hidden.

320
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,734
elena, if i don't
give it to him,

321
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:50,767
He'll retaliate in the only way
that he knows he can hurt me.

322
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:51,901
And how is that?

323
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:55,100
By hurting you.

A few townies.
notorious druggies.

327
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,100
I suppose that'll
make it easy for people
to buy the story.

328
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,701
And vicki donovan?

329
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:13,133
She's not one
of the deceased.

330
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,200
Where the hell is she?

331
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,634
I wish i knew.

332
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:17,033
Sorry i'm late.

That's it?

337
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,801
Yes. that's it.

338
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:55,801
[music playing]

339
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:08,534
I am so over tyler,
so over him.

340
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:10,200
I knew from the beginning

341
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
That i was only
a piece of ass to him,

342
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,868
But i thought maybe
if he got to know me better,
he might see something more.

343
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,467
But no.

344
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:17,834
Now, jeremy,
on the other hand,

345
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:20,834
That's all he's ever seen in me
is something more,

346
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,167
And i like that.

347
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,767
Jeremy, huh?

348
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,667
Elena's brother?

349
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,601
Yeah. yeah.

350
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:29,434
So, elena used to date
my brother,

351
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:30,667
And they were
always together,

352
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,367
So jeremy would always
be hanging around

353
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:33,467
And crushing on me and--

354
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:36,000
Hey, why don't you
have a girlfriend?

355
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,801
You're, like,
totally cool
and so hot.

356
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:38,968
I know.

357
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:40,801
Don't you wanna be in love?

358
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:42,200
I've been in love.

359
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,501
It's painful and pointless
and overrated.

360
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:48,300
Except when it isn't.

361
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,734
No more talking.

362
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,501

I don't remember my dad,
bufrom what i gather,

369
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:08,901
He's not worth
remembering.

370

Your life is
so pathetic.

371
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:13,634
Yeah. i mean,
i'm the screwed-up one.

Matt's got it so easy.
he's the golden boy.

373
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:19,734
I mean, he's gonna get
a football scholarship

374
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:23,667
And marry elena
and have a lawn mower
and some babies,

375
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:27,667
and when
i think of my future,
i just come up blank.

00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,467
You are so damaged.

Nope, none.

I think i know
what can help you.

So what's that?

Over at the old
mystic falls cemetery.

what's wrong with her?

Yep.

She's transitioning.

00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:39,901
Damon must have gotten to her.
she's new.

502
00:30:39,901 --> 00:30:42,100
She hasn't completed
her transformation yet.

503
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,567
H-how does she do that?

504
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:49,767
She has to feed
on human blood.

505
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:53,234
And what if
she doesn't?

506
00:30:55,868 --> 00:30:57,400
She'll die.

507
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:05,201

a few hours.

So when is
she gonna know?

Right now, she doesn't
remember anything.

512
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:13,500
A part of her
is still human,

513

But slowly,
the deeper she gets
into the transition,

514
00:31:16,101 --> 00:31:18,167
the memories will start
to come back,

515
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,400
And then
she'll know she has
to make the choice.

516

she just freaked out.

go look for her.

fessed up.

I'm not gonna kill you
right now.

00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:39,701
5 bodies
all drained of blood.

22
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,100
They've come back.

23
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,901
Aah!

24
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,934
You just don't
wanna die, do you?

25
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,367
Stefan:
she's transitioning.

26
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:47,734
Into what?
a vampire.

27
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:48,834
I don't know
what's wrong with her.

28
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,501
She'll be fine.
vicki: no.

29
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:51,767
We'll all be fine.

30
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:52,968
Vicki!

31
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:54,367
I will make sure that
she does not hurt anybody,

32
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:55,567
Elena, I promise you.

33
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:06,834
[clunk]

34
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:33,434
Hi, ty.

35
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:34,434
Whoa!

36
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:35,934
Vicki?

37
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:39,334
Everyone's
looking for you.

38
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:40,334
I know.

39
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,634
What's wrong, vic?

40
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,067
I'm so cold.

41
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,133
Are you on drugs?

42
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,434
Everyone thinks
you're off on a bender.

43
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:46,701
I wish.

44
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,501
What happened
in those woods, vicki?

45
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:49,868
Those kids
that were killed,

46
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,501
What did you see?

47
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,033
I'm so scared.

48
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,834
Come here.

49
00:01:58,834 --> 00:01:59,868
It's ok.

50
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:01,934
I'll take you home.

51
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,734
I can't control it.

52
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:04,701
Control what?

53
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,968
I am so hungry, ty.

54
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,934
And it won't go away.

55
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:13,133
What are you on?
what drugs did you take?

56
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:17,968
I want it.
I'm so hungry, ty.

57
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:20,767
Ok, look, I'll get you
something to eat.
just sit back.

58
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,033
Look, let's just
get you home. vicki!

59
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,467
Ok, what is
wrong with you?

60
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,434
Aah! let go of me!

61
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:38,033
What's going on
here, stefan?
what's wrong with her?

62
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,033
You don't talk.

63
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,334
Screw you, dude.

64
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,167
"dude"? really?
"dude"?

65
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,300
Damon, don't.

66
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,667
Oh, come on.
who's gonna miss
this idiot?

67
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,434
Ohh! don't you hurt him.

68
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,667
Forget what you
saw here tonight.

69
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:53,901
None of us
were here.

71
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:43,903
Sorry.
Oh, no, it's cool, I'm done.

72
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:47,504
You're up early.
Where are you going?

73
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:48,834
Police station.
they're organizing

74
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,567
The search party
for vicki, so...

75
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,867
Wait. shouldn't you
be going to school?

76
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,700
What? you're kidding me, right?

77
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,034
You shouldn't
skip school.

78
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:58,034
If they find her,
we'll know.

79
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,168
That's what
cellphones are for.

80
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:00,169
Yeah, your lips keep movin'.
I don't know why.

81
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,968
[cellphone rings]

82
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:19,868
Yeah?

83
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:20,901
Matty?

84
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:23,267
Vicki, where are you?
are you ok?

85
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:24,400
Yeah. I'm ok.

86
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,501
Tell me where you are,
and I'll come get you.

87
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,901
No. matty, I just need some time
to figure things out.

88
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:32,634
Just know that I'm ok,
ok?

89
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:33,801
Please don't
worry about me.

90
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:34,767
[beep]

91
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:42,367
I don't understand why I have
to stay cooped up here.

92
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,467
Why can't
I just go home?

93
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,634
Because you're changing,
vicki,

94
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,167
And it's not something
you wanna do alone.

95
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:50,534
There's nothin' about
that logan guy I killed in here,

96
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:52,868
Not a word.

97
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:54,467
Someone's
covering it up.

98
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,634
What is that?

99
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:57,734
This is a very special,
very old compass.

100
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,334
What was logan fell doing with it?
aren't you curious?

101
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,567
Well, if you're so worried
that somebody's onto you,

102
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,300
Why don't you
just leave town, damon?

103
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,534
We should all
be worried.

104
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:09,200
Hey, um, I'm hungry.
do you have anything to eat?

105
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:13,734
Here.

106
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:16,801
What is it?

107
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:17,901
It's what you're craving.

108
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,968
Heh. don't lie
to the girl.

109
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,467
It's so not
what you're craving,

110
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:23,467
But it'll do
in a pinch, right, stef?

111
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:24,567
What is it?

112
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,133
Yeah, what is it?
is it skunk?

113
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,968
Saint bernard? bambi?

114
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:29,367
Go on.
give it a try.

115
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,033
She's new.
she needs people blood.

116
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,067
she can't sustain
on that stuff.

117
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,634
Yeah, why can't I
have people blood?
yeah.

118
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,801
Because it's wrong
to pray on innocent
people, vicki.

119
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:39,601
You don't have to kill
to feed.

120
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:40,934
Just find someone
really tasty

121
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:43,234
And then erase
their memory afterwards.
it's so easy.

122
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:45,133
No, no, no.
there's no guarantee

123
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,501
That you can
control yourself, ok?

124
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:47,901
It takes years
to learn that.

125
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,400
You could easily
kill somebody,

126
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
And then you have to
carry that with you for
the rest of your life,

127
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Which, if I haven't made clear,
is eternity.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,100
Don't listen to him.

129
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,834
He walks on a moral plane
way out of our eye line.

130
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,767
I say snatch, eat, erase.

131
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:02,968
Hey, look at me.

132
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:05,033
We choose
our own path.

133
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:08,601
Our values and our actions,
they define who we are.

134
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,968
Ok, count deepak.

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,667
I am outta here.

136
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,033
Can I have
some more?

137
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,801
[bell rings]

138
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,901
Is stefan here?

139
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,033
Yep.

140
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,734
Where is he?

141
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:45,734
And good morning
to you, little miss
"I'm on a mission."

142
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:48,601
How can you be
so arrogant and glib

143
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,334
After everything
that you've done?

144
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:53,133
And how can you be
so brave and stupid

145
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,300
To call a vampire
arrogant and glib?

146
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,968
If you wanted me dead,
I'd be dead.

147
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:58,067
Yes, you would.

148
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,167
But I'm not.
yet.

149
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,968
Where is stefan?

150
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:03,968
He's upstairs

151
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:06,100
Singing
"the rain in spain."

152
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,167
Knock yourself out.

153
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:22,133
Stefan.

154
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,667
[creak]

155
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:25,767
Stefan?

156
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:26,901
Yes.

157
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,501
Where is vicki?

158
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,567
She's upstairs.

159
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,634
What happens now?

160
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:40,367
Because my brother is
out there searching for her
with the rest of the town.

161
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,734
What do I tell him?

162
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:43,901
I'm working
with her, but it's
gonna take time.

163
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,767
She's a very volatile
and impulsive
personality.

164
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,200
She's a drug user.
I mean, all that's

165
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Gonna play a part
in how she responds
to this.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,300
So she's a vampire
with issues?

167
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,133
what am I supposed to do?

168
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:58,000
Because I am lying
to everyone that I care about.
what's gonna happen to her?

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,267
I'm gonna keep her
here with me until
I know that she's safe.

170
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,300
Vicki: how long is that?

171
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,567
We can talk
about that later.

172
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:11,501
Hey, vicki, how are you?

173
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,267
How am I?

174
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,400
You're kidding, right?

175
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:24,000
Was our family burned
in the witch trials?

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,934
No, the girls that
were persecuted in salem
were entirely innocent.

177
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:32,968
You have to have
more than ignorance
to trap a real witch.

178
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:35,634
How did we end up
in mystic falls?

179
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:40,400
Our family
fled salem in 1692
and relocated here.

180
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,834
our ancestors lived
in secrecy for over
a hundred years.

181
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,834
It's important
that we still do.

182
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:49,167
Well, grams, everybody
knows you're a witch.

183
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,234
They also know
it's absurd,

184
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:52,901
Can't be true.

185
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,567
I'm just
a kooky lady

186
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,734
That teaches occult
at the university.

187
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,133
No one
really believes.

188
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,901
They just poke fun.

189
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,334
And let 'em.

190
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,300
Just don't let 'em
know the truth.

191
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,701
[sighs]

192
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,467
Where's the witchcraft?

193
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:10,467
I mean, you've been
talking history for 2 days.

194
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,801
I wanna get
to the fun part.

195
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,901
It's not meant
to be fun.

196
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,868
it's real,
and it's serious,

197
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:19,801
And you must
understand it before
you practice it.

198
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:24,901
Aren't you
late for school?

199
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,601
We never should have
trusted that logan...

200
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,133
Weasel with the watch.

201
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,467
How many are
we dealing with?

202
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:51,701
Well, the coroner
thinks one.

203
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:53,467
Somethinabout
the wound radius
and the jaw pattern.

204
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,467
Are we in danger?

205
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:56,033
I mean, if it
found the watch,

206
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,400
Then it knows we know,
and could it come after us?

207
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,934
A-and should I even
be saying, "it"?

208
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,934
Or--or is it
a he or a she?

209
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,701
If it has any historical
knowledge of the town,

210
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,300
Then it'll know where
the watch came from,

211
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,434
So, yes, we could
very much be in danger.

212
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:08,834
So what do we do?

213
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,934
Just keep it quiet.
we can't have

214
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:12,734
The entire town
aware of this.

215
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:15,434
We need to find him
before he finds us.

216
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:17,400
[music playing]

217
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,601
Hey, man.

218
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey.

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,501
I heard they're putting together
a search party for vicki.

220
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,400
She just called.
she's ok.

221
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,067
Oh, good.

222
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:34,567
That's great. I figured
you must have been goin'
out of your mind.

223
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,033
Little bit, yeah.

224
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:37,601
I was just gonna offer,

225
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,534
You know, if there's
anything I could do.

226
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,901
I appreciate it.

227
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:44,067
I have got your costume.

228
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,033
It's all here.

229
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,167
Seriously?

230
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,601
Come on.

231
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:53,501
Can someone please be excited
that it's halloween?

232
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,801
I just wanna have fun,
you know,

233
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:59,701
Just some silly,
fluffy, damon-free fun.

234
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,767
Hey, isn't this the one
you got from damon?

235
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:04,234
Yep. wear it.
toss it. I don't care.

236
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:06,133
I just want it gone.

237
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,267
Hey, have you seen elena?

238
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,667
Do we know
what she's wearing?

239
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,234
I was with grams
all weekend.

240
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,567
I haven't
talked to her.

241
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,033
Maybe she's
with stefan.

242
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,701
Riding to his castle
on his white horse.

243
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,534
Don't be bitter.
it provokes wrinkles.

244
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:18,667
[scoffs]

245
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:23,234
Coffee is our friend.
it's the caffeine.

246
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:24,634
It circulates
through our veins,

247
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:28,868
And it warms our body
so we're not so cold
to the touch.

248
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:31,100
Well, what if I wanna
drink human blood?

249
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,767
You're gonna have
to learn to live
with that urge

250
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:36,901
And fight it
on a daily basis
one day at a time.

251
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:38,667
Oh, god, don't start
with that whole 12 steps thing.

252
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,801
School counselor
has been down that road,

253
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,367
And it doesn't
work for me.

254
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,400
It can work.
it's your choice, vicki.

255
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,367
So you've never
tasted human blood?

256
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:53,200
Not in a long time.

257
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
How long?

258
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,501
Years and years.

259
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,567
I'm not proud
of my past behavior.

260
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:03,534
[sighs] does this
sketchy feeling ever go away?

261
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:05,434
It's like I have
a massive hangover.

262
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,167
This daylight thing
is a bitch.

263
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:09,234
[sighs] I need more blood.

264
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:10,834
Where's your bathroom?
I have to pee.

265
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:13,367
Why do I have to pee?
I thought I was dead.

266
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,467
I'm going to, uh--

267
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,467
I'm gonna get her
some more.

268
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:23,501
All right.

269
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:25,234
I'll be quick.

270
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,868
[sighs] false alarm.

271
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:41,801
My body's feeling
really funky.

272
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:44,467
It's a good funk,
but it's weird.

273
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:45,601
Hmm.

274
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:47,267
Who are you calling?

275
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,968
Jeremy.

276
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,701
Vicki, you can't
see jeremy anymore.

277
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:52,901
Oh, come on.
don't you start.

278
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,434
I'm gonna see
whoever I wanna see.

279
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:55,801
Even though
you could hurt him?

280
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:56,968
I would never
hurt jeremy.

281
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,434
I know you think that,

282
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:00,234
But I can't
take that risk.

283
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:02,534
You're gonna have
to let jeremy go now.

284
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:03,734
Ohohreally?

285
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:05,968
And how long
have you been preparing

286
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:07,467
A "you're not
good enough" speech?

287
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,467
I'm presuming it predates
the whole vampire thing.

288
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:14,167
All I'm saying is jeremy
is not getting involved
in any of this.

289
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,334
I mean it, vicki.

290
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:17,434
Or what?

291
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,734
Let's get one thing straight,
you perky little bitch.

292
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:26,400
You had my brother whipped
for 15 years,

293
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,734
15 years,
and then you dumped him.

294
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:33,400
When I look at you,
that is all I see,
just so you know.

295
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,634
And I'm gonna see jeremy
whenever I wanna see jeremy,

296
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,968
Because I have
some fun new toys to play with,

297
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:42,667
And I won't think twice about
ripping your little head off.

298
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,167
You got it?

299
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,734
[coughs]

300
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:55,968
She threatened me.

301
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,567
She's on edge.

302
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,901
Imagine every sense
in your body operating
at super speed.

303
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:01,767
I mean, she's uncomfortable
in her own skin,

304
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,834
And then when you
throw in her other issues--

305
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,467
How long
before it settles?

306
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:06,968
Hours? days? weeks?

307
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:08,300
There's no rule book.

308
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,033
Well, how long
before you learned
to control it?

309
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,634
A while,

310
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:12,834
But I didn't have
anybody helping me.

311
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:14,167
I had to do it
on my own.

312
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,167
The thing is it's hard
to resist certain people,

313
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,467
Especially when you're new.

314
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:20,501
it's difficult
to separate your feelings.

315
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:25,834
Love, lust, anger, desire--
it can all blur into
one urge, hunger.

316
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,367
What does that mean?

317
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,834
It means that jeremy
can't see her,

318
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,834
Not now. she might not
be able to resist him,

319
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:32,267
And she could hurt him.

320
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:34,334
Or worse.

321
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:36,667
I'm not gonna
let anybody get hurt.

322
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:39,834
I need to get going.

323
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:40,868
Elena--

324
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:42,000
Please, stefan.

325
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,934
There's only
so much I can take.

326
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,734
[music playing]

327
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,868
What are you doing?

328
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:59,267
Just contemplating
the next hundred years.

329
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:08,367
Why did you do it?

330
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,701
I was...

331
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,667
Bored.

332
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:17,200
You did this to me
out of boredom?

333
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,534
It's one of
the pitfalls
of eternity.

334
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:24,534
Now I'm bored.

335
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:25,968
And all I can
think about is blood.

336
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:26,968
I just want some blood.

337
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,033
I can't think
about anything else.

338
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,033
What is that about?

339
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:30,767
That'll ease up.

340
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:33,200
You've just been
cooped up all day.

341
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,334
Let's go.

342
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,167
Where?

343
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,200
Your life was pathetic.

344
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,734
Your afterlife
doesn't have to be.

345
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,684
What are you doing?

346
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:49,283
She's been cooped up
in your room all day.

347
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,450
She's not anne frank.

348
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,484
No, no, no.
hey, hey...

349
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,751
Now's not the time
for this.

350
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,218
If you're gonna
teach her, teach her.

351
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,517
Show her
what it's all about.

352
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:56,884
She could hurt someone.

353
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:58,917
I'm not takin' her
to disneyland.

354
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,784
We're goin'
in the front yard.

355
00:16:01,784 --> 00:16:03,118
Come on.

356
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,650
Bad idea, damon.

357
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,017
She's a vampire,
stefan.

358
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:12,650
she should know
the perks.

359
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,617
Like what?

360
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:16,784

361
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:21,017

how did you do that?

00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,717
Come on, vicki.
live a little.

Hey.

00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:24,717
Get in here.

375
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:30,283
In a minute. I--

376
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,017
Please come inside.

377
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,717
I've been worried.

378
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,017
Thank god you're ok.

379
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:50,784
Where were you, vic?

380
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:53,118
It's no big deal.
drop it already.

381
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:55,450
3 people
were murdered
in the woods.

382
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,484
The cops were
lookin' for you.

383
00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:58,617
They wanna
question you.

384
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:00,017
They know where I live.

385
00:18:00,017 --> 00:18:01,951
Everyone was
worried about you.

386
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:03,684
I'm back now.
just let it go.

387
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:05,118
Are you kidding?

388
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,684
I had a freakin'
search party out
lookin' for you

389
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:09,984
While you were off
on your crazy drug trip,

390
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:11,717
And you want me
to let it go?

391
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:16,051
My head hurts.

392
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,550
You think?

393
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,684
[doorbell rings]

394
00:18:23,817 --> 00:18:25,350
Stefan, what are
you doing here?

395
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,617
Is vicki home?

396
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:28,084
Yeah.
can I see her, please?

397
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:30,118
Don't let him in.
I don't want him in here.

398
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:31,450
Did he do
something to you?

399
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,751
No. I just don't
want him in here.

400
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:34,450
Just let me come in
so I can explain myself.

401
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,650
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

402
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,984
But I think
you should leave now.

403
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:39,317
Matt--
please, now, stefan.

404
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:46,017
You gotta call me, vic.

405
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:49,017
I don't get it.
what's going on with you?

406
00:18:49,017 --> 00:18:50,917
Just--just call me, please.

407
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,517
Hey.

408
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,817
So, um, do you wanna
hang out tonight?

409
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:01,617
We could go to the, uh,
halloween thing at school.

410
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:02,617
Could be fun.

411
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:06,617
Cool. sure.
sounds, uh--sounds fun.

412
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:07,617
Can't wait.

413
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:09,851
I know you're upset
about vicki.

414
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:12,717
I heard she called matt.
but you can't be with her.

415
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:13,851
She needs to get better.

416
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:16,118
The best thing you can do
for her is let her go.

417
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,218
What does that even
mean, "let her go"?

418
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:19,584
Oh, ok, sure.

419
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,784
Since we're such
experts on letting
people go, right?

420
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:26,283
I know you may not see it,
but trust me, jer.
it's for the best.

421
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:31,517
Look, for months
after mom and dad died,

422
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:32,851
I felt like crap,

423
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:35,450
Like "nothing really
even mattered" crap.

424
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,951
Now all of a sudden,
I get these moments,

425
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:40,084
And things
started to feel just
a little bit better,

426
00:19:40,084 --> 00:19:40,151
And vicki was in every
single one of 'em.

427
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:45,717
So you may not see it,
but trust me.

428
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,617
Keeping me away
from her is not
for the best.

It's a lockwood special.

432
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,901

Until someone
is hot enough
to make out with.

435
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,534
Sounds like a plan.

436
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:56,234
How many martinis
have you had?

437
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:58,600
Ohh. don't start with me.

438
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,967
Can we go now?

439
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,333
We're late
for the halloween party.
let's go.

440
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,333
So go ahead.

441
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,901
I'd like to finish
my drink.

Heh.

00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:33,367
I love a good
"gatsby" look.

446
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:34,901
I've met you before.

Aren't you
caroline forbes'
boyfriend?

448
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:39,901
Ah, she had
a schoolgirl crush on me, but--

449
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:42,901
It was cute, but I had
to let her down easy.

450
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,567
It's damon, right?

451
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,067
Ah, you remember.

452
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:48,867
Well, you have a face
that's hard to forget.

453
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:51,834
What's your last name,
damon?

454
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:53,101

mm-hmm.

to zach?

Zach's my uncle.

How do you know zach?

459
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,967
Are you ok?

460
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:09,801
Yeah. I think there's
something in my eye.

461

Well, I know zach from
the founder's council.

462

You know, the salvatores
were one of this town's
original settlers.

463
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,767
Yes, they were.

464
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:22,767
I wasn't aware
that zach was a member.

465
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,600
I just recently
moved back home

466
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,867
And haven't really
had a chance to meet
many of his friends.

467
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:30,067
Well, will you tell him
to return my calls?

several messages.

about the vervain...

it makes it even harder

For you to keep yourself
under control.

what that's called?

get worse and worse

to the school.

It's not safe
out there alone.

10 vampires tonight.

Heh. well, if only
the real ones were
as easy to find.

How's that search goin'?

And anyone who arrived
during the day

543
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,268
Was eliminated
as a suspect.

Oh.

545
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,767
And all the rest were
just dead ends, so mmm.

Mmm.
mmm, I gotta go.

I lost track
of jeremy.
I was worried.

What's goin' on?

552
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:25,868
Hey. uh, everything's fine.

553
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:28,033
I told you
to quit bothering me.

554
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,567
No. vicki,
don't do this.

555
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:31,000
Matt, he won't
leave me alone.

556
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,501
You need
to back off, man.

557
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:33,567
Matt, it's--
it's ok.

558
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:34,567
No, it's not ok.

559
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:36,033
What the hell is
your problem?

00:26:37,968 --> 00:26:39,200

Ok.

569

So where--where'd
caroline run off to?

570
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,684
Do yourself a favor, damon,
and don't ask me about caroline.

575
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:39,017

I'm not giving it to you.

I did something.
I don't know.

631
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:20,818
It came from my necklace.

632
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:23,317
Where'd you get that?

633
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:24,983
It's part of my costume.

634
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:26,651
it's a piece of junk.

635
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:28,983
That piece of junk
belonged to one

Your great-great-

641
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,552
And there's your necklace.

[elena crying]

643
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:02,751
You should go.

644
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:04,284
I got this.

645
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:08,350
You did this.

646
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,217
This is your fault.

647
00:33:10,217 --> 00:33:12,050
You confuse me
for someone with remorse.

648
00:33:18,183 --> 00:33:20,884
None of this
matters to me,

649
00:33:20,884 --> 00:33:22,018
None of it.

650
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:24,918
People die around you.

651
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:26,417
How could it not matter?

652
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:29,050
It matters,
and you know it.

653
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,551
Mmm.

654
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:45,584
You need to leave.

655
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:51,050

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,450
Nothing. some idiot
with some fake blood got me.

664
00:34:35,317 --> 00:34:37,317
Is this
what I'm in for,

665
00:34:37,317 --> 00:34:39,284
A lifetime of
worrying about her?

666
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,150
You're a good brother, matt.

667
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:49,317
Maybe she went home.

668
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,050
Maybe.

669
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:34,417

00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:37,117

But instead, uh...

687
00:37:51,817 --> 00:37:53,251
How's he doin'?

688
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:55,351
He's a mess.

00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:58,050
I don't want him going
through this again.

690
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,351
He's just a kid.

Elena, what can I do? I--

692
00:38:01,817 --> 00:38:04,384
What can I do to help?
I'll do anything.

693
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:07,184
Can you make him forget?

Stefan, please.

696
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:14,417
I don't know how he'll
ever get past this.

697
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,417
I just want him
to forget everything
that happened.

698
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:21,084
If I did it, there's no
guarantee that it would work--

699
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:24,518
Because of who I am,
because of how I live.

700
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:27,518
I don't have the ability
to do it right.

701
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:29,217
Damon: I can do it.

702
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:34,251
If this is
what you want...

703
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:40,050
I'll do it.

704
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,151
It's what I want.

705
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,584
What do you
want him to know?

706
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:04,750
I want you to tell him
that vicki left town

707
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,950
And she's not coming back,

708
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:12,384
That he shouldn't
look for her or
worry about her.

709
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:16,017
He's gonna miss her, but he
knows it's for the best.

710
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:39,184
Part of me wishes that
I could forget, too...

711
00:39:40,717 --> 00:39:42,917
Forget meeting you,

712
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:46,518
Finding out what
you are and everything
that's happened since.

713
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:50,650
If that's what you want.

714
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:55,017
Yes, it is.

715
00:39:58,351 --> 00:40:01,884
Because I don't
want it to be like this.

716
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:06,184
I don't wanna
feel like this.

717
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:12,850
But I can't.

718
00:40:14,284 --> 00:40:17,683
With everything
that's happened...

719
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:21,050
I can't lose the way
I feel about you.

720
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:35,750

00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:21,687
Hello, brother.

10
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:25,983
- She's transitioning.
- Into what?

11
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,985
- A vampire.
- Vicki, what the hell?!

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,420
- Why is everybody have to die on me?
- Can you make him forget?

13
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:34,523
I'll do it.
What do you want him to know?

14
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:38,652
That Vicki left town, he's gonna misss
her but he knows it's for the best.

15
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:51,117
Lexi?

16
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,492
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

17
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:57,517
How could you even ask that?

18
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:59,681
I missed you.

19
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:02,475
Happy birthday.

shot at me with wooden bullets,

24
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:17,386
{\pos(192,230)}I'd bail in under 60. And...

25
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,726
{\pos(192,230)}why is a news reporter
hunting vampires?

26
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:22,016
I don't know who knows about us.
That guy did.

27
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,770
{\pos(192,230)}There could be others. Do me a favor.
While you're here, please be careful.

28
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,025
Why stay?

29
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:29,835

It'll be a blast.

33
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,400
{\pos(192,230)}Do you think that
he would actually remember us?

34
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:42,620
- That was a pretty crazy weekend, huh?
- We can make him remember us.

35
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,956
Come on! Let's go.

36
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,709
{\pos(192,230)}- I mean, what's keeping you here?
- I told you.

37
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:50,374
Her name is Elena.

38
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,298
Well, let's hope she's better than
the last girl you got all sprung over.

39
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:57,040
You didn't even know Katherine.

40
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,870
{\pos(192,230)}Cause if I did, I'd kick her ass.

41
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,596
{\pos(192,230)}Little bitch. Speaking of... 

42
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:04,046
- Where's Damon?
- Inflicting misery somewhere.

43
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:09,025
{\pos(192,220)}You gonna be okay here alone?
I got some things I gotta take care of.

44
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,732
It's not exactly
like I can go anywhere.

45
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:15,861
And you and Damon are the only ones
with these nifty little daylight rings.

46
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:18,864
I have a mood ring
from '75. Trade ya?

47
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:21,575
{\pos(192,230)}Doesn't work that way
and you know it.

48
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,581
- I'm really glad that you came here.
- What are we doing

49
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,876
for your birthday? It's not every day
a guy turns 162 years old.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
{\pos(192,230)}Really?

51
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,504
Where did Vicki say she was going?

52
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:41,523
- She didn't.
- Did she tell her brother

53
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:44,170
{\pos(192,220)}- where she was going?
- She didn't say anything to me.

54
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:46,386
{\pos(192,220)}She told Jeremy to tell me
she was leaving town.

55
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:49,372
{\pos(192,220)}Is there anyone I can talk to that
may know what happened to her prior

56
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,716
{\pos(192,220)}- to her leaving town?
- Stefan Salvatore may know.

57
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:54,358
{\pos(192,220)}He came by the house to see her
but she wouldn't talk to him.

58
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,941
- What was he doing there?
- I was trying to help her.

59
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,682
{\pos(192,220)}I knew that Elena was worried
about her brother.

60
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,908
{\pos(192,220)}He was dating Vicki and she had
a drug problem, so I tried to help.

61
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,428
{\pos(192,220)}So you got involved
because Elena asked you to?

62
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:07,115
{\pos(192,220)}I asked Stefan to help.

63
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,293
{\pos(192,220)}I thought that by helping Vicki,
he was helping my brother.

64
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:13,374
{\pos(192,220)}What was her behavior like
those last few days before she left?

65
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:14,599
{\pos(192,220)}Up and down.

66
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:16,958
{\pos(192,220)}Very sketchy, like...

67
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,259
{\pos(192,220)}she was coming down
from some major party.

68
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,027
- Any signs of aggression or violence?
- Not that I remember.

69
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:27,641
{\pos(192,220)}So you believe
Vicki really has left town?

70
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll miss her, but...

71
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,448
I think it's for the best.

72
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,159
I was tryin' to help her, Matt.
That's all.

73
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,172
I'll meet you guys at the car.

74
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:07,936
You okay?

75
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,454
I don't think the sheriff
suspected anything.

76
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,988
Jeremy had no memory at all.

77
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:13,979
All he knew was what
Damon made him know.

78
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,182
Thank you.

79
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:19,818
I can't do this, Stefan.

80
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,039
Every time I look at Matt or Jeremy,

81
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,991
all I think is that
Vicki is never gonna come back,

82
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,614
And they'll never know why.

83
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:31,251
Around you, people get hurt
and people die and I just...

84
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:32,748
It's just too much...

85
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:36,801
Why don't we go somewhere
and talk about it?

86
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:40,013
You have to stay away from me.

87
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,692
What an unexpected surprise.

88
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:02,366
Unexpected surprise?

89
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,030
I think the wrong brother
went back to high school.

90
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,992
- How long you here for?
- Just for Stefan's b-Day.

91
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,609
You mean you didn't come
all this way to see me?

92
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,914
That's it, Damon.
After a century, I finally realized

93
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,182
death means nothing without you.

94
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,751
Do me.

95
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,588
Why are you so mean to me?

96
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:24,466
Have you met you?
You're not a nice person.

97
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:28,137
- Because I'm a vampire.
- But you're only the bad parts.

98
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,180
Teach me to be good.

99
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,609
I'm older, and that means stronger.

100
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,978
- Sorry.
- Don't ruin my time with Stefan,

101
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,604
cause I'll hurt you.

102
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:39,815
And you know I can do it.

103
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:52,415
You leavin'?

104
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,169
Dad doesn't like it
when I stay here too much.

105
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:58,042
Because he misses you,
or because he doesn't trust me?

106
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:01,140
Your father's problem
is he lacks imagination.

107
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:04,506
He thinks I fill your head
with all my witchy juju.

108
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,425
- He's right.
- He's always right.

109
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:08,302
That's his other problem.

110
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:11,465
You need to be wearin' that.

111
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,071
I gotta get it back to Caroline.
It doesn't belong to me.

112
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:16,889
Yes, it does. It was your ancestor's
and now it's yours.

113
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:19,271
Emily was your ancestor, too.
Why don't you wear it?

114
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,816
It didn't find me. It found you,
protected you.

115
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,656
A witch's talisman
is a powerful tool.

116
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,545
Don't be givin' that back
to anybody.

117
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:37,717
I just wish it was prettier.

118
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,345
You're wallowing.

119
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:44,885
So are you.

120
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,883
My wallow is legitimate.
I was dumped.

121
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,430
- Yeah. Well, Logan's a jerk.
- You didin't get a brushoff e-mail

122
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,148
saying, "I'm leaving town.
See ya."

123
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,101
- Wanna keep it down over there?
- Why? What are you doing?

124
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,269
Homework.

125
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:01,522
Since when do you do homework?

126
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,690
I gotta finish this. I'm way behind
and I have a quiz tomorrow, so...

127
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:09,694
What do you think?
Alien?

128
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,429
Some sort of replicant.

129
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,567
He can hear you.

130
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,049
Send him in.

131
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,424
Mr. Salvatore, come on in.

132
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,467
- Could you get the door for me?
- Sure.

133
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,428
I understand from Mrs. Lockwood
that your uncle's out of town.

134
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:37,133
Yes, he is.
But I spoke with Zach.

135
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:40,865
He filled me in and asked
if I could bring this to you.

136
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:53,794
Vervain.

137
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,702
That's all we have at the moment.
I hope it's enough.

138
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:02,749
It's a small circle...

139
00:09:03,273 --> 00:09:05,502
Founding families,
a few city officials.

140
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,213
And your deputies, of course, right?

141
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,466
Are we any closer?

142
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:14,386
I think our facts are wrong.

143
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:19,057
We've always believed that vampires
can only come out in the dark.

144
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,875
What if that's changed?

145
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,742
Is that even possible?

146
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,980
We've exhausted every other option.

147
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,334
We have to consider the vampire
may be walking around during the day

148
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,009
right in front of us.

149
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:37,326
- So what's the next step?
- We're now looking at anyone

150
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,871
new to town since the deaths began.

151
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,748
Should turn up a suspect or two.

152
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,209
And I of course
will do anything I can to help.

153
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:52,772
{\PUB}You up?

154
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,978
Why haven't you called me back?

155
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:04,436
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,855
{\pos(150,268)}Are you gonna stay in there forever?

157
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:09,524
Move over.

158
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,157
I'm officially worried.

159
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,628
What's going on?

160
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:23,589
I'm tired of thinking...

161
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,512
of talking. I...

162
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,585
Can I get a one-line version so
I can at least pretend to be helpful?

163
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,353
Stefan and I broke up.

164
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,430
I'm so sorry.

165
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:35,914
Are you okay?
Right. Stupid question.

166
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,680
I know I've been kind of MIA

167
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,127
when you need me the most.

168
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,142
I suck.

169
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,160
You wanna make it up to me?

170
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,038
Get my mind off of it.

171
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:53,277
Just remember you asked for it.

172
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:08,542
Be patient.

173
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,557
I need to swear you to secrecy.

174
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:15,969
It's kind of a bad week
for that kind of stuff.

175
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,467
Swear, cause I'm not supposed
to be showing you this.

176
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:20,804
- I swear.
- There's no windows open, right?

177
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,510
- Right.
- There's no fan, 

178
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:26,351
- no air conditioning.
- None. What are you doing?

179
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,330
Grams just showed me this.
You're gonna love it.

180
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,455
You ready?

181
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,708
Bonnie, what's going on?

182
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:18,570
It's true, Elena,

183
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,155
Everything my grams told me.

184
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:22,741
It's impossible,

185
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,257
But it's true.

186
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:27,153
I'm a witch.

187
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,639
I believe you.

188
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,262
Look, dungeon boy,
I'm done being your little slave girl.

189
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,433
You seriously hurt me
and I will be damned if you think...

190
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:53,114
Oh, my God.
Where have you been?

191
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,872
- It's really good to see you.
- Much better.

192
00:12:56,997 --> 00:13:00,018
You wanna throw a party
here at the Grill tonight.

193
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:01,655
Why don't you do it?

194
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,574
Because then Stefan and his BFF
won't come. I need a lot of people,

195
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,592
big crowd. Invite everyone.

196
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:08,787
And why am I having this party?

197
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,249
Because you are gonna help me solve
this town's little vampire problem.

198
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,336
- And I want my crystal back.
- But Bonnie has it.

199
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:18,275
I know that.

200
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,756
Get it from her.

201
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,762
So, this Elena girl,
she'll come around. I'm sure of it.

202
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,065
Have you had sex yet?

203
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:29,687
Sex always works.

204
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,675
You'll rock her world so hard
with your vamp sex,

205
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,737
- She'll be yours forever.
- Yeah, but see, this isn't about

206
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:38,316
sex or... or compulsion

207
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,131
or any of our other tricks.

208
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:43,155
She has to want
to be with me on her own terms.

209
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,158
That sounded
all mature and grown-up.

210
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,034
I'm not getting any older.

211
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,795
Want some?

212
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:00,923
Thank you.

213
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:03,467
Relax. I didn't kill anyone for it.

214
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,385
This phlebotomist I went out
with a few times, he's my supplier.

215
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,432
Don't judge, okay?

216
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,271
Listen, I tried the animal diet.
Lasted 3 weeks.

217
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:15,714
Doesn't matter.
Cause if I started again...

218
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,289
- I don't know if...
- You could stop.

219
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:25,479
- I'd never judge you.
- I'm just jealous of your restraint.

220
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:28,033
I have none.
I delight in hedonism.

221
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,127
Speaking of which,

222
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:33,657
- What are we doing tonight?
- Funny you should ask.

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,874
Well, I wasn't asking you.

224
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,260
There's a party
at the Grill. You'll love it.

225
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:40,212
Banquettes, tacky wait staff.

226
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,797
All of Stefan's friends.

227
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,623
- I don't want a birthday party.
- Well, it's not for you.

228
00:14:44,748 --> 00:14:47,769
It's a party party. No one's
gonna know it's your birthday.

229
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:50,388
- Caroline's throwing it.
- Damon, stay away from Caroline.

230
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,306
We're friends. It's cool.

231
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:55,850
It's important for the town to see us
out and about like normal folk.

232
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,187
We need to blend.

233
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:04,194
I prefer mine at 98.6.

234
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:09,675
Let's go.

235
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,787
Please?

236
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:18,291
It's weird, huh? After all this time
joking about being psychic,

237
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,460
I really am a witch.

238
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:25,458
You don't think
I'm a freak now, do you?

239
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,983
No. Of course not.

240
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:30,393
I just... I don't understand, though.
If your grams asked you

241
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:32,722
to keep all this a secret,
why did you tell me?

242
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,490
You're my best friend.

243
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:36,601
I can't keep secrets from you.

244
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:43,316
I'm almost ready.

245
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:46,217
Can't believe you actually think
that we should go to this thing.

246
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:49,359
It's not like I'm asking you to run
outside midday without your ring.

247
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:51,533
I mean, seriously, it's a party.

248
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,571
A party that Damon wants us to go to,
you know. So my question is,

249
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,962
- "why?" I think he's up to something.
- Who cares?

250
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:00,458
I mean, what can he possibly do in front
of all those people in a public place?

251
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,587
He knows how to keep
a low profile, believe me.

252
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,048
So he'll behave.
Come on. One day a year, I get you,

253
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,316
One day that you're not brooding

254
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,303
and existing in your own head.

255
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:15,473
- It's my birthday, yeah?
- It's my day, and that guy

256
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,809
That jumped naked
in the Trevi Fountain and

257
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,029
got drunk on the Torch
of the Statue of Liberty, That guy

258
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:23,830
can take a break from all
of his worrying for one night

259
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,943
and go to a stupid party.
So quit your whining...

260
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,003
and go get ready.

261
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:33,193
Fine.

262
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,291
<i>It's open. Come on in.</i>

263
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:02,270
How...

264
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,667
- Who...
- I'm Elena.

265
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,406
- Who are you?
- Lexi.

266
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,490
A friend of Stefan's.

267
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:17,243
- Is he here?
- He's in the shower.

268
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:20,819
Do you wanna wait?

269
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:24,853
I'll tell him you stopped by.

270
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,078
That's okay.

271
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,969
Are you out of your freaking mind?

272
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,447
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,217
I just met Elena.

274
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:45,146
You have some serious
explaining to do.

275
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:51,962
{\Pub}You have some serious
emotional damage.

276
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,823
It's not what you think.
She's not Katherine.

277
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,208
Then they're related
because they could be twins.

278
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,107
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

279
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:02,009
- You didn't find out?
- No. Maybe I don't wanna know.

280
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:04,833
I have no desire
to tie Elena to Katherine.

281
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,514
The resemblance is what
drew me in but that's it.

282
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,504
Katherine and Elena may look
the same on the outside,

283
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:18,433
But on the inside,
they are completely different.

284
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:21,293
So Elena's not
a raging bitch then, huh?

285
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:25,918
No, Elena is...

286
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,816
Elena's warm,

287
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,270
And she's...

288
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,584
She's kind and she's caring
and she's selfless,

289
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:38,586
and it's real.

290
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:40,706
And...

291
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:43,398
honestly, when I'm around her...

292
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,524
I completely forget what I am.

293
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:50,848
You're in love with her.

294
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:57,446
Yeah, I am.

295
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,538
Amazing party, right?

296
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,356
Glad you thought of it.

297
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:32,337
- Well, are you having a good time?
- Do you have my crystal?

298
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,530
Then I'm not having a good time.

299
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,066
- Where's my brother?
- He said he'd meet me here.

300
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:51,291
Buy you a...

301
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:00,762
What are you doing rere?

302
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,619
Lexi said that you came by
and you seemed upset.

303
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:06,835
Right.

304
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,125
The girl in the towel.

305
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,590
The towel?

306
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:19,384
Not like that. No.
She's not exactly a girl. Lexi's...

307
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,512
She's 350 years old.

308
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,073
You mean she's a...

309
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:27,029
And she's my oldest friend.

310
00:20:27,154 --> 00:20:28,656
Nothing romantic.

311
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,144
Ever.

312
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:34,528
Okay, well...

313
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:37,277
she kept staring at me.
It was weird.

314
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:41,656
Well, you know,
I've talked about you

315
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,924
a lot, so...

316
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,143
guess she felt like she knew you.

317
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,049
So why'd you come by?

318
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:55,170
It was a mistake.

319
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,149
- Elena, talk to me.
- I can't.

320
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:05,930
Stefan, I can't
and that's the problem.

321
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,380
I'm keeping all these secrets
from everyone.

322
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,310
I can't even tell my best friend.

323
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,353
Do you know how hard that is?

324
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:17,172
It's like I need to talk to someone
but the only person I can talk to is

325
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,174
you... and...

326
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:24,706
I want you to know

327
00:21:25,844 --> 00:21:28,624
that I will always be here for you.

328
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:33,243
You can come to me
about anything, okay?

329
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:38,567
Well, thank you for coming by.

330
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,184
Do you need a ride
to the Grill tonight?

331
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:55,396
- Are you going to Caroline's party?
- Lexi's dragging me.

332
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:57,626
And...

333
00:21:58,429 --> 00:21:59,779
it's my birthday.

334
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,439
Really?

335
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,083
- Happy birthday then.
- Thank you.

336
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,108
Actually, I...

337
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:13,456
I think I'm gonna stay in tonight.

338
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,640
Well, have... have a good night.

339
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:46,990
I've been looking for you.

340
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,147
I'm totally sorry to do this.
I know it's so indian giver,

341
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:52,829
and we're not even supposed
to say that anymore, but

342
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:56,776
- I need my crystal back.
- Why? You said you hated it.

343
00:22:57,182 --> 00:23:00,852
Then I saw it on you
and I realized how great it is.

344
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:03,810
And I've got, like, three outfits
I can coordinate it with, so...

345
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:05,835
I can't give it back to you.

346
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:10,430
Well, I didn't want
to have to tell you this,

347
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,098
but I'm your friend.

348
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,184
When you wear it,
it makes you look fat.

349
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,602
There. I said it, but
it's because I'm your friend, so...

350
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:20,481
I'm sorry. Caroline, I can't.

351
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:24,360
What do you mean
that you can't, Bonnie? It's mine.

352
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,800
- I thought you said it was Damon's.
- It is.

353
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:29,429
So he's the one
who really wants it back?

354
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:32,544
Maybe. Just...

355
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,152
Are you wearing polyester?

356
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:39,556
You were really gonna pull it
from my neck?

357
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:42,717
What the hell is wrong with you?

358
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:02,135
Just hear me out?
Please?

359
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:04,442
I was just trying to help Vicki.

360
00:24:04,857 --> 00:24:07,737
I went through
something similar once.

361
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:11,644
I'm really sorry.

362
00:24:12,907 --> 00:24:15,953
Don't be.
It's not the first time she's run off.

363
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:18,942
Turns out
Vicki's just like her mother.

364
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,167
I can't count on either of them.

365
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:24,627
Thanks for trying.

366
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:33,434
Where is it?

367
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:35,473
Bonnie won't give it to me.

368
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,141
So rip it off her neck.

369
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,959
I tried. It shocked me.

370
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Damn it.
Why does it do that?

371
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,691
- I need that crystal.
- Why are you being like this?

372
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,886
I'm so good to you
and I'd do anying.

373
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,538
It's just some stupid necklace.

374
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,909
You are the only stupid thing here.

375
00:24:56,238 --> 00:24:57,338
And shallow.

376
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,285
And useless.

377
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,047
Okay, I'm gonna need
a little more foot movement.

378
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:11,137
Yeah, I'm not really interested
in making a fool out of myself.

379
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:12,911
Come on. You're not that bad.

380
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:15,972
Do me a favor. Tell me if you see
Damon with his camera phone.

381
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,097
Right.

382
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:27,155
<i>- Where are we going?
- No one's gonna see us...</i>

383
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,930
- Did you hear something?
- No. It's cool.

384
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:55,187
There's no one coming down here.

385
00:26:08,215 --> 00:26:09,215
{\PUB}Nice!

386
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:34,258
Stefan smiles.

387
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,353
Alert the media.

388
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:39,931
You haven't given him
a lot of reasons to be happy lately.

389
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,899
You're right. Poor Stefan.

390
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:46,429
Persecuted throughout eternity
by his depraved brother.

391
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,950
Does it get tiring
being so righteous?

392
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,302
It flares up
in the presence of psychopaths.

393
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:59,242
Well, consider
this psychopath's feelings hurt.

394
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,329
What did you do to my brother?

395
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,374
I'm gonna need
a less vague question.

396
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:09,016
When you did what you did
to Jeremy's memory of Vicki,

397
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:12,651
- What else did you do to him?
- You asked me

398
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:15,209
to take away
his memory of fangs and...

399
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,934
and all the bad stuff.

400
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:19,345
You wanted me
to take away his suffering.

401
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,986
But he's acting different.

402
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:23,766
He seems okay with everything
and a little too okay.

403
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,894
I mean, he's studying. He's not
doing drugs. He's not drinking.

404
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:30,021
Are you sure
you didn't do something else?

405
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:32,477
I took away his suffering.

406
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:38,573
- Don't talk to me.
- Don't do that. Let me explain.

407
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,575
What is there to explain?
You got what you wanted...

408
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,537
And something that doesn't even
belong to you, by the way.

409
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,623
And I get called a shallow,
useless waste of space.

410
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,807
- Who said that to you?
- Who do you think?

411
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:52,455
You know that's not true.
Don't let him treat you like that.

412
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,339
As opposed to how
my best friend treats me.

413
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,117
Two shots of tequila.

414
00:28:35,853 --> 00:28:37,153
Make that three.

415
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,067
I need to see some ID.

416
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,770
No, you don't.

417
00:28:46,454 --> 00:28:48,142
- That'll be...
- Free.

418
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:50,811
- On the house.
- Thanks.

419
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,071
The famous Elena.

420
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:02,977
Towel girl.

421
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:06,002
I've been called worse.
Here.

422
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,131
I didn't know
that you guys could drink.

423
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:12,406
Yeah. It helps curb the cravings,

424
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:15,211
But makes for a lot of lushy vamps.

425
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,761
I've never seen Stefan drunk.

426
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,842
- He always seems so...
- Uptight?

427
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:25,819
But not with you.

428
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,211
That's the benefit of knowing
someone for over 100 years.

429
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:30,684
You can just be yourself.

430
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:34,458
- He can't be himself with me.
- Well, not yet.

431
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,833
The first step was him telling you.

432
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,609
The rest comes with time.

433
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:41,442
You seem so sure.

434
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,383
The love of my life was human.

435
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:51,359
He went through what
I imagine you're going through...

436
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:53,467
Denial, anger, et cetera.

437
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:56,531
But at the end of the day,

438
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:59,269
love really did conquer all.

439
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:06,293
Are you gonna drink that?

440
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:08,435
Go for it.

441
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:13,199
I'm scared.

442
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:16,772
But you're here...

443
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,432
cause you're crazy about him.

444
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,485
I get it, okay? I mean,

445
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:24,045
what's not to love?

446
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:25,558
Listen.

447
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,966
Take it from someone
who's been around a long time.

448
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:31,619
When it's real, you can't walk away.

449
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:43,174
It was really nice meeting you.

450
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:54,786
Yep, I drank yours.

451
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
Sorry.

452
00:30:58,688 --> 00:30:59,688
Thank you.

453
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,010
You weren't supposed
to be listening.

454
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,481
I was feeling epic.

455
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,783
Whatever.

456
00:31:21,622 --> 00:31:23,122
Keep this contained.

457
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:24,903
That's not all.

458
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:38,938
Did you see what did this?

459
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:45,152
Tell me everything you saw.

460
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,711
{\PUB}You came.

461
00:32:03,817 --> 00:32:07,550
{\pos(150,268)}I couldn't miss your hundredth and...
whatever birthday.

462
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:22,868
I slim... I'm slipped.

463
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:25,454
I slipped.

464
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:26,779
Hammered, huh?

465
00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:29,135
Well...

466
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:32,492
a very nice but not handsome

467
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,160
bartender
was very kind to me tonight.

468
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,014
Unlike the rest
of the global humanverse.

469
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,679
Are those curly fries?

470
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:47,469
Coffee for the drunk girl.

471
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:52,203
Bad night, huh?

472
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:54,638
Baddest.

473
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,192
Am I shallow?

474
00:32:58,864 --> 00:33:01,562
- Is that a trick question?
- I don't mean to be.

475
00:33:02,654 --> 00:33:03,814
I wanna be deep.

476
00:33:04,306 --> 00:33:06,062
I wanna be, like...

477
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:07,782
the abyss deep.

478
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,990
No offense, Care, but
deep's really not your scene.

479
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:16,888
That's true.

480
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,510
I'm shallow.

481
00:33:20,673 --> 00:33:22,373
I am worse than shallow.

482
00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:24,984
I'm a kiddie pool.

483
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,720
You're not a kiddie pool.

484
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,090
You're not a kiddie pool.

485
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:33,167
Can I just go home?

486
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:36,822
I'll take you. Come on.

487
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,733
You're okay. She's all right.
Hold still. Hold still.

488
00:33:57,847 --> 00:33:59,047
What happened?

489
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:01,049
- Is she okay?
- Like you care.

490
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,082
- She's drunk?
- As a skunk.

491
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:05,756
Are they serving you in there?

492
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:09,879
I'll take her home. It's on my way.
I haven't been drinking.

493
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,675
I would appreciate that, Matt.
Thank you.

494
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:15,277
You and I will discuss this later.

495
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:16,452
Can't wait.

496
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,927
Don't let anybody else leave.

497
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,709
All right, the shots are a bribe.
I need you to answer a question.

498
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,250
What are you really doing
in Mystic Falls?

499
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,616
Have you tried the Brittle?
It wins awards.

500
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,934
Cut the crap.

501
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,958
I have a diabolical master plan.

502
00:34:48,312 --> 00:34:49,362
What is it?

503
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:52,772
Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be
very diabolical, would it?

504
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,750
Look around.
Let me know if you see him.

505
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,829
What are you doing?

506
00:35:32,954 --> 00:35:36,054
Thank you for the vervain.
Now if you'll excuse me.

507
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:43,235
What is it?

508
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:48,334
Excuse me. Sorry.

509
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:53,777
Can't go out this way.

510
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:31,896
Why?

511
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:33,867
It's part of the plan.

512
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,374
You okay?

513
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:53,435
Thank you.

514
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,264
Get it in the car quickly.

515
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,257
{\PUB}Lady, I checked everyone's ID.

516
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:05,982
Apparently you didn't.

517
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:14,551
Pretty handy with that stake.

518
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:17,312
{\pos(150,268)}It just... reflex. I guess the

519
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,244
{\pos(150,268)}adrenaline kicked in.

520
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,419
This nightmare is finally over.

521
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:25,714
Caught a lucky break with that witness.
Without her, you wouldn't have been

522
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,339
- able to ID the vampire.
- Very lucky.

523
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:32,916
Well, thank you again.

524
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,401
You're welcome.

525
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,802
You gonna be okay?

526
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:13,624
Do you ever feel like there's not

527
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:16,752
a person in the world
that loves you?

528
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:20,464
Life can be a little rough.

529
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:22,616
I just wish...

530
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,302
What?

531
00:38:26,455 --> 00:38:28,005
Wish that life was...

532
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,309
different.

533
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:34,916
Yeah. Me, too.

534
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,155
Please...

535
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:49,703
don't leave me alone.

536
00:39:14,015 --> 00:39:15,215
He killed her.

537
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,187
He killed Zach.

538
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:19,512
He killed Tanner. He turned Vicki.

539
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:21,233
I have to kill him.

540
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,893
No. You can't do that.

541
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,411
Why are you trying to save him?

542
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:27,866
He's never gonna change.
Don't you see that?

543
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,383
- He's never gonna change.
- I'm not trying to save him.

544
00:39:30,508 --> 00:39:33,656
I'm trying to save you. You have no
idea what this will do to you. Please.

545
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:36,113
Everywhere that I go,
pain and death follow.

546
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:37,541
Damon follows me.

547
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,709
No more.

548
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:43,255
Please. Please, just talk to me.
Let me be here for you. Talk to me.

549
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,085
You were right to stay away from me.

550
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:10,146
Told you I'd take care of it.

551
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:31,219
Come on. I did this for you
to get them off our trail.

552
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,805
You never do anything
for anyone but yourself.

553
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:42,337
You missed.

554
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:45,569
You saved my life.

555
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,027
I'm sparing yours.

556
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,246
We're even.

557
00:40:50,376 --> 00:40:51,826
And now we're done.

558
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,087
It's coming.

She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
Hello, brother.

5
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:14,650
He killed Zach. He killed Tanner.
He turned Vicki.

6
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:16,557
I have to kill him.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,683
- You can't do that.
- You were right to stay away from me.

8
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:22,084
- What is that?
- A very important crystal.

9
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:25,382
That belonged to one of the most
powerful witches of our family.

10
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:27,485
- Emily Bennet.
- I want my crystal back.

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,350
- Bonnie has it.
- Get it from her.

12
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:31,614
Don't be giving that back
to anybody.

13
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:35,326
Today we're going to talk
about shadow reckoning.

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,944
This is a method of measuring
heights by the sun's shadow.

15
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,660
Let's say, for example,

16
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:43,501
that we're going to measure
the distance of the shadow.

17
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,585
We're gonna take
this measurement here,

18
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:49,240
Measure the length,

19
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:54,522
and we're going to multiply that
by the height of the source.

20
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:57,723
Building height can also
be measured, using a...

21
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:24,784
Hello?

22
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,717
Please help me.

23
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:16,218
Who are you?

24
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:17,843
I'm Emily.

25
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,047
You know that.

26
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,641
We're family.

Where am I?

00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,767
This is where it started.

29
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,319
And this is where it has to end.

00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:06,411
- Have you even talked to Bonnie?
- I'm mad at her.

35
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:09,188
{\pos(192,230)}- She needs to make the first move.
- Be the bigger person.

36
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,206
{\pos(192,230)}Impossible in her presence.

37
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,295
{\pos(192,230)}Why are you so pissed
at her, anyway?

38
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,166
{\pos(192,230)}She's a thief. That's why.

39
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,135
{\pos(192,230)}I gave her my necklace,
and she refuses to give it back.

40
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,658
{\pos(192,230)}It's a matter of principle.

41
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,308
{\pos(192,230)}All right. Well, I tried.
I'm officially out of it.

42
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,733
{\pos(192,230)}Good. Your turn.

43
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:27,149

Have you talked to him?

{\pos(192,230)}- He's avoiding me.
- Why?

45

It's complicated.

46
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:33,254
I'll see you later.

00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:53,399
{\pos(192,220)}Good morning, everyone.

48
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,279
{\pos(192,230)}Alrighty.

49
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,078
<i>Are you alright?</i>

50
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:19,091
{\pos(192,220)}It's a mouthful. I know.

51
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,970
{\pos(192,220)}Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.
Saltzman is of German origins.

52
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:27,266
{\pos(192,220)}My family emigrated here
in 1755 to Texas.

53
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,084
{\pos(150,220)}I, however, was born
and raised in Boston.

54
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,113
{\pos(192,220)}Now, the name Alaric

55
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:36,817
{\pos(140,220)}belongs to a very dead great-grandfather
I will never be able to thank enough.

56
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,144
{\pos(192,220)}You'll probably want to
pronounce it "Alaric," but it's...

57
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:41,875
"Alaric," okay?

58
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,626
{\pos(150,220)}So you can call me Rick.

What are you doin'?

63
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:55,191
Peace offering.

64
00:04:57,303 --> 00:05:00,591
Come on. You need it for blood
circulation. Does dead flesh good?

65
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:05,763
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Step aside, please.

66
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:11,242
I got the town off our back. It was
for the greater good but I'm sorry.

67
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,919
And to prove it,
I'm not gonna feed on a human

68
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:16,394
for at least a...

69
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,650
week.

70
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,861
I'll adopt the Stefan diet,
only nothing with feathers.

71
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,233
Cause I realize that killing your

72
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:26,210
closest and oldest friend
is beyond evil, and yet

73
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,827
somehow, it's worthy of humor.

74
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:32,386
- Are you mimicking me?
- Yes, Stefan.

75
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:36,089
Now that the secret society
of vampire haters is off our back,

76
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:40,218
I can go back to my routine of how
can I destroy Stefan's life this week.

77
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:44,134
And I can go back to sulking
and Elena-longing

78
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,512
and forehead brooding.
This is fun. I like this.

79
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,583
And I will finally reveal
the ulterior motive

80
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,267
behind my evil and diabolical
return to Mystic Falls.

81
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:55,813
Yeah. I'm done.

82
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,974
That's just like you, Damon.
Always have to have the last word.

83
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,884
And then I ended up at
the remains of old fell's church

84
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,907
before I woke up back in the woods.

85
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,575
And you always see
your ancestor Emily?

86
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,372
Do you believe in ghosts?

87
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:16,250
Two weeks ago,
I'd say no, but now...

88
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,835
I think I'm being haunted.

89
00:06:19,318 --> 00:06:20,900
I don't get it. Why Emily?

90
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:23,757
Grams said she was a powerful
witch back in the civil war days

91
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,552
and that this medallion was hers,
a witch's talisman.

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,721
And it all started when
you got the necklace?

93
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,268
I think she's using it
to communicate with me.

94
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:33,058
What does Grams say about it?

95
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,436
I can't call her. She's gonna
tell me to embrace it.

96
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,147
I don't want to embrace it.
I want it to stop.

97
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:45,818
I'm Jeremy Gilbert.
You wanted to see me?

98
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:51,312
You know that your old teacher

99
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:52,995
had a jackass file?

100
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:56,498
No joke.
It's... typed on a label.

101
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,460
It has all the...
troublemakers in it,

102
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:01,908
but really it's just an opus...

103
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,297
to you.

104
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:09,261
Don't worry about it.

105
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:11,346
I'm not him.

106
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,890
Clean slate.

107
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:14,729
Now...

108
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,299
- Let's talk about grades.
- I know it's been a rough

109
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:22,118
couple of months, but I've been
trying to turn them around.

110
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:26,247
I saw that, but the problem is we're
halfway through a semester and...

111
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,324
half a fail is still pretty bleak.

112
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:33,042
This is the part where you say to me,
"What can I do to change that?"

113
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,617
I'm glad you asked.

114
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:37,456
- How do you feel about extra credit?
- Yeah, totally. Whatever.

115
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,625
Good. Write me a paper then.

116
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:41,794
- Okay. About what?
- History.

117
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,964
Pick a topic. Keep it local.
No <i>Wikipedia regurgita</i>.

118
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,967
These old towns have
a lot of rich history, so just...

119
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,763
get your hands dirty, make it sing,
and you're back on track.

120
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,391
- Deal?
- Yeah. Deal.

121
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,497
That's a cool ring.

122
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,565
Thanks. It was my father's.

123
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,306
Little garish, but family.

124
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:09,207
You know.

125
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,642
You've got a week.

126
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,081
What is that?

127
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,954
- What is what?
- The "Hey."

128
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,479
That's twice.
That is 2 heys. That...

129
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:31,051
Do you have any other words
in your vocabulary?

130
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,014
- What's wrong with "Hey"?
- It reeks of awkward subtext.

131
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,475
You spent the night in my bed,
there was...

132
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,143
cuddling, and then you snuck out before
dawn so you wouldn't have to face me,

133
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:43,812
which I must say is a total lame
guy move that I did not appreciate.

134
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:46,244
And now with the Heys?
Seriously? I mean,

135
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:49,903
I may have been some pathetic,
insecure mess after the party but,

136
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,442
do not mistake that
for me being a pushover,

137
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,275
Because I do not let guys
mess with my head anymore.

138
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,560
I heard your mom in the morning and
I didn't want to get you in trouble

139
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:00,080
so I went out the window.

140
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,677
You went out the window?
Another lame guy move.

141
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:05,214
Your mom's the sheriff.
And as for the heys,

142
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,380
I'm pretty sure it's what I've said
to you every day since the first grade.

143
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,636
Trying to read something into it...

144
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,013
Lame girl move.

145
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,571
You weren't in class.
I was worried.

146
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,439
I got your messages, and sorry
I didn't get back to you, but...

147
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,869
What I wanna say shouldn't
be said over the phone.

148
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,042
A simple "I didn't kill my brother"
text would have sufficed.

149
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,667
I didn't kill my brother,
As much as he

150
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:47,461
deserved it.
He has you to thank for that.

151
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:50,130
So what did you wanna tell me?

152
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:52,799
I won't be coming to school anymore.

153
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,385
I'm gonna back off
and keep my distance.

154
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,012
It's the right thing to do.

155
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,790
Back off from school or...

156
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,768
from me?

157
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,730
Thank you for telling me.

158
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:14,446
- It's better this way.
- Yep. I got it.

159
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:18,346
You're angry.
That's good.

160
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,911
Be easier if you hate me.

161
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,777
Okay, it's your last chance.

162
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,026
I'm gonna scream.

163
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:34,401
Don't do that. Let's stay on point.

164
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:37,034
I want my necklace.

165
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,582
You can't have it.

166
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:41,842
I can't take it but you can give it
to me. I'm trying to help you here.

167
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,121
- I don't want your help.
- You do want my help,

168
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:46,684
and you don't even know it.
You know why, you little witch?

169
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:49,419
Cause you've stumbled into
something you need to stumble out of.

170
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:52,416
- Just leave me alone or I swear...
- Don't. No threats.

171
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,361
A, you hurt me last time.

172
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,645
B, I wish you no harm.

173
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,140
Believe it or not, Bonnie,
I wanna protect you.

174
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:02,327
Let me help you
get Emily off your back.

175
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,956
- How do you know about her?
- I know a lot of things,

176
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,334
and I know more about
that crystal than you do,

177
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,335
and I know that she's using it

178
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,153
to creep inside of you.

179
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,775
See how scared you are?

180
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,459
And you should be,
because I will get that crystal,

181
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:21,054
even if I have to wait for
Emily to give it to me herself.

182
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,978
Next time she comes out to play,
you tell her...

183
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,564
That a deal's a deal.

184
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:39,614
{\PUB}He's bad news, Elena.
He really scared me.

185
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,646
You need to stay as far away
from Damon as possible.

186
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,454
I'm trying. He just
keeps showing up.

187
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:50,625
I don't want you to be alone.
You're sleeping at my place tonight.

188
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,093
We can make a whole night out of it.

189
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,680
Where are you going?

190
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,988
- Are you okay?
- Now I am.

191
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,213
All my problems were
because of that thing.

192
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:24,159
Can't believe
I didn't do that sooner.

193
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,036
What's your Grams gonna say?

194
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,498
Grams isn't the one being haunted
by a 150-year-old ghost, is she?

195
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:32,094
Okay, then.

196
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:38,006
I like a man who can dine alone.

197
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,466
A quiet strength.

198
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,636
I thought you were still in that
whole Logan depression thing.

199
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,429
I've sworn off men forever,

200
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,355
but it doesn't mean I can't
observe them from a safe distance.

201
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,226
Well, I can introduce you.

202
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:02,197
Thanks for coming. I wouldn't
have called if it wasn't important.

203
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,365
I know that.

204
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,215
- He threatened her.
- What would Damon want with Bonnie?

205
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,829
She has this necklace.
Caroline got it from Damon,

206
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,375
and she gave it Bonnie,

207
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,294
and now Damon wants it back.
He's tormenting her.

208
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,668
- Over a necklace.
- It's not just any necklace.

209
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,597
It has to do with Bonnie's heritage.

210
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:25,726
It belonged to one of her ancestors
who lived here during the civil war.

211
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:30,183
When you and Damon lived here.

212
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:32,968
Her name was Emily.

213
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:36,690
She was Katherine's handmaid
and a witch.

214
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:38,781
You know?

215
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:40,756
About Bonnie?

216
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:43,947
The first night that you invited me
over for dinner, I made the connection.

217
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,860
And... now Damon knows, and...

218
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:50,162
for some reason,
he wants that necklace.

219
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,942
- What does it look like?
- It's...

220
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,779
- an antique iron setting with...
- With an amber crystal.

221
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,646
I know it. It belonged to Katherine.

222
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,796
Emily gave it to her,
which means that...

223
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:01,777
What?

224
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,677
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

225
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,545
- Let me talk to Damon.
- Will he tell you?

226
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:14,227
I'll get it out of him.

227
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,491
Have you picked a topic?

228
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:23,906
No, not yet. It's gotta be local
and non-Internet research, so...

229
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,231
That's easy.
You got all your dad's stuff.

230
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:28,267
- What stuff?
- How the Gilberts came over

231
00:14:28,392 --> 00:14:31,578
on the Mayflower stuff, all that
family lineage from way back.

232
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,896
Your dad really loved
all that family history stuff.

233
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:37,316
It's all boxed up in the closet.

234
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,431
What's up, man?

235
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:46,748
This is my aunt Jenna.

236
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:48,995
It's nice to meet you.

237
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,498
Jeremy was just
telling me about his paper.

238
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,934
Thanks for giving him
another chance.

239
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,062
It was my first day. I wanted
to make a good impression.

240
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,716
So, Stefan...

241
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,578
You know, I been thinking.

242
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:07,614
I think we should start over,

243
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,855
give this brother thing
another chance.

244
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,880
We used to do it, oh,
so well once upon a time.

245
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,506
I don't, Damon.

246
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:17,894
I can't trust you to be a nice guy.

247
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,156
You kill everybody,
and you're so mean.

248
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:21,753
You're so mean, and...

249
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,882
You're really hard to imitate, and then
I have to go to that lesser place.

250
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,846
Can I get a coffee, please?

251
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:29,771
So what's with the bottle?

252
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:33,306
I'm on edge. Crash diet, and
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

253
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,437
You could always just leave,
find a new town

254
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:37,686
to turn into your own
personal gas and sip.

255
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:38,937
I'll manage.

256
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:45,789
- You don't have to keep an eye on me.
- I'm not here to keep an eye on you.

257
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:48,029
- So why are you here?
- Why not?

258
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:07,674
I'm sorry.
There. I said it.

259
00:16:08,188 --> 00:16:10,760
If you want the ugly-ass necklace,
Keep it.

260
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,928
It's yours.

261
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:16,600
Will you hate me if
I tell you I threw it away?

262
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:19,644
- You threw it away?
- I know it sounds crazy but

263
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,352
the necklace was giving me
nightmares. I had to get rid of it.

264
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,347
You could have just
given it back to me.

265
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:26,445
Why? So you could
give it back to Damon?

266
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,652
Screw Damon.

267
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,697
Are we doing manicures
or what? Who has their kit?

268
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:32,332
Mine's in my bag.

269
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,439
How long do you think this fight
with Stefan's gonna last? Is it...

270
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,373
like a permanent thing?

271
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,426
I don't know, Caroline.

272
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:46,717
Why are you such
a little liar, Bonnie?

273
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:47,842
What?

274
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,937
{\PUB}I'm not lying to you,
Caroline. I swear.

275
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,273
It's true.
I watched her throw it into a field.

276
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,524
Then explain it.

277
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,928
- Who's Emily?
- The ghost.

278
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,990
{\pos(100,210)}- The ghost has a name now?
- Caroline, please.

279
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,125
{\pos(192,210)}I wonder why
she won't leave me alone.

280
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,245
{\pos(192,210)}What is going on? Why
am I not a part of this conversation?

281
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,956
{\pos(192,210)}- You guys do this to me all the time.
- That's not true.

282
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,174
Yes, it is.

283
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:26,044
I can't talk to you.
You don't listen.

284
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,512
That's not true.

285
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,589
I'm a witch.

286
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,716
- And don't we all know it?
- See?

287
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,926
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm trying to tell you something.

288
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:36,554
You don't even hear it.

289
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:41,726
I listen.
When do I not listen?

290
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,983
Jeremy totally ditched me.

291
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,858
- Where'd he go?
- Home.

292
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,734
It's not far. He can walk it.

293
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,195
So are you from here?
Are you a townie?

294
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,782
I'm a returnee.
Left town for a while. Now I'm back.

295
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,826
- Why'd you leave?
- School.

296
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,540
And then there's the real reason.

297
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,826
I was wronged.

298
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:08,628
Guy named Logan.

299
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,922
- What'd he do?
- Basics...

300
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,633
Lied, cheated,
lured me back in, left me again.

301
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,466
Your turn. Any sad
relationship stories?

302
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,249
The basics...

303
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,551
Fell in love,

304
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,018
married young,

305
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:26,091
my wife died.

306
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:33,903
That's always a good
conversation stopper.

307
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:37,365
- What happened?
- Well, you, me, and the...

308
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,776
North Carolina police department
are all wondering the same thing.

309
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,771
It's what's known as a cold case.

310
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:49,335
- So why'd you move here?
- A change of pace,

311
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,603
new scenery.

312
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,616
I like it here. It's...

313
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,257
Got a rich history.

314
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,228
Lucky shot.

315
00:18:58,353 --> 00:19:01,347
More like a carefully honed
skill over many decades.

316
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:06,644
- You're beating me.
- It's because I'm better than you.

317
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,355
I'm onto you.
Reverse psychology.

318
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,108
It's a little transparent,
but I admire the effort.

319
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:14,686
You prefer the brooding forehead?

320
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,973
Seriously, what game
do you think you're playing?

321
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,946
That's a funny question
considering the fact

322
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:24,078
that I have been asking
you that for months.

323
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,665
- It's frustrating, isn't it?
- Touch.

324
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,196
Look, it's just not me.

325
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,625
I don't believe in the...

326
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,728
But if you do, then...
okay. I'm in.

327
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:52,344
That's all it takes for me
to jump onboard, because

328
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,693
I consider you to be my best friend.

329
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,695
And I'm saying this knowing that

330
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,365
Elena's in the kitchen
listening to my every word.

331
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:07,138
I didn't know
how real this was for you,

332
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:08,987
but I'm listening now.

333
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,343
Elena, you can
come in now. We're done.

334
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:28,214
There is just way too
much drama in this room.

335
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:30,520
So what do you guys wanna do?

336
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:34,107
I have an idea.
Why don't we have a sance?

337
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,193
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Come on.

338
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,903
Let's summon some spirits.

339
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,115
This Emily chick has some
serious explaining to do.

340
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,364
- What are we doing?
- I don't know.

341
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,459
Be quiet and concentrate.

342
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,837
Close your eyes.

343
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:58,923
Now take a deep breath.

344
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,013
Call to her.

345
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:08,997
You there?

346
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,478
Really? "Emily, you there?"
That's all you got?

347
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,517
- Come on.
- Fine. Jeez.

348
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:22,184
I call on you.

349
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:25,353
I know you have a message.

350
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,161
I'm here to listen.

351
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,288
- Did that just...
- Yeah. It just happened.

352
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,725
It's just the air conditioning.

353
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,654
Ask her to show you a sign.

354
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:47,889
Ask her.

355
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:52,018
If you're among us,

356
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,811
show us another sign.

357
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,235
See? It's not working.

358
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:09,002
I can't. I'm done.

359
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:13,668
Get the light. Please get the light.

360
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:15,193
Hold on. I got it.

361
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:18,735
You guys,

362
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,630
the necklace, it's gone.

363
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,008
{\PUB}- What are we doin' here?
- Bonding. Catch.

364
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:42,801
{\pos(192,210)}Go on.

365
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,812
{\pos(192,210)}Give it a try.

366
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,374
{\pos(192,210)}Don't forget who taught
you how to play this game.

367
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,211
That hurt.

368
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,979
Downside of my diet...

369
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:05,618
Getting hit
actually hurts a little bit.

370
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,403
I'm impressed, Stefan.

371
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:13,060
Fun with booze and darts,

372
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:15,523
Sentimental with football, and now

373
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:17,811
starry night.

374
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,952
What do you want, Stefan?

375
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:32,368
It wasn't real, Damon.

376
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:35,884
Our love for Katherine.

377
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,555
She compelled us.
We didn't have a choice.

378
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,335
Took me years to sort that out,

379
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,003
to truly understand
what she did to us.

380
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:47,838
We are not takin' that on tonight.

381
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,100
What do you want
with Katherine's crystal?

382
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,634
How do you know about that?

383
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:04,233
Come on. You knew
Elena would tell me.

384
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,945
How did you know it was Katherine's?

385
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:10,448
Emily gave it to her
on her last night.

386
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,117
I was with her, and you weren't.

387
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,330
I was the last one to see her.

388
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,611
Now, what do you want
with Katherine's crystal?

389
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,552
- She didn't tell you?
- We had other things on our mind.

390
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:38,392
I could rip your heart out
and not think twice about it.

391
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:41,854
I've heard that before.

392
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,009
I have a bigger surprise, Stefan.

393
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,368
I'm gonna bring her back.

394
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:05,837
Fun's over, Caroline.
You made a point, and I get it.

395
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,589
- Now give it back.
- What? Well, I didn't take it.

396
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,702
- What? What happened?
- I don't know. Nothing.

397
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:16,650
Jeremy, are you home?

398
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,350
Guys...

399
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,325
<i>You guys open the door!</i>

400
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,803
- <i>Help me!</i>
- What's going on?

401
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:59,223
Try the other door.
I'll check the hallway.

402
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,062
Unlock the door!

403
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,391
Open the door!

404
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,959
What happened?
Are you okay?

405
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:36,415
I'm fine.

406
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:40,214
Unbelievable.
You were totally faking it.

407
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:42,808
- Come on.
- No, you scared the hell out of me.

408
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:49,338
I'm fine.

409
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,318
Everything's fine.

410
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:03,982
- How can you bring Katherine back?
- Before Katherine and the others

411
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:06,967
were killed in the church, you remember
what it was like in this town?

412
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,149
- I remember the fear and the hysteria.
- Townspeople were killing vampires

413
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:13,009
one by one. When they came for
Katherine, I went straight to Emily,

414
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:16,561
said, "I'll do anything. Name
your price. Just protect her." She did.

415
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:18,207
How?

416
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,287
She did some kind of spell
with the crystal.

417
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:23,383
And while the church was burning,
we thought Katherine was burning in it.

418
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,024
- She wasn't.
- But I saw her go inside.

419
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:27,349
There's a tomb

420
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:32,026
underneath the church. The spell sealed
Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.

421
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,097
Are you telling me
that Katherine's alive?

422
00:27:34,222 --> 00:27:36,453
If that's what you wanna call it.
She's been trapped

423
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:39,212
in a mystical holding cell
for the last century and a half, but

424
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:41,673
you're an expert
on a starving a vampire, so

425
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:43,244
how do you think she's doing?

426
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:47,264
Did you know that witches can use

427
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:49,755
celestial events to draw
energy into their magic?

428
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
Me either.

429
00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:54,560
But in order to give
the crystal its power,

430
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:57,133
Emily used the comet
that was passing overhead,

431
00:27:57,618 --> 00:28:00,468
And in order for that
crystal to work again...

432
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,163
- The comet had to return.
- Downside...

433
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,416
Long time in between comets
and a couple of

434
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:10,363
hiccups along the way with the crystal
but the comet passed,

435
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,613
and I got the crystal.
And then Caroline got the crystal,

436
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:16,381
and now Bonnie has the crystal,
and here we are.

437
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:18,829
Why would Emily...
Why would she do this for you?

438
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:22,054
Because she knew they were
gonna come for her, too,

439
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,971
and she made me promise
that her lineage would survive.

440
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:27,714
I remember.
You saved her children.

441
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,912
It's the only thing
keeping me from ripping

442
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:32,876
that little Bonnie girl's throat out
to get my crystal back.

443
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,670
Well. A deal's a deal.

444
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:36,161
So...

445
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:39,768
You wanna go throw some more?

446
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:43,069
I can't believe I fell for it.

447
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:44,750
- Are you okay?
- I must go.

448
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,391
- She's leaving, I'm leaving.
- You guys can't leave.

449
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,278
I can. I've had enough freaky fake
witch stuff for one night.

450
00:28:50,403 --> 00:28:51,979
Thank you for having me.

451
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,940
- I'll take it from here.
- Where are you going?

452
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,859
Back to where it all began.

453
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:06,202
I won't let him have it.
It must be destroyed.

454
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,710
Wait!

455
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,680
- What's happening?
- I don't know. The door, it's not...

456
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,166
What the hell?

457
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,055
I'm outta here.

458
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,642
- What's wrong?
- <i>It's Bonnie.</i>

459
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,904
- What happened?
- <i>Emily is possessing her.</i>

460
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,039
- She said something.
- What did she say?

461
00:29:44,164 --> 00:29:47,518
<i>She said</i>, "I won't let him have it.
It must be destroyed,"

462
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:50,382
- <i>And then she just left.</i>
- Where do you think she went?

463
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:51,705
<i>I don't know.</i>

464
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:54,646
Fell's church,

465
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:57,920
<i>By the old cemetery that's where
she took Bonnie in her dreams.</i>

466
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,880
We have to help her, Stefan.

467
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,580
Just stay there.
I'm gonna go find her.

468
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:12,164
You look different.

469
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:15,074
- I won't let you do it.
- We had a deal.

470
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:18,236
Things are different now.
I need to protect my family.

471
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:21,110
I protected your family.
You owe me.

472
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,278
I know.

473
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:24,989
I'm sorry.

474
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,253
You're about to be
a lot more than that.

475
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,240
{\PUB}You're so wrong.
I'm much more pathetic.

476
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:52,528
{\pos(192,210)}I've got you beat.
I have pathetic down to a science.

477
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:55,195
{\pos(192,210)}We haven't even covered high school.

478
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,062
{\pos(192,210)}Braces, "A" cup.

479
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,315
{\pos(192,210)}Glasses, skin condition.

480
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,365
You can...

481
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:10,993
You know what?
I'm not gonna invite you in.

482
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,457
Well, some other time then.

483
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,543
Have a good night, Jenna.

484
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:34,362
- So you found the boxes.
- I found this, too.

485
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:37,447
Me and Logan.

486
00:31:39,418 --> 00:31:40,818
That's just cruel.

487
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:42,733
Cruel is dating my history teacher.

488
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,351
I'm not dating him.

489
00:31:44,908 --> 00:31:45,908
Yet.

490
00:32:10,488 --> 00:32:12,179
This is why I feed on people.

491
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:20,161
These people don't deserve this.

492
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:22,886
They should never
have to know such evil.

493
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,813
What do you mean evil?

494
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,294
I swear to God
I'll make you regret this.

495
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,530
I won't let you unleash them
into this world.

496
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:30,698
Them?

497
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:34,515
What part of the story
did you lelee out?

498
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,746
- What does it matter?
- Emily, tell me what you did.

499
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:39,886
To save her,

500
00:32:40,483 --> 00:32:41,709
I had to save them.

501
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,711
You saved everyone in the church?

502
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,130
- With one comes all.
- I don't care about that.

503
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:49,497
- I just want Katherine.
- I knew I shouldn't have believed

504
00:32:49,622 --> 00:32:52,929
a single word that comes out of your
mouth. This isn't about love, is it?

505
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,828
- This is about revenge.
- The two aren't mutually exclusive.

506
00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:57,867
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

507
00:32:57,992 --> 00:32:59,445
They killed 27 people,

508
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,181
and they called it a war battle.
They deserve whatever they get.

509
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:05,250
27 vampires, Damon.
They were vampires.

510
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,425
You can't just bring them back.

511
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:10,230
This town deserves this.

512
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:14,102
You're blaming innocent people for
something that happened 145 years ago.

513
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:17,286
There is nothing innocent about these
people, and don't think for a second

514
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:20,149
it won't happen again. They already
know too much, and they'll burn

515
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:23,084
your little grandwitch right next
to us when they find out. Trust me.

516
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,853
Things are different now.

517
00:33:24,978 --> 00:33:27,378
- Don't do this.
- I can't free them.

518
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,714
I won't.

519
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:31,516
Incendia!

520
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,608
{\PUB}She's alive, but barely.
I can save her.

521
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:43,901
Her neck,

522
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,791
it's healing.

523
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,214
- What are you doing here?
- Your window was open.

524
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:12,192
- I thought you should know
- Not funny.

525
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,212
Earlier today, I lied.

526
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,781
- About?
- About being in bed with you.

527
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,908
We cuddled and it creeped me out.

528
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,526
It creeped you out?

529
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,356
I mean, did you just come over
here to insult me or what?

530
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:27,546
Because it's been
a really long night.

531
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:29,921
It's just that... I don't like you.

532
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:32,215
I never have, but...

533
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:34,214
it was nice.

534
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:36,901
What?

535
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:39,136
Being in bed with you, it felt nice.

536
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:42,909
And so, I was thinking about it,
and I thought that I ould tell you

537
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:44,587
I stayed the night because

538
00:35:44,712 --> 00:35:47,102
you were all sad and alone
and I felt bad for you.

539
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:52,316
Well, thank you,
cause I love being a charity case.

540
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,191
- You can leave now.
- No, because I know...

541
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:58,324
With Vicki gone

542
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,799
and my mom off with...
Pete whoever,

543
00:36:02,824 --> 00:36:03,974
it's just me,

544
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:06,228
so...

545
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:07,816
I know.

546
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:31,385
Katherine never compelled me.
I knew everything

547
00:36:32,073 --> 00:36:33,673
every step of the way.

548
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:42,292
It was real for me.

549
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:50,366
I'll leave now.

550
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:57,444
I don't understand, Elena,
what happened to me.

551
00:36:57,569 --> 00:36:59,169
He attacked me, and...

552
00:36:59,294 --> 00:37:00,794
his face was like...

553
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:03,158
How do you feel?
Are you okay?

554
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,888
I'm fine.

555
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:07,206
It's just this blood. I don't...

556
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:13,712
I'm not gonna hurt you.

557
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:17,971
- What's going on?
- I'll explain everything.

558
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:20,028
Okay? Let's just get out of here.

559
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,085
Look at me. Trust me.

560
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,078
He's not going to hurt you.

561
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,646
Come on.
Come on.

562
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:45,055
Is she in danger of becoming...

563
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:48,223
No, she has to die with
my blood in her system,

564
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:51,822
so keep an eye on her tonight and
make sure that nothing happens and

565
00:37:51,947 --> 00:37:54,178
once it leaves her system,
she'll be fine.

566
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:57,153
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

567
00:38:00,014 --> 00:38:01,014
You sure?

568
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:04,239
I can trust her.

569
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:06,074
I need someone to know,

570
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,452
someone to talk to.
I can't live in secret.

571
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:09,882
I know that.

572
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:11,992
Shouldn't have to.

573
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:16,672
You saved her life.

574
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,616
I'm sorry, Stefan.
I thought that...

575
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,250
I couldn't be with you, but I can.

576
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,771
You don't have to push me away.

577
00:38:30,522 --> 00:38:31,722
I can do this.

578
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:38,987
I can't.

579
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:45,312
I have to leave.

580
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:49,678
Too many people have died.
Too much has happened.

581
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:50,938
What?

582
00:38:51,393 --> 00:38:53,249
No. I know you think

583
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:56,022
- you're protecting me, but...
- I have to.

584
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:57,921
Coming home was...

585
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:00,754
It was a mistake.

586
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:04,021
I can't be a part of
your life anymore.

587
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,051
Don't go, Stefan.

588
00:39:07,485 --> 00:39:08,485
Please...

589
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,247
You don't have to.
This is your home.

590
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:12,766
Please don't go.

591
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,785
Good-Bye, Elena.

592
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,529
You're just gonna walk away?

593
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:28,251
Don't walk away, Stefan!

594
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,340
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

missing from my tv.

about this yet.

Of course. kids are

So, what do you need?

00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:29,801
There's been
another attack--

106
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,801
A female victim,
her throat torn out,

107

Completely drained

I-i'm sorry.
i don't understand.

I thought we solved
that problem when i...

111

Staked the blonde one.

112
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,234

have turned someone

113
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:45,134
Or multiple someones.
i don't know.

114

the town is another
animal attack,

how long we can keep
lying to them.

we were past this.

So, uh, what do we do?

119
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,634
You're the only one
who's ever taken on
a vampire.

and the krumper did the salsa.

00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,268
Well, i don't know
when you fell asleep.

124
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:17,433
Um, did you see
the celine dion waltz
about cancer?

125
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,134
Those always
make me cry.

126
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:23,168
Yeah. and then the loud
judge kept screamin',
and i couldn't take it,

127
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,834
So i turned it off.

128
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:26,834
I sat through
"family guy,"

Kind of weird,
don't you think?

133
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,534
She needs
someone nice like him,

134
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:38,001
As opposed
to a homicidal vampire
like damon.

135
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,734
Yeah. how are you
doing with all that?

136
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,767
I'm freaked out.

137
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:45,700
Damon attacked me.
i could be dead right now.

138
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,134
But i'm also grateful.

Have you seen him?

143

Not since he told me
was leaving.

144
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,201
for all i know,
he's already gone.

145
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:01,500
He wouldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

146
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,634
Yes, he would.

147
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:04,300
He thinks
he's protecting me.

and all that.

149
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,534

gonna do?

What am i
supposed to do?

151
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,101
I already begged him
not to go.

152
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,101
If i ask again,
i'm being selfish.

154
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,134

for the best.

could you have had with him,

Even if he stayed?

158
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:25,667
Did you just--

159
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:26,700
No, i swear.

160
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,168

for stopping by.

161
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,300
Let me know
what you come up with.

162
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Absolutely.

163
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,034

you killed somebody?

164
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:41,867
Get off of me.

i wouldn't havbeen

who it could be?

None.

197
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:15,901
But it must be
somebody new,

198
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,801
Because leaving
a body like that,

199
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:18,834
They're
either sloppy,

200
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,134
Or they're trying
to send a message.

201
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:22,201
And u're sure
it's not damon.

202

Well, i'm never
sure about damon,

203
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,634
But he's been
trying to keep
a low profile lately,

204

So it just doesn't
make any sense to me.

gonna do?

Damon's tracking them
right now.

the truth,

I want you
to be careful.

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,801
Jonathan gilbert
from the 1800s.

219
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,667
He's kind of
a freak show.
he wrote about demons

220
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,734
And all these people
getting slaughtered
and--

221
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:19,101
Yeah, he was a writer--
short stories, horror stuff.

222
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:20,534
Oh, he wrote fiction?

223
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:23,534
Figured he was just
a lunatic or a drunk.

224
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,367
Well, he was a gilbert,

225
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:28,834
Probably
a little bit of both.

226
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,268
So what do i do now?

227
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,767
Damon: just wait.
i'll be there in a minute.

228
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,967
Can you hurry?
i have things to do.

229
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,001
You could
give me that.

230
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,767
So why did you
need me to do this?

231
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:48,367
Because i interfere
with the signal.

232
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:49,700
Can i go now?

233
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,534
This has blown,
like, half of my day.

234
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:55,234
You do that.

235
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,700
Get in your car.
go home.

236
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,067
Forget i asked you
to do this.

237
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,834
Ok. bye now.

238
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:02,834
Bye.

239
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,201
[gunfire]

240
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:37,767
[groaning]

241
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:47,800
I have tons
of these wooden bullets,

242
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,634
So nothin' funky.

243
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,933
You don't wanna do this.
trust me.

244
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,634
Aah! ow!

245
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:54,768
That's what you get.

246
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:55,867
For what?

247
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,900
You made me like this.

248
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,934
I killed you.
i didn't turn you.

249
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:02,400
See, i know what you
and your brother are.

250
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,268
I've been watchin'
the two of you.

251
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,300
I knew
you'd show up here,

252
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,901
And i'm glad you did,
'cause i have
some questions.

253
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,734
Me first.
who turned you?

254
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,600
How should i know?

255
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,101
Last thing
i remember is i'm about
to stake your brother,

256
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,234
And then you grabbed me.
that's it.

257
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:20,967
Until i wake up
in the ground

258
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:23,834
Behind a used-car
dealership on highway 4.

259
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,734
Somebody buried me.

260
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:29,400
It happens. ow.

261
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,433
You bit me.

262
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:31,400
Damn it.

263
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,101
It had to be you.

264
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:36,367
You have to have vampire blood
in your system when you die.

265
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,801
I didn't do that.

266
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,300
Some other vampire
found you,

267
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,500
Gave you their blood.

268
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,600
[groans]

269
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,667
Who?

270
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,934
That's what i wanna know.

271
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,700
Dude, it's not like
the welcome wagon

272
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,001
Was waiting
with a bundt cake
and a handbook.

273
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,700
It's been
a learn-as-you-go
process.

274
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,801
You know, one minute,

275
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:55,201
I'm a small-town
on-the-rise news guy,

276
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,634
And next thing
i know, i can't get
into my house,

277
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:00,001
Because my foowowon'
go through the door.

278
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:01,300
You have to be
invited in.

279
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,067
I know. i live alone.

280
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,134
Ah. heh heh.
that sucks.

281
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,867
So now i'm
at the ramada watchin'
pay-per-view all day,

282
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:08,967
Eating everything
in sight,

283
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,567
Including housekeeping.

284
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:11,801
It could be worse.

285
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:14,934
All i can
think about is blood
and killing people.

286
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:16,534
I can't stop
killing people.

287
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,134
I keep killing.
heh heh.

288
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:20,168
And i like it.

289
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:21,634
I'm conflicted.

290
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,034
Welcome to the club.

291
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:25,567
Wait a minute.

292
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,567
Cops only found
one body.

293
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,367
I left one. i was tired.

294
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:32,067
But i've been hidin'
the st o othe bodies.

295
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,400
They're
right back there.

296
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,534
You're kidding.

297
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:35,867
They're just pilin' up.

298
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,667
[music playing]

299
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,134
[no audible dialogue]

300
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:50,001
So what do we know?

301
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,934
Nothing new
to report yet.

302
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,901
My highly
reliable deputies
are all on alert,

303
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,934
But if you feel the need
to be more proactive,

304
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:02,001
By all means,
grab a stake
and have at it.

305
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:03,700
What extra precautions
can we take?

306
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,367
For right now, there's
nowhere safer than
a crowded public place,

307
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,067
And for once, mayor,
we actually know
where our kids are.

308
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,201
What do you want?

309
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:24,201
Hey. uh, just surprised
to see you here.

310
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,634
Art usually implies culture,

311
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:27,867
And culture implies,
well, not you.

312
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,500
Go to hell.

313
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,101
Still wanna be
an astronaut?

314
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:47,433
I can't believe
you remember that.

315
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:49,801
I can remember
the tinfoil that
you wore on your head.

316
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:50,801
I was 8.

317
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,101
How are you doing?

318
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,901
I've had it easier.

319
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,634
You?

320
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:06,234
Uh, i heard some things.

321
00:15:07,268 --> 00:15:09,934
So it's true
that you and stefan...

322
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:12,268
Yeah, it is.

323
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:13,967
What about you...

324
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:15,901
Matt donovan?

325
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,067
I heard about caroline.

326
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:20,834
Aw, man, not you, too.

327
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:21,867
Hey.

328
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,067
We're friends.

329
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:25,333
It's not a big deal.

330
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,500
No?

331
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,400
No.

332
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:42,234
Why am i
so overly emotional?

333
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,134
All i can think about
is my ex-girlfriend.

334
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:47,734
I wanna be with her
and bite her and stuff.

335
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:49,867
Well, you probably
love her.

336
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:53,300
Anything you felt before
will be magnified now.

337
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,834
You're gonna have to learn
how to control that.

338
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:57,634
What about
walkin' in the sun?

339
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:58,867
I'm a morning person.

340
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:01,667
You can walk in the sun,
which, by the way,

341
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,234
Is pretty cool.

342
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,168
Council'd never
suspect you.

343
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,001
It's not
in the journals.

344
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,367
The journals?

345
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,767
Yeah,
the founding fathers,

346
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,268
They passed down
journals to their kids.

347
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:13,801
Come on, man.
you gotta tell me.

348
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,300
How can you walk around
in the sun?

349
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,201
Who turned you?

350
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:19,234
How do you walk
in the sun?

351
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,400
Who turned you?

352
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,067
You know, i've been
really nice so far,

353
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,734
But i will kill you.

354
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,867
Then you'll never know.

355
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:31,567
You're not answering
my question.

356
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:32,934
You first.

357
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,400
Seems we're at a bit
of an impasse then, doesn't it?

358
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,700
I have things to do,
people to kill.

359
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,600
Guess i'll be needing
a little head start.

360
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,067
Aaaah!

361
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,067
Ow.

362
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,934
Ahh. damn it.

363
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm guessing you're not here
to plan the path
for your future.

364
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,901
You're looking out
for me.

365
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:59,333
Hope that's ok.

366
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,734
You know, i wanted
to be a doctor

367
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:20,534
Before everything
happened, but, uh,

368
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,034
Then i couldn't,
cause...

369
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:24,067
The blood.

370
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,400
Yeah.

371
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,667
I've dabbled in a bunch of different
things, though.

372
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,333
Didn't love anything
enough to stick to it?

373
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,367
No, i--i loved it all.

374
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:38,168
I just--i had to
move on before

375
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:42,834
Anybody could notice
that i wasn't getting
any older.

376
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
How long before
th would happen?

377
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,534
Few years, usually.

378
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,667
Sometimes shorter.

379
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,867
And you always left.

380
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:54,500
I didn't have a choice.

381
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,801
So what about--
what about you?

382
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:04,700
What are your, uh,
plans for the future?

383
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,101
I don't wanna talk
about my future, stefan,

384
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:09,834
Because everything
you're saying is making it
perfectly clear

385
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,934
That you're
not gonna be in it.

386
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,433
Elena, it's not that
i don't wanna  in it.

387
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:16,600
You can' i get it.

388
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,567
I heard you the first me
and the second time,

389
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,901
And i appreciate you
looking out for me,

390
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,500
But, please, if you're
gonna leave, then just go.

391
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:29,934
Hide me.

392
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,300
What's going on?

393
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,300
The scum fell
has landed.

394
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,934
Logan's here.

395
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:36,967
Wait. logan fell?

396
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:00,867
Stefan, what's going on?

397
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:04,067
Jenna, are you
dodging me?

398
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:05,567
It's a form of
self-preservation.

399
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:08,433
Um, elena, why don't
you and jenna go
somewhere else.

400
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,300
Let's go.

401
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,467
What are you
doin' here?

402
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,434
You know, your brother
asked me the same thing.

403
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:25,700
In fact, why don't we just skip past 
all that who-turned-me stuff

404
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,034
And get the answer
that i want?

405
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,401
How can i turn into
a daywalker?

406
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:32,833
Damon and i are the only 2
that i know of.

407
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,900
But you're both very cagey
on the how,

408
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Which tells me
that there is a way.

409
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:41,067
You know, in case
you hadn't noticed

410
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,401
I'm quite the celebrity
in this town.

411
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:47,733
It would be very, very easy
for me to expose you.

412
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:53,833
You wanna know how you can 
walk around in the sun?

413
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,034
I do.

414
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,434
You can't.

415
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:04,900
Don't ever
threaten me again.

416
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:14,967
When logan came to the house,
what did he say?

417
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:17,467
[groans] fake flattery.
stupid, dimpled grin.

418
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,833
Puppy dog eyes.

419
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,833
I'm serious, jenna.

420
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,167
How did he act?
what did he say?

421
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,167
He was the usual logan,
was charming,

422
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,301
Little more manic
than usual.

423
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:28,201
He kept trying to convince me
to let him in.

424
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,167
Ok, listen to me
very carefully.

425
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,733
Do not,
under any circumstances,

426
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:39,767
Talk to him again.
i'm serious, jenna, like, ever.

427
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,401
Hey. elena.

428
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:44,401
Jenna.

429
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:45,501
Hi, mr. saltzman.

430
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:47,800
Yeah, i was hopin'
to, uh, see you tonight.

431
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Career night
is the new bowling.

432
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Ah. heh heh.

433
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,867
Ok. um, excuse me.

434
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:54,534
Damon:
logan fell's
a vampire,

435
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:57,700
And when i find him
again, i am gonna
destroy him

436
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,134
Limb by limb.

437
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,401
What happened? you ok?

438
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,534
No. i'm not ok.

439
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:04,967
i was ambushed.

440
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,601
I was shot.

441
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,401
Now i'm vengeful.
just gotta find him.

442
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:13,401
Well, there's no need.
he's here at the school.

443
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:14,401
You're kidding me.

444
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,367
Why the hell
is he there?

445
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:17,934
He's workin' the crowd.

446
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:20,234
Well, i'll be
right there.

447
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:26,067
So anything
you'd like to share?

448
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,367
What are you doin'?

449
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:29,301
Following my future.

450
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:32,401
Broadcast
journalism?

451
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:33,568
Yes.

452
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,000
Broadcast journalism.

453
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,967
Why are you looking
at me like that?

454
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,767
You don't even
read the paper.

455
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:48,733
Liz.

456
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:51,934
Logan.

457
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:54,267
What are you gonna do,
stake me?

458
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:56,800
Bury me in another
shallow grave?

459
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,934
What would the e-mail
say this time?

460
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,601
I didn't have a choice.

461
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:02,367
You bitch.

462
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:06,134
I died for you,
for this town.

463
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:09,401
You've known me
since i was 6,

464
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:12,668
And you swept me
under the rug like dirt.

465
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,401
You knew what you
were getting into.

466
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:15,833
I was one of you.

467
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,201
And now you're
one of them.

468
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,134
Watch your back,
sheriff.

469
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,301
Get a backup team
to the school
immediately.

470
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:36,867
Keep it within
the circle. it's a v5.

471
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:38,434
I didn't know you drew.

472
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:39,634
It's an elective.

473
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,767
'cause it's good stuff.
you like graphics?

474
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:44,301
'cause that's, uh--
that's kind of my thing.

475
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:46,134
Whoa. whoa.
what are you doin'?

476
00:22:46,134 --> 00:22:48,301
Well, it's just
something else
we have in common.

477
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,967
And what's
the other thing? vicki?

478
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,100
Let's hang out because
we did the same chick?

479
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,733
Go be friends with
one of the many other
guys that she screwed.

480
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:56,767
There's
no shortage of 'em.

481
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:01,301
Whoa. whoa.
hey, hey, hey.

482
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,833
Hey, hey. hey.

483
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,501
All right, work it out,
tough guy.

484
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:07,034
You two,
follow me.

485
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,301
Excuse me, mayor.

486
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:13,867
Where are you
takin' 'em?

487
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:15,167
I'm gonna talk to 'em.

488
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:17,167
All fights should end
in handshakes, don't you think?

489
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,467
Bonnie, where are you?
i'm ready to go.

490
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,267
I'll be outside.

491
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,401
Hey, damsel in distress.

492
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:27,568
Need a ride?

493
00:23:27,568 --> 00:23:30,568
Oh, my god.
logan fell, channel 9,
is that you?

494
00:23:30,568 --> 00:23:33,534
I used to baby-sit you,
caroline forbes. don't mock me.

495
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:36,267
Well, i was supposed
to go home with bonnie,

496
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:37,800
But i can't find her.

497
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,668
It's not a problem, really.

498
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:42,301
it's on my way.

499
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:43,301
Ok.

500
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,067
You know,
this is fate.

501
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,100
And why is that?

502
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
'cause i'm interested
in broadcast journalism.

503
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,367
So can i ask you
a couple questions?

504
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:04,367
Anything you want.

505
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:06,733
First, buckle up.

506
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:18,467
Matt: hey.

507
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:20,501
Hey, have you seen logan fell,
the news guy?

508
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,467
Yeah. he just
gave caroline
a ride home.

509
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:26,167
Stay here.

510
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:35,567
Ok.

511
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:38,467
Let's get this
out of your system.

512
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,867
Go ahead. fight.

513
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,434
You want us to what?

514
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:44,267
I'm not gonna
fight him, dad.

515
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,300
I don't think so, sir.

516
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,467
You don't fight
in there like pansies.

517
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:56,034
You take it outside, fight your battles
like men, and move on.

518
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:59,233
Best lesson
my dad taught me.

519
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,701
So let's settle it.

520
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:02,701
Fight.

521
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,901
Come on, dad.

522
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,601
It's not gonna happen.

523
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:08,068
I said fight!

524
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:09,367
Whoa. what's
goin' on out here?

525
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:11,934
Just lettin'
these 2 kids work it out.

526
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,901
We're good here.
go back inside.

527
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:16,567
I don't wanna go
back inside.

528
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,467
What i want
is an answer
to my question.

529
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,801
What's goin' on
out here?

530
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:24,300
Who do you think
you're talkin' to?

531
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,333
Do i look like
a student?

532
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,534
No, you look like
a full-grown

533
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:30,834
Alpha-male
douche bag.

534
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:34,600
You don't talk
to me like that.

535
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,967
I can have your job
like this.

536
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,934
Ahyou do that.

537
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,400
Then it'll be
you and me

538
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,101
In this parking lot
working things out.

539
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:46,700
You cool with that?

540
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:49,534
You just
marked yourself.

541
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:50,867
Ok.

542
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:04,333
You all right?

543
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:08,367
[cellphone rings]

544
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,267
Where are you?

545
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:14,234
Your daughter has
expressed an interest
in journalism.

546
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:17,033
I think it's important
to foster young minds.

547
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,000
What do you want?

548
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The satisfaction
of turning your daughter
into a vampire.

549
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:34,900
Payback's a bitch,
isn't it?

550
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:38,834
Get her out of here.

551
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:41,601
Liz: logan,
what happened?! logan!

552
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,033
Sheriff.
i-it's damon.

553
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:45,100
Where's caroline?

554
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,701
She's ok.
i-i'm on elm street.

555
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:51,501
[groaning]

556
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,467
Gonna try this
one more time.

557
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:04,534
Who turned you?

558
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:05,933
I told you
i don't know.

559
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,334
This tire iron here
could take your head
clean off.

560
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:12,501
Is that
your final answer?

561
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:13,967
How can you side
with them?

562
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:14,933
I don't side
with anyone.

563
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,401
You pissed me off.
I want you dead.

564
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:19,601
Who turned you?
i don't know!

565
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:21,067
oh, well.
you're screwed.

566
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:23,367
Wait, wait! i do know.
you're lying.

567
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:25,434
You think
you're the only one
that wants to get

568
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:28,167
In that tomb underneath
the old church?

569
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,134

Let me get you out of there.

44
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:17,942
I want you to put your hands
on the roof. Just like that.

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,345
You ready?

46
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:23,081

I got you.

00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:29,320
Are you ok?

49
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:33,057
Can you stand? Anything broken?

50
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:34,325
Uh-uh.

51
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,401
Whoa, you're fading fast, elena.
Elena, look at me.

52
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:48,205
Focus. Look at me.

53
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:49,973
Ok.

54
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,543
I look like her.

55
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,811
What?

56
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:06,623

59
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,944
After years of reseah and study,
there it was right in front of me.

60
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,079
I was terrified.

61
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:33,384
As I stared it in the eyes,
I drove a stake through its heart.

62
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,121
I was right about mystic falls.

63
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:38,355
There is evil here.

64
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:41,625
I can sense it. Feel it.

Mmm. It's not even 7:00 yet.

68
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:03,046
Which means you shouldn't be
awake for at least 6 hours.

69
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:04,681
I hate morning people.

00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,918

00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,596
Georgia.

00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:56,333
No, no. No, we're not.

But my car. There was a man.

00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:12,115
I hit a man.

85
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:14,351
But then he got up and--who was that?

86
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:16,920
That's what I would like to know.

87
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:18,622

Why are you doing this?

98
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:54,424
I can't be in georgia. I wrecked my car.

00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:56,059
I have to go home.

100
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:57,727
This is kidnapping.

101
00:05:57,795 --> 00:06:00,463
That's a little melodramatic,
don'you think?

102
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:01,698
You're not funny.

103
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,466
You can't do this.

104
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:04,935
I'm not going to georgia.

Why do you have her phone? Is she ok?

And, yes, she's fine.

Yeah. I don't--

121
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:48,979
I don't think she wants
to talk to you right now.

122
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,448
Damon, I swear to god,
if you touch her--

123
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:54,551
You have a good day. Mm-hmm. Bye-now.

Look. No one knows where I am.
Can we please just go back?

00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:13,403
We're almost there.

127
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:14,504
Where is there?!

128
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:16,006
A little place right outside of atlanta.

129
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:17,474
Oh, come on, elena.

130
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,676
You don't wanna go
back right now. Do you?

131
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:23,413
What's the rush? Time-out.

132
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:27,784
Trust me. Your problems are still
going to be there when you get home.

133
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:30,653
Look. Step away from
your life for 5 minutes.

134
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:33,390

135
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:39,629
Am I going to be safe with you?

136
00:07:39,697 --> 00:07:40,797
Yes.

137
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:42,465
Will you promise not to do

138
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,101
That mind control thing with me?

139
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,503
Yes.

140
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,638
Can I trust you?

141
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:51,941
Get in the car. Come on.

Hey, jeremy.

144
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:04,621
I, uh--can't find my ring.
I took it off for the gym

145
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,592
And thought I put it-- there it is.

146
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:14,565
Losing family heirlooms-- bad.

147
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:17,468

You pick a topic yet?

What's the angle?

150
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:21,905
My family-- I found a journal

151
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,308
Of an anstor who lived in the 1800s.

152
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:28,645
And the gilberts were one of t original
founding families of mystic falls. So...

153
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:31,548
That sounds good.

154
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:32,783

156
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,520
I haven't seen you lately.

157
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:39,423
How are you doing with everything?

158
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:41,725
I'm fine. It's all fine.

159
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:43,227
Good. Yeah

160
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:45,696
Are you back in school?

161
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:48,766
No. Actually I came here to find you.

162
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,436
I s hoping you could help
me with something. A spell.

163
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:57,708
Stefan, look, I know elena's
ok with all of this,

164
00:08:57,776 --> 00:08:59,410
And I appreciate what
you did to help me.

165
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:02,112
But I'm not really ready to
dive into it with you just yet.

166
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,248
I understand. But I need your he.

167
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:08,585
It's elena. She's with damon.

168
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,190
I have elena's necklace.
I was just hoping you could e this

169
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:14,725
To make some sort of a connection.

170
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:16,460
I just neeto know that she's ok.

171
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:17,661
How do you know I can do this?

172
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,630
Because I've known a few
witches over the years.

173
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:20,831
I've seen what they can do.

174
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,166
I'm still new at it.

175
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,234
It's ok.

176
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,869
Give it a shot.

177
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:28,138
Ok.

178
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:29,606
All right.

179
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:42,386
There's nothing.

180
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:46,990
Nothing's happening.
Usually there's an image or...

181
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:48,325
Tell me if anyone's looking.

182
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:49,760
Ok.

183
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:51,562
All right.

184
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:12,549
What is it?

185
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:14,351
Something's wrong. With elena?

186
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,920
With me. There's
something wrong with me.

187
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:19,523
I have to go. I'm sorry, stefan.

188
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,592
I can't hp you.

189
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:28,966
So, where's my car?

190
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:30,167
I pulled it off on the side of the road.

191
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,135
I don't think anyone will bother it.

192
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:34,738
At about that man in the road?

193
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,274
Was he a...?

194
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:39,877
From what I could tell. Yeah.

195
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:41,645
You don't kn him?

196
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:43,714
If I've never met him,
I wouldn't know him.

197
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:48,852
I mean, it's not like we all hang out
together at the vamp bar and grill.

198
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,494
You brought me to a bar?

199
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:59,863
Damon, I'm not old enough.
They're not going to let me in.

200
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,598
Sure they will.

00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:36,372
Here's to the man that broke my heart,

208
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,107
Crushed my soul,

209
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:39,676
Destroyed my life,

210
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:42,578
And ruined any and all
chances of happiness!

211
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:45,515
Drink up!

212
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:50,853
Ahh. Whoo!

213
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:55,058
So, how'd he rope you in?

214
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,193
I'm not roped in.
Actually, I'm dating his--

215
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:59,562
Honey, if you're not roped,
you're whipped.

216
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,698
Either way, just eoy the ride.

217
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:03,032
Ok.

218
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,068
So, how did you two meet?

219
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:06,669
College.

220
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:08,571
You went to college?

221
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,040
I've been on a college campus, yes.

222
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:14,177
About 20 years ago, when I was
just a sweet, young freshman.

223
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:17,780
I met this butiful man,
and fell in love.

224
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:19,782
And then he told me
about his littleecret,

225
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,551
Made me love himore.

226
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,386
Because, you see,
I had a little secret of my own

227
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:25,855
That I was dying to share with somebody.

228
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:27,890
She's a witch.

229
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,792
Changed my world.

230
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,828
I rocked your world.

231
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:34,030
He is good in the sack, isn't he?

232
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:38,568
But mostly he's just a walkawayoe.

233
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:46,743
So, what is it that you want?

234
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,710
Oh my god. I am so sorry.

235
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:23,079
There was this one book
wedged between the other.

236
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:26,249
And I pulled and then kaplunk, kaboom.

237
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:27,350
Are you ok?

238
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:30,053
Yeah, I'm fine.

239
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:35,792
Ohh!

240
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:40,096
I'm anna.

241
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:41,531
I'm jeremy.

242
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,381
Thank god you're back.

243
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:02,285
And hello to you, too.
What's the matter?

244
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:06,189
Powers are gone, grams.
I can't do anything,

245
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:07,490
Even when I concentrate.

246
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:09,525
And there's nothing in
in any of these books

247
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:11,027
That can tell me how to get them back.

248
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:13,896
Hang on, now. Just calm down.

249
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:15,364
Tell me what happened.

250
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:17,633
I can't.

251
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:19,869
We keeping secrets now?

252
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:24,207
I have to. I'm sorry. I promised.

253
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:27,043
Please help me.

254
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,015
Well, first of all, there's nothing
in any of these that's gonna help you.

255
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,351
If you're blocked, it's in here.

256
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:38,988
You gotta clear it out,
then you're back in business.

257
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:40,790
Clear what out?

258
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:43,826
Whatever's got you so scared.

259
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:49,298
Hi, jenna. I'm so sorry.

260
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:52,235
Where are you? Why didn't you call?

261
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:54,704
I was so tired last night.
I fell asleep at bonnie's.

262
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,974
And then this morning,
I just wanted to get to school.

263
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,476
Are you ok?

264
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:03,980
You know, stefan and stuff.

265
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,619
Come on, there's gotta b another way.

266
00:15:09,686 --> 00:15:12,221
After all these years,
it's still only katherine.

267
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:13,923
How do you even know she's still alive?

268
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:17,827
Well, you help me get into
that tomb and we'll find out.

269
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:22,565
I already did. 20 years ago. Remember?

270
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,866
3 easy steps--

271
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:25,935
Comet. Crystal. Spell.

272
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:27,370
There's a little problem with number 2.

273
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:29,372
I don't have the crystal.

274
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:33,676
That's it, damon. There is no other way.
It's emily's spell.

275
00:15:33,744 --> 00:15:36,245
What about a new spell

276
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:39,448
With a new crystal that
overrides emily's spell?

277
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:41,551
It doesn't work that way, baby.

278
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:45,988
Emily's spell is absolute.
You can't get into that tomb.

287
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:15,478
You lied.

288
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:17,246
Not until I explain, please.

289
00:17:17,314 --> 00:17:19,048
So, you didn't lie?

290
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:21,384
Just tell me where you are.
So that I can comeet you.

291
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:24,387
How am I connected to katherine, stefan?

292
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:26,489
I honestly don't know.

293
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,257
And I'm supposed to believe that?

294
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:30,393
It's the truth. I--

295
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,728

00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:52,697
Hi.

310
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,132
Can I help you?

311
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,702
I'm stefan. I'm a friend of bonnie's.

312
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,140
Her dad told me that she might be here.

313
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,077
She was. Not anymore.

314
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,211
Do you know where she went?

315
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,712
No. But you do.

316
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,181
I'm sorry?

317
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,950
I told her to face down her fear.

318
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:16,822
And I'm sensing now that you
know exactly why she was scared.

319
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,523
You know what I am.

320
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,059
And yet you offered me your hand,

321
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,663
Which means you wanted me
to see that I can trust you.

322
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,998
Can you?

323
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,268
I ust you'll keep her safe.

324
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,571
You'd better be on your way, then.

325
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,172
I'm not going to invite you in.

326
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,008
I'm sure you understand why.

327
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,782
This aisle is local and state history.

328
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,651
And civil war is one over.

329
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,752
What do you need?

330
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,754
Local. 1860s. Do you work here?

331
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,425
Nope. You want reference. This way.

332
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:57,462
Uh, home-schooled. I study here
for a moc school environment.

333
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,030
Ah, here we go.

334
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:03,201
Original settlers, town archives,
founders stuff. It's all here.

335
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,936
So, what's your topi

336
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:08,607
The town's fear and
hysteria surrounding the war

337
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,976
And how it influenced
certain writers of the time.

338
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,644
You might want to focus that.

339
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,447
The origin of local folklore and myths.

340
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:18,383
You mean the vampires?

341
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,188
Let's just say that I'm
descended from katherine--

342
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,557
Does that make me part vampire?

343
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,293
Vampires can't procreate.

344
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,428
But we love to try.

345
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,230
No.

346
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,700
If you are related,
it would mean katherine had a child

347
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:36,935
Before she was turned.

348
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,772
Did stefan think that he
could use me to replace her?

349
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,741
Kinda creepy if you ask me.

350
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,043
Come on, what? You don't like pickl?

351
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,511
What's wrong with you?

352
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,646
How can you even eat?

353
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,315
If technically you're supposed to be--

354
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,617
Dead.

355
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,586
It's not such a bad word.

356
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:58,690
As long as I keep a healthy
diet of blood in my system,

357
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:03,728
Our dy functions pretty normally.

358
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,933
This nice act. Is any of it real?

359
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,937
Bree: Here you go, honey.

360
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,705
Thank you.

361
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,941
I'll have one too.

362
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,409
Hmm?

363
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,679
Time out, remember? For 5 minutes?

364
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,981
Yeah, well that 5 minutes
is going to need a beer.

365
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,151
There you go.

366
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,227
You're kidding me, right?
There's no such thing as vampires.

367
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:38,363
Well, there's not a lot of documentation

368
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,532
But the stories have been
told since the civil war.

369
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,835
My granddad used to tell me all these
creepy stories when I was little.

370
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,838
And he said that his
granddad told them to him.

371
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,139
Yeah. That would be folklore.

372
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,609
Vampires are a metaphor
for the demons of the day.

373
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,110
Which are?

374
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,646
The union soldiers.
I've read the stories myself.

375
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:57,916
They talk about the enemy,
the demons that attack night.

376
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,252
That sounds like vampires to me.

377
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,188
Allegorical vampires.
Which is what it is.

378
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,890
Creative expression during
a very volatile time.

379
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,426
I mean, a couny at war
doesn't want realism.

380
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,529
They want fantasy.
Thus, vampire fiction.

381
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,166
Man, you're smart.

382
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:18,937
I gotta give it to you.
When I first saw you, I missed it.

383
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,407
Yeah. I've had a rough go of it lately.

384
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,710
But I'm just now getting
back to my old self.

385
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,117
Well, good luck on the paper.
I gotta get home.

386
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,953
You know, my great grandfather
actually showed me a journal once

387
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:38,957
Of an ancestor and he had written all
of this creepy stuff about vampires.

388
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,026
It was actually really believable.

389
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,127
Wait. A journal?

390
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,562
Yeah? Why?

391
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,033

401
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,224
The ground gave way and I fell.

402
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:42,760
It's ok. It's ok. Calm down.

403
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:44,328
Come on, let's get you out of here.

404
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:45,863
How?

405
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,566
Just close your eyes.

406
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:51,335
Trust .

407
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:07,285
You can open your eyes now.

408
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:10,021
Whoa.

409
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,255
I didn't want to scare you.

410
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:12,490
How did you know where I was?

411
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:14,459
Well, your grandmother told
me what you were doing.

412
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:16,461
I guessed the where.

413
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,465
I heard them.

414
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:24,936
Down there. Behind the door.

415
00:24:25,003 --> 00:24:26,871
Are they in pain?

416
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:29,040
In the beginning--yes. But not anymore.

417
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:31,209
They've been starved to
the point of dessication.

418
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:33,711
But if they have blood--

419
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,213
That's not going to happen, bonnie.

420
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,614
They can't get out.

421
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:40,051
Emily saw to that when she
had you destroy the crystal.

422
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,720
You're safe.

423
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:46,491
Ready...Go!

424
00:24:49,228 --> 00:24:52,463
That's 3.

425
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:53,898
Do you need a bib?

426
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:57,635
Sorry I can't unhinge my jaw
like a snake to consume alcohol.

427
00:24:57,703 --> 00:25:00,671
Whatever. All right. Who's next?

428
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:02,206
Another round, bree.

429
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:05,276
Honey, you should be on the floor.

430
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:10,381
I am not even drunk.
My tolerance is, like, way up here.

431
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,619
Bree: All right. Here you go.

432
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:26,130
Jeremy: So, you have no
idea where the journal is?

433
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:27,865
Nope. Gramps died.

434
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:30,401
And all the kids split
his stuff. I can ask.

435
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:33,471
I just find it weird that our ancestors
kept the same kind of journal.

436
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,972
It's crazy.

437
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,009
Maybe it's based in
some partial reality.

438
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:39,110
No. It's gotta be a metaphorical.

439
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:41,279
My ancestor wrote short stories.

440
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:43,981
So, that's why you're hung
up on the fiction of it all.

441
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,983
No, I'm hung up on fiction of it all

442
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:47,985
Because I've seen "the lost boys"

443
00:25:48,053 --> 00:25:49,720
And "near dark," like, 50 times.

444
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:51,989
Are those movies?

445
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:54,759
Hey. I've never seen them.

446
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:56,828
Maybe we can have a fright night

447
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:59,897
And rent a whole bunch
of vampire movies.

448
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:03,835
Uh, yeah, sure.

449
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:08,272
Why does tt sound like a no way in hell?

450
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,008
Sorry, I'm blunt.

451
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:14,745
No, it's--I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

452
00:26:14,813 --> 00:26:17,014
I just recently got out of something,

453
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:19,417
It's a little too soon, you know?

454
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:22,253
Oh please, sure. No worries.

455
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:25,823
I meant as friends. Yeah.

456
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:28,626
Look, I really gotta go.

457
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:33,231
Nice meeting you, jeremy.

458
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:44,075
[cell phone ringing] yeah!

459
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:51,782
Hello? Jenna?

460
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,452
Hold on, it's loud in here.

461
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:58,656
Huh? Yeah. No, I'm good.

462
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:01,692
Eveything's fine. Hold on.
I can't hear you.

463
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Hello?

464
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:10,434
[mumbling]

465
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,330
Hey, where's your girl?

466
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:21,465
Hmm.

467
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,868
She was right back there.

468
00:27:54,032 --> 00:27:55,466
Damon, no.

469
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,775
What t hell?!

470
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,213
No!

471
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:18,055
Who are you?

472
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:22,059
That's pfect. You have no idea.

473
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:23,794
What are you talking aut?
What did he do?

474
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:26,264
He killed my girlfriend.

475
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:33,671
What did she do to you,
huh? What did she do to you?!

476
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:35,606
Nothing.

477
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,009
Elena: I don't understand.

478
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:40,311
My girlfriend went to visit sfan,

479
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:43,047
And damokilled her. Got it?

480
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:47,251
Ugh!

481
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,353
Lexi?

482
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:51,389
Lexi was your girlfriend?

483
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:52,490
She told me about you.

484
00:28:52,557 --> 00:28:54,926
She said you were human.

485
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:57,895
I was.

486
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:07,438
Lexi turned you?

487
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,307
If you want to be with someone forever,

488
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:11,909
You have to live forever.

489
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,551
She loved u.

490
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:24,221
She said, "when it's real,
you can't walk away."

491
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:27,591
Well, that's a choice you're
not going to have to make.

492
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:31,495
Don't. Don't, please, don't hurt him--

493
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:37,368
I'm doing you a favor.

494
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:40,338
Lexi loved y. And she was good.

495
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,606
That means you're good too.

496
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:45,476
Be better than him.

497
00:29:45,544 --> 00:29:48,646
Don't do this. I'm begging you!

498
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:50,848
Please.

499
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:13,838
Thank you.

500
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:18,943
It wasn't for you.

501
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,359
Well, now, look who's
returned from battle

502
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,999
Can I talk to your friend for minute?

503
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:48,905
Thank you.

504
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:54,210
I appreciate your help, stefan.

505
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:57,680
You're welcome, sheila.

506
00:30:58,783 --> 00:31:01,051
I wasn't sure you remembered.

507
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:03,319
October 1969.

508
00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:05,455
I was barely a teenager.

509
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:06,723
And you were leading what was probably

510
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:11,027
The only anti-war si
t-in within miles of mystic falls.

511
00:31:11,095 --> 00:31:12,328
Hmm.

512
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:15,932
You knowwhen you spoke,
people were mesmerized.

513
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:17,967
I know I was.

514
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:21,004
Until the cops showed up.

515
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,741
You took a big risk
coming to see me earlier.

516
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:27,677
Letting me read you,
realize who you were.

517
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:30,780
It could have gone a
completely different way.

518
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:36,386
Your familhas a very long
history of keeping my secret.

519
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:40,957
I knew that I could trust you if you
believed I waworthy of your trust.

520
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,860
Bonnie knows, doesn't she?

521
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:46,729
Yes.

522
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:50,967
Please understand,
our loyalty can only extend so far.

523
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:55,171
This town won't be easy on any
of us if they figure it out.

524
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:58,174
And I'll protect my own
before anybody else.

525
00:31:58,242 --> 00:32:00,443
I know that.

526
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:03,546
As long as we're clear

527
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:07,383
Goodnight, then.

528
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:09,419
Goodnight, sheila.

529
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:24,534
We were just leaving,
and I wanted to sagood bye.

530
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:28,972
Good to see you again, damon.

531
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,141
No ks?

532
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,276
I'm full of vervain.

533
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:35,712
I put it in everything I drink.

534
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,714
And you're telling me this why?

535
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:40,583
Lexi was my friend.

536
00:32:40,651 --> 00:32:43,453
How could you?

537
00:32:46,023 --> 00:32:49,159
The tomb can be opened.

538
00:32:49,226 --> 00:32:50,426
You're lying!

539
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:52,195
Emily's grimoire, her spellbook.

540
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:54,664
If you know how she closed the tomb

541
00:32:54,732 --> 00:32:57,800
The reversal process will be in
her book. You can open that tomb.

542
00:32:57,868 --> 00:32:58,801
D where is this book?

543
00:32:58,869 --> 00:32:59,836
I--I--

544
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,271
You have no idea.

545
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:03,907
No. I'm telling you the truth.

546
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:06,409
And I believe you.

547
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:09,145
My dear, sweet bree.

548
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:11,281
That's why I'm almost sorry.

549
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:13,550
Ugh!

550
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:40,519
So, why did you bring me with you?

551
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:44,323
Wellyou're not the worst
company in the world, elena.

552
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,225
You ould give yourself more credit.

553
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:47,560
Seriously?

554
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:52,865
You were there in the road.
All damsel in distress-like.

555
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:54,767
And I knew it would piss off stefan.

556
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:56,769
And...

557
00:33:56,837 --> 00:34:01,107
U're not the worst company
in the world, elena.

558
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:04,643
I used to be more fun.

559
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,345
You did ok.

560
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:09,615
I saved your life.

561
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:12,017
I know.

562
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:14,253
And don't you forget it.

563
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:30,102
[footsteps approaching]

564
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:32,538
Hi.

565
00:34:32,606 --> 00:34:33,906
Hi.

566
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:38,310
You coulhave told me.

567
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,079
I wanted to tell you.

568
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:43,616
You said no more lies. Only the truth.

569
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:46,018
I can handle the truth, stefan.

570
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:47,686
As crazy as it is,

571
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:51,424
I can handle the fact
that you are a vampire.

572
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:54,560
D you have a vampire brother.

573
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:57,696
And that my best friend is a witch.

574
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:02,201
I can accept the fact that the
world is much more mysterious place

575
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,502
Than I ever thought possible.

576
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:09,508
But this--this lie, I can't take.

577
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:11,577
What am I to you?

578
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:13,612
Who am I to you?

579
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,748
You are not katherine.

580
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:18,617
You are the opposite
everything that she was.

581
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:20,119
And when did you figure that out?

582
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,787
Before you kissed me?

583
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:24,623
Before we slept together?

584
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:28,727
Before I met you.

585
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,063
What?

586
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:37,503
The first day of school. We when met.

587
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:39,805
It wasn't for the first time, elena.

588
00:35:41,107 --> 00:35:43,008
Then when was it?

589
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:45,744
May 23, 2009.

590
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,413
But that was--

591
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:52,518
That was the day your parents'
car went off the bridge.

592
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,988
You were the?

593
00:35:56,056 --> 00:35:58,557
Every couple of years
that I come back here

594
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:02,428
To see zach and see my home.

595
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:08,667
Last spring, I was out in the woods,
by old wickery bridge.

596
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:13,339
And I heard the accident. All of it.

597
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:17,142
I was fast getting there,
but not fast enough.

598
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,813
The car was already submerged.

599
00:36:22,048 --> 00:36:25,818
Your dad was still-
he was still conscious.

600
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:27,253
I was able to get to him,

601
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,825
But he wouldn't let me help
him until I helped you.

602
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:35,094
Oh my god.

603
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:39,932
When I woke up in the hospital,

604
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,537
Nobody could figure out
how I got out of the car.

605
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:48,173
They said it was a miracle.

606
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:51,510
I went back for them.
But it was too late.

607
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:53,812
I couldn't--

608
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,582
I couldn't save them.

609
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,319
When I pulled you out,
I looked at your face.

610
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:03,522
You looked like katherine.
I couldn't believe the resemblance.

611
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,726
After that, I spent months
making sure th you weren't her.

612
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:11,330
I watched you. I learned
everythi that I could about you.

613
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,900
And I saw that you were
nothing like katherine.

614
00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:19,371
And I wanted to leave town,
but, elena, I couldn't.

615
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:22,541
I couldn't leave without knowing you.

616
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:25,311
I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you.

617
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:29,148
I wanted to. But you were so sad.

618
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:35,554
Why do I look like her?

619
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:39,625
Elena, you've been thrgh so much.

620
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:43,963
Why do I look like her,
stefan? What are you not telling me?

621
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,099
It didn't make any sense  me.

622
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,902
You were a gilbert. She was a pierce.

623
00:37:50,003 --> 00:37:52,705
But the resemblance was too similar.

624
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,773
And then I learned the truth.

625
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,677
You were adopted, elena.

626
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:03,282
There you are.

627
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,316
Hey.

628
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:06,418
All right,ook.

629
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:10,356
I know I don't know you,
so don't ask me why I did this.

630
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:13,892
I just, sometimes-- mostly all the time-

631
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,361
I have this need to be right.

632
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:18,097
So I googled and...

633
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:19,398
What is it?

634
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,834
Proof. Sort of.

635
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:31,677
What does this mean?

636
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:33,746
Well, I only went as far back as 1942,

637
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:36,548
And found that there's been
a string of animal attacks

638
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:40,719
Periodically in and around this
town for the past 75 years.

639
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:43,088
It's consistent.

640
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:46,225
In '62, 5 boes found.

641
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,460
In '53, 4 people killed.

642
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:52,698
In '74, 3 people dead.
And there's been 5 this year.

643
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:54,033
All attacked.

644
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:59,204
All suffered major blood loss,
as in drained of blood.

645
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,709
How do you know th?

646
00:39:03,777 --> 00:39:07,880
Your birth certificate
from the city records.

647
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:11,050
It says elena gilbert.
Mystic falls general.

648
00:39:11,117 --> 00:39:14,987
But there's no record of your
mother ever being admitted.

649
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:19,191
There's no record of her
ever being pregnant.

650
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:20,959
What else do you know?

651
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:24,263
For me to go any further, I would've
had to look into the pierce family,

652
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,465
And I couldn do that.
It's too much of a risk.

653
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,134
If seone found out I was
asking about katherine--

654
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:31,670
Listen to me, it doesn't matter.

655
00:39:31,771 --> 00:39:35,674
You are the woman that I love.

656
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,278
I love you.

657
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:05,404
I don't set a lot of rules, elena.

658
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:08,474
Not with you. I trust you
to tell me the truth.

659
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:11,710
Where were you? Why would
you lie to me about it?

660
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,579
I thought that we were closer than that.

661
00:40:13,646 --> 00:40:15,314
Now is not the time you want
to talk to me about lies.

662
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,282
Don't do that.
Don't turn this back on me.

663
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,684
I didn't do anything.

664
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:22,254
Ok, question-- am I apted?

665
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:26,992
I trust you to tell me
the truth too, jenna.

666
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,561
How coulyou not tell me?

667
00:40:29,629 --> 00:40:31,997
I thought we were closer than that.

668
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,901
Elena, didn't-- they asked me not to.

669
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:37,436
I don't want to hear it!

670
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:53,719
Lexi: Love you.

671
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,121
I'm going to be late tonight.

Previouslye on "the vampire diaries"...

2
00:00:02,332 --> 00:00:04,700
For over a century, I have lived in secret,

3
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:07,269
Until now. I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

4
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:09,037
Elena, she's a dead ringer for katherine.

5
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,973
Our love for katherine wasn't real, damon.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,141
I'm gonna bring her back.

7
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,509
I'm anna. Uh, jemy.

8
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:15,544
You know, my grea
t-grandfather actually showed me

9
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:17,079
A journal. He had written all of this

10
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:18,147
Creepy stuff about vampires.

11
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:19,148
Your tur

12
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:20,516
Any sad relationship stories?

13
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,519
Fell in love, married young...

14
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:26,121
Wifeied.

15
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,390
I've never been in your room before.

16
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,691
Elena?

17
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:31,860
Who am I  you?

18
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:32,961
You are not katherine.

19
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:34,196
Why do I look like her?

20
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:36,165
You were adopted.

21
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:50,012
Aah! How you doin' in there?

22
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:54,082
Stefan, who was that man in the road?

23
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,420
I don't know. Do you remember
anything else about him?

24
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:02,424
I wish. I never really saw his face.

25
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:04,092
He was wearing a hoodie.

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,864
All I caremember is that there was
these black boots coming towards me.

27
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:11,600
I brought some vervain

28
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:14,169
For, um-- for you and jenna.

29
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:17,439
And, um, I made this bracelet for jeremy,

30
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:19,107
Few extra on for friends.

31
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,143
You can put it in jewelry,

32
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:24,179
Or you can even put it in food or drink,

33
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:27,583
But as long as it's in you or on you,

34
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,585
A vampire cann control you.

35
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:31,420
Wow. So mucho remember.

36
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:34,756
I know, but there's another vampire in tow

37
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:38,293
So until we find out who
it is and what he wants,

38
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:39,795
We have to be careful.

39
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:51,607
Hey.

40
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:54,610
It's gonna be $22.

41
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,345
Elena, I need the money!

42
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:59,414
Uh, here. Come in. Just put it on the table.

43
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:07,856
Hi.

44
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:11,093
Um, keep the change.

45
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:13,829
Thanks.

46
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:16,064
And you have yourself a good night.

47
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,153
What are you lookin' for, damon?

48
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,221
Not your concern.

49
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:42,190
No, but putting elena in harm's way,

50
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:43,825
That is my concern. Heh heh.

51
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:45,360
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:46,862
I'm talking about atlanta.

53
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:50,098
Oh, yeah. Elena and I haa blast.

54
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:52,934
I get it.

55
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,403
You're just bitter because onof us

56
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,204
Gets to be with the person that we love,

57
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:59,574
And poor katherine is just out of reach.

58
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:01,877
Unless there's anoth way for
you to get into that tomb.

59
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:03,412
Is that what bree said?

60
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,646
You're pathetic when you're fishing.

61
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:06,715
You're transparent when you're deflecting.

62
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:09,718
Don't you have school?

63
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,229
Surprised? It's a good essay.

64
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:24,132
Your thoughts are clear,
and your argument is well laid out.

65
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,967
It's just, uh, you don't actually

66
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:29,004
Think the are vampires in mystic falls.

67
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,773
No. I mean, I think
statistically there's been

68
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,409
More animal attacks, mystious deaths, uh,

69
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:36,878
People gone missing,
more than any other place

70
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:38,347
In the whole commonwealth of virginia.

71
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,482
It's conjecture,

72
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,418
But creative, which is why you got the "a."

73
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:45,354
I just wouldn't get too, uh, caught up

74
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:47,189
In the whole conspiracy theory of it all.

75
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:48,423
Ah, I won't.

76
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,424
All right.

77
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,727
Oh, uh, jeremy,

78
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:53,395
The source that you cited

79
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:57,065
For the 1860s info, uh, jonathan gilbert...

80
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,100
Uh, my ancestor's journal?

81
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,535
I'd really like to see that sometime.

82
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:01,503
Really?

83
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:02,571
A first-person account

84
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:04,940
Of the civil war? That's like, uh,

85
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,708
Porn for a history teacher.

86
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:08,777
You think my essay's creative,

87
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:11,513
Wait till you get a load of this thing.

88
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:14,883
Thank you.

89
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,193
It's so pretty.

90
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:26,495
Thank you.

91
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:28,797
God, it'll go with, like, everythi.

92
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,265
At's the occasion?

93
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,300
No occasion. Just a little friend gift.

94
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:33,235
Lesbian friend necklace?

95
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:35,070
'cause we're freaky like that?

96
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,038
Your friendship is important to me.

97
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:39,474
Why aryou being so mushy?

98
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,077
Because you've been avoiding me,

99
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:43,578
And I wanted you to know that whatever

100
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:46,381
Is going on with you and matt, it's ok.

101
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:50,552
I was gonna talk to you about that.

102
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,653
I was,

103
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:54,222
But there's just not much to say.

104
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,258
We've hung out a couple times.

105
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:59,261
That's it, but...

106
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:02,898
I just feel like we've peed as friends.

107
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,400
This is weird.

108
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:07,235
I shouldn't be talking you about this.

109
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:08,937
It's weird. It's weird, ght?

110
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,305
It's a little weird, but--heh.

111
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:13,608
If it's what you and matt want,
then it's not about me.

112
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,211
But it's all about you.

113
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:19,414
Matt's not over you, and we all know it.

114
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:20,749
I'm with stefan w.

115
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:21,750
Matt understands that.

116
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:23,785
He kno he has to move on.

117
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:32,828
Matt donovan. What do you know?

118
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:34,563
Ben mckittrick. What's up, man?

119
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,897
Rough season, bud.

120
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:37,632
Yeah. It's kind of rd to recover

121
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,468
When you have to forfeit half your games.

122
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:41,736
You gonna be workin' here?

123
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:44,105
Yep, followin' in your footsteps,

124
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:46,775
Minus the ate championship.

125
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:48,543
Well, can't all be football gods.

126
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:49,478
Yeah.

127
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:52,080
So what's the plan? Cook line?

128
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:54,416
Busboy.

129
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,589
I n't believe you're adopted.

130
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,858
I never saw that coming.
And it gets weirder.

131
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,226
I looked at my birth certificate.

132
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:06,561
It lists miranda and grayson
gilbert as my birthparents.

133
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:07,929
None oit makes any sense.

134
00:06:07,997 --> 00:06:09,264
Which is why you should ask jenna.

135
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,200
First of all, the elena I know

136
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,569
Would always want the
real truth, good or bad.

137
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,037
And second of all?

138
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:18,773
You just found out your
boyfriend is a vampire,

139
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:21,943
So unless your birthparents are aliens...

140
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:23,545
How bad could it be?

141
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:26,882
Ah, ok, look, I have to go to the store.

142
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,484
My outfit for the dance is
severely lacking accessories.

143
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:31,386
Ok, I'll pay the bill.

144
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:32,487
Ok. Bye.

145
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:33,989
Bye.

146
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,326
What do you want from me?

147
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:40,595
I think we need a fresh start.

148
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:41,863
You tried to kill me.

149
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:44,733
But I didn't, and if I wanted to,
I would have.

150
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,268
Does that not count for anything?

151
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:48,537
You know, I can start fires with my mind.

152
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:49,804
Fires kill vampires, right?

153
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,009
Just stay the hell away from me.

154
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:56,411
Everything ok over here?

155
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,246
Yeah, we're fine.

156
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:00,949
I wasn't talkin' to you.

157
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:09,491
Heh.

158
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:13,595
Thank you.

159
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,597
Ytime, bonnie.

160
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:17,566
Wait. Yoremember me?

161
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,701
I didn't graduate thatong ago.

162
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:21,436
You're makin' me feel old.

163
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:22,904
Sorry. I didn't--

164
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:27,442
I didn't mean that.
I just-- I didn't know you knew me.

165
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,912
I always know a pretty face.

166
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,525
Hello.

167
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,492
hello, elena.

168
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,861
Hey, who's this?

169
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,997
You hit me with your car.

170
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,733
Is that a new one?

171
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:56,538
You got away from me.

172
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,206
You won't next time.

173
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,172
Why me? What does he want with me,

174
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,740
A-and if he's trying to kill me,

175
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:12,707
Then why call first?

176
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:14,910
That's because we're predators, ena.

177
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:16,144
We hunt. We stalk.

178
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,814
It's often as exciting as the kill.

179
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,350
I want you to take this.

180
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:25,687
This is jeremy's pocket watch.

181
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,788
How did you get it?

182
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,456
I took it from damon,
who took it from logan,

183
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:29,591
Who must have taken it from you.

184
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,259
What happened to it?

185
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,361
Well, it's n just a watch.

186
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,864
It's a-- it's a sort of compass,

187
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,034
But it points to vampires.

188
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,945
Why did my father have it?

189
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,613
Gilberts were one of the founding families,

190
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:54,382
And back in 1864, th were among those

191
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,785
Who sought to eradicate the vampires.

192
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:59,487
The compass was used to find us.

193
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,657
Did you know them?

194
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,460
Yes.

195
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,396
I want you to keep this.

196
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,932
That way, you'll know if
you're ever in danger.

197
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:23,478
I've nevereen you such a mess.

198
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,380
don't talk smack.

199
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:29,417
I mean, I just thought that you
told everyone else what to do.

200
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,486
Well, I do that, too,

201
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:33,588
But if you want something done right,

202
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,724
You gotta do it yourself.

203
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,131
You know, I just like
that we're hanging out.

204
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,466
Who knew--you and me?

205
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,468
Well, who knew yocould be fun?

206
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,039
So what are you wearing to
this dumb dance, anyway?

207
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:53,208
Should we color-coordinate?

208
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,976
Uh, I'm not goin'.

209
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:56,378
Why not?

210
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:59,247
I gotta work, bussin' tables at the grill.

211
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:01,650
Since when are you a busboy?

212
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,486
It's a job.

213
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:07,522
You know, some of us have to work, caroline.

214
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,558
With our mom in and out,
things are tight, so...

215
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,060
I didn't mean it like that.

216
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,829
I just meant that I
didn't know you had a job.

217
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,798
Well, I do.

218
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,367
I gotta go.

219
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:26,775
Hey.

220
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:27,842
How'd it go?

221
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,010
What?

222
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:30,312
The paper.

223
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,513
Oh. I got an "a."

224
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,114
Thanks for the artles. They really helped.

225
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,817
Cool. So what'd he say about the vampir?

226
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,952
Did he believe it?

227
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,721
I don't even believe it.
It's just a paper, anna.

228
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,489
Anyways, I, uh-- I gotta get goin'.

229
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,992
Uh, hey, um...

230
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,561
D-do you wanna do something later, maybe?

231
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:49,931
Uh, sorry. I'm stuck on punch
duty at the school dance.

232
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,866
Oh. How'd you get stuck with that?

233
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,502
Well, I'm failin' english,
so I copped a plea.

234
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,107
Maybe, you know, tomorrow or something.

235
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,912
I'm being pushy again, aren't I?

236
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,247
Heh.

237
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,450
Well, thanks for the help. I'll--

238
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,218
I'll see you around.

239
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:20,161
Spoke to the insurance company.

240
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:22,130
Car's totaled.

241
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,266
You can keep using mine for now.

242
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,901
So you're coming to the dance?

243
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:30,772
Alaric askede to help chaperone.

244
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,913
Why didn't you tell me, jenna?

245
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,984
Your mom was gonna do it eventually.

246
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,053
I never thought I'd have to.

247
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,155
If my mom were here right now

248
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:50,225
And I asked, she'd tell me the truth.

249
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:57,732
Your dad was about to
leave the office one night

250
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,235
When this girl showed up.

251
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:04,939
She was 16, a runaway,
and about to give birth.

252
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:09,844
He delivered her baby,
and he gave her a place to stay,

253
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,347
But a few days later, she disappeared.

254
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,884
And there you were.

255
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:19,087
Your parents were trying
so hard to have a baby.

256
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,688
I-it just wasn'tappening.

257
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:25,126
All miranda ever wanted was to be a mom.

258
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:28,963
Well, why were my parents'
names on the birth certicate?

259
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,632
Your dad was a doctor, elena.

260
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,000
He took care of it.

261
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:35,570
They didn't wanna lose you,
so they kept it quiet,

262
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:37,372
Told as fepeople as possible,

263
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,275
But if anyone ever wanted proof,
they had documtation.

264
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,012
What else do you know about her?

265
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,113
The girl.

266
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,915
Just her name.

267
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:49,217
Isabelle.

268
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:03,665
You got the hair right.

269
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,103
Why are you bringing me dad's journa

270
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,171
'cause you were looking for it.

271
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,506
D why would I want it?

272
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,241
Gee, I don't know, damon.

273
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:16,644
Maybe you wanna do a little
bit of posthumous bonding.

274
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,547
Go ahead. Enjoy it. Read it.

275
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:23,651
I have. Nowhere in it does it
say anything about katherine

276
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,487
Or the tomb or how to open it.

277
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,554
I'm not surprised.

278
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,723
Man could rely spell his own name.

279
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,724
I'm really sorry

280
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,426
That it won't be of any help with

281
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:35,163
Your diabolical plan, the sequel.

282
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:38,833
You know, I could help you.

283
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,636
You, help me?

284
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:43,204
Aw, I don't know.

285
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:44,939
Seems a little unnatural.

286
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:48,943
I'll do anythingo get you out of this town,

287
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:49,944
Even release katherine.

288
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,379
What about the other 26 vampires?

289
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,081
No, no, no. They can't come.

290
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:55,450
They have to stay put, but katherine,

291
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,051
I would consider that.

292
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,421
What are you doin'? Hmm?

293
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,123
What's your angle?

294
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:04,592
Think about it.

295
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,631
Why would I trust you?

296
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:11,399
See that's your problem, damon.

297
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,968
You apply all of your
shortcomings to everybody else.

298
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:16,704
If history's any indication,

299
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,474
There's only one liar among us.

300
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,522
Hey,enna.

301
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,458
Jenna?

302
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,126
Jeremy?

303
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,588
Stefan's phone. How mai help you?

304
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:41,522
Where is he?

305
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,624
He's on his way to you,

306
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,092
Forgotis phone.

307
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,462
thank god. This compass was spinning.

308
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,064
Stefan must be here. Thank you.

309
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,599
You're welcome.

310
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,170
aah!

311
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,180
Are you ok?

312
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,016
Are you ok?

313
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,917
Ok.

314
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,285
How did he get in?

315
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:18,054
He was invited in.

316
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:21,157
He posed as a pizza delivery guy last night.

317
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:22,725
Well, he gets points fothat.

318
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:24,293
Did he say what he wanted?

319
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:26,696
No. He was too busy trying to kill me.

320
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:28,831
And you have no idea who this is?

321
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,366
No.

322
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:32,702
Don't look at me like that.

323
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,003
I told you we had company.

324
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:35,772
You think there's more than one?

325
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,540
We don't know.

326
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:43,212
Damon, he was invited in.

327
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,684
Then we go get him tonight.

328
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:50,019
You up for it?

329
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,888
What do I have to do?

330
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:53,956
Let your boyfriend take you to the dance.

331
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:55,291
Wel see who shows up.

332
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,160
That's a bad idea.

333
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:58,895
Till we get him, this house isn't safe.

334
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:01,597
For anyone who lives in it.

335
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,201
It's worth a shot.

336
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,904
I'll do it.

337
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:17,346
I'll be with the o of you. I'll be safe.

338
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:51,681
Alaric.

339
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:55,151
Hey, look at you.

340
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,820
I figured I'd stand out
less if I dressed up.

341
00:17:57,888 --> 00:17:59,188
Heh heh. Liar.

342
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:01,457
Ok, I'm a sucker for the decade dance.

343
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,326
I went to school here, you know.

344
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:05,928
They do the sixts and seventies, too, fyi.

345
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:08,064
Oh. Can't wait.

346
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,066
Can I get you a drink?

347
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,635
I hear the punch is real boss.

348
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:14,103
Heh.

349
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,776
Having fun?

350
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:24,547
No, but this took about 2 hours,

351
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:27,216
So I'm at least staying half of that.

352
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:29,218
What's damon doing here?

353
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:34,423
He wanted to come.

354
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:36,592
I promise. He'll behave.

355
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,194
So what is this, like, a threesome now,

356
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:39,428
You and the salvatore brothers?

357
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,531
No, but if I'm gonna be with stefan,

358
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,399
Then I have to learn to tolerate damon.

359
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,067
It's not like I can kill him.

360
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:46,135
There's a thought.

361
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,970
Mmm. I'll help.

362
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:52,408
I'm really starting to
see a change in jeremy.

363
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:53,409
Finally.

364
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:55,745
Uh, losing someone you love so suddenly,

365
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:58,080
The, uh--the trauma and the grief ther

366
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:01,651
Are some of the tougher
things 'll face in life.

367
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:05,221
From someone who knows.

368
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:07,156
You have no idea what happened?

369
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:10,326
That's the hard part, not knowing.

370
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,562
Is it ok to talk about your wife?

371
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,131
Heh. There's not much to talk about.

372
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:19,068
Th must be impossible to deal with,
not having any answers.

373
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:23,906
I'd be lying to you if I told you
it didn't keep me up at night.

374
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:26,576
Wondering why, by who,

375
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:29,378
Maybe one day.

376
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:31,747
Hope so.

377
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,285
Hope so.

378
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:47,263
Hi, bonnie.

379
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:49,465
Wanna dance?

380
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,567
I'm out of here.

381
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,803
Please give me another chance.

382
00:19:56,273 --> 00:19:57,807
Back off, damon.

383
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:02,378
Where did ey go?

384
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:04,180
I don't know.

385
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,915
What'd you say to 'em?

386
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:07,850
I was perfectly polite.

387
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:09,619
Elena...

388
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:12,421
Would you like to dance?

389
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:14,256
I would love to.

390
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,959
May I have is dance?

391
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,544
Shouldn't u guys be able to
sense each other or something?

392
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:58,946
No. Doesn't work that way.

393
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:00,614
See him anywhere?

394
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:02,850
Not unless he has a pompadour.

395
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:06,053
Heh. Wow. Was not one of
the better fashion trends.

396
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:09,022
Come on. I'm sure you
looked great back then.

397
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,023
Are there pictures?

398
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:12,493
No. Burned. Buried.

399
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,629
Seriously, what was it like, the fifties?

400
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:18,699
'cause in my mind,
I have this picture of somewhere

401
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,134
Between "american bandstand," "grease."

402
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,736
It's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes.

403
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:26,573
Well, that and, you know, mccarthyism

404
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,575
And segregation and nuclear arms race.

405
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:30,577
Ok, but there were poodle skirts.

406
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:33,180
There were poodle skirts.

407
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:37,384
You're so teaching me
how to do the hand jive.

408
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:38,852
No. That's not gonna happen.

409
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,087
Ooh!

410
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:57,337
You neglected to mention
this was a theme party.

411
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:58,472
What are you doin' here?

412
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,108
Well, seeing ayou also
neglected to invite me,

413
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:02,876
I took matters into my own hands.

414
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:04,678
You're doin' that thing again.

415
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:05,779
What thing would that be?

416
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:07,481
That thing where you pretend we're dating,

417
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:08,582
Even though we're not.

418
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,919
Oh, you mean stalking. Yeah.

419
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:14,121
Heh. Get over yourself.

420
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:17,558
Come on. I've never been
to a school dance before.

421
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,092
Humor me.

422
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:27,868
Let's sit up there.

423
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:30,237
Be a little more obvious, bonnie.

424
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:32,306
Don't rain on my hot-guy parade.

425
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:34,575
What? It's just a drizzle.

426
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:37,010
Ben mckittrick? Really?

427
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,746
He's hot.

428
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:42,649
He's a washed-up jock who
pours drinks for a living.

429
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:44,718
You could do way better.

430
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:45,953
Y.

431
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,387
What's up?

432
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:07,975
Yeah, I don't recognize you.

433
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:10,277
How'd you get roped into chaperoning?

434
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,946
Alaric saltzman.

435
00:23:13,014 --> 00:23:14,615
I'm the new history teacher.

436
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:18,752
Ah, the, uh, cursed faculty position.

437
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,988
So I've been told.

438
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:23,423
Damon. Salvatore.

439
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:25,392
Salvatore, as in, uh, sfan?

440
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,227
He's my little brother

441
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:30,530
I'm his legal guardian,
hence the chaperoning.

442
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:31,865
I hear he's very bright,

443
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:34,568
Not that I've had a
chance to see for myself.

444
00:23:34,636 --> 00:23:36,937
Well, his attendance
record's a little spotty.

445
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:39,172
Family drama.

446
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,974
Arents?

447
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:43,844
Mm, it's just the two of us now.

448
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,381
You, uh--you live here your whole life?

449
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:48,849
On and off.

450
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,450
Travel a bit.

451
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:52,552
Really? Where?

452
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,187
Around the states?

453
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:58,125
Heh. I'm sorry.

454
00:23:58,192 --> 00:24:00,727
I'm nosy. I--I don't mn to pry.

455
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:03,063
Look, it was nice meeting you.

456
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:04,531
You, too.

457
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,366
Enjoy the rest of the dance.

458
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,578
Tonight was so much better on paper.

459
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:20,514
Ah, you're just feeling sorry for yourself.

460
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:21,848
Go and tk to him.

461
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,417
Be bold and fearless.

462
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:25,485
Yeah, this coming from the girl who's

463
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:26,820
Been eye stalking the bartender.

464
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:29,690
You're right.

465
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,700
Hi.

466
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,168
Twice in one day.

467
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:42,102
Lucky me.

468
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:43,337
I'm proving something to my friend.

469
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:45,072
Oh, yeah? What's that?

470
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:48,675
That you don't have to sit around and
wait for a guy to come up to you.

471
00:24:48,743 --> 00:24:51,044
Does that mean that you're
asking me out on a date?

472
00:24:51,112 --> 00:24:52,879
Does that mean you want me to?

473
00:24:52,947 --> 00:24:54,881
Well, what did you have in mind?

474
00:24:57,652 --> 00:24:58,919
Do you like karaoke?

475
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,487
No.

476
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:05,425
But I would really like
to go on a date with you.

477
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:16,737
Seriously?

478
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:17,871
Is that for me?

479
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:20,540
Do you see anyone else in the vicinity?

480
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:21,708
Do you need something?

481
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:24,344
Are you mad at me or something?

482
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:25,712
No, care. I'm not mad. I--

483
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,580
Well, then why are you being so weird?

484
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:27,881
I'm not. I'm working.

485
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:28,982
You're avoiding.

486
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,984
No. I have a table to clean.

487
00:25:31,052 --> 00:25:33,153
You know, that's the kind of thing

488
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:35,622
That washed-up jocks do to make a living.

489
00:25:42,997 --> 00:25:44,231
You don't go to school here.

490
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:45,866
You know, you don't have to help.

491
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:46,867
Oh, I don't mi.

492
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:48,568
It's fun.

493
00:25:48,636 --> 00:25:50,137
Oh, um, yeah. Before I forget,

494
00:25:50,204 --> 00:25:51,872
Can I borrow your anctor's journal?

495
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:52,939
Why?

496
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:54,074
You said I could read it.

497
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:56,743
Uh, I don't have it.

498
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:59,346
Oh. Ll, obviously you didn't bring it here,

499
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:01,481
Uh, but I can walk you home.

500
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:03,283
No. I mean, I gave it to my history teacher.

501
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:05,919
Wait. Why did you give it to him?

502
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:07,587
Because he wanted to read it.

503
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:10,123
You know, you shouldn't be
giving that to just anybody.

504
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:11,591
But I should give it to you?

505
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:13,927
Loan. Loan it to me.

506
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:15,762
Well, I loaned it to mr. Saltzman.

507
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,098
Maybe he's in his classroom.
We can get it back.

508
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:21,068
What's the big deal with the stupid journal?

509
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:24,671
Your eye.

510
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:28,108
Um, there's something in it.

511
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:30,010
Forget it. I gotta go.

512
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:42,689
Maybe he's not gonna show.

513
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,692
You mean we did all this
dancing for nothing?

514
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,328
Ahh. The horror.

515
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:49,830
I'm really sorry for all this.

516
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:50,931
It's my choice.

517
00:26:50,998 --> 00:26:52,232
I decided to be here.

518
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,700
I officially signed up for it,

519
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:57,037
So I don't wanna hear
you apologizing anymore.

520
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:03,243
Show me how it's done in the fifties.

521
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:05,078
Uh, no.

522
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:06,847
Come on. One move?

523
00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:22,395
Now you remember that,

524
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:24,731
Because it's never gonna happen again.

525
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,917
What a you doin' here?

526
00:27:43,985 --> 00:27:46,953
Trying to get the journal,
as in sticking to the plan,

527
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:48,155
Something you're not doing.

528
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:49,589
leave thgirl alone.

529
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:51,191
I like her.

530
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:52,626
She looks like katherine.

531
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:53,693
She's not katherine.

532
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:55,695
Ok, katherine is in the tomb.

533
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:57,297
I know, but until we open that tomb,

534
00:27:57,365 --> 00:27:58,331
I got her to play with.

535
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,432
Dot be stupid.

536
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,767
That girl is with the salvatore brothers.

537
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:02,502
Th don't scare me. They never have.

538
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,305
Please, no. Don't do this.

539
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:06,640
You're gonna ruin everything.

540
00:28:06,707 --> 00:28:08,275
You got noth' to worry about.

541
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:10,544
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

542
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:12,646
You will get what you came for.

543
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:15,182
Just let me have my fun.

544
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:19,920
She looks like katherine.

545
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:43,559
You really can't take him anywhere, can you?

546
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:45,260
Uh, no.

547
00:28:48,365 --> 00:28:50,766
Stefan,

548
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,801
The back corner.

549
00:28:56,406 --> 00:28:58,040
Get damon.

550
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,860
What did I do?

551
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:18,861
Where ise?

552
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:20,496
I was getting a soda,

553
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:22,431
Anthen this guy gave me his hoodie.

554
00:29:30,874 --> 00:29:32,541
hello, elena.

555
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,911
Here's what you're going to do.

556
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:38,881
There's an exit door behind you.

557
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,749
You have 5 seconds.

558
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:43,285
No. Or your brother dies.

559
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:47,823
I can snap his neck so fast I
bet there's not even a witness.

560
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:48,791
Start walking.

561
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:50,726
Don't you dare touch him.

562
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:53,229
Keep walking.

563
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:54,864
Through the door.

564
00:30:41,344 --> 00:30:42,912
Ahh!

565
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:07,837
Yaah!

566
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:11,607
Hey, dickhead.

567
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:14,743
Nobody wants to kill you. Just wanna talk.

568
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,453
Now you feel like talkin'?

569
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,622
Screw you.

570
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,626
Wrong answer.

571
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:32,228
Why are you doing this?

572
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:34,029
Cause it's fun.

573
00:31:37,802 --> 00:31:39,603
What do you want with elena?

574
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:43,139
She looks like katherine.

575
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:47,377
You knew katherine?

576
00:31:47,445 --> 00:31:51,314
Oh. You thought you were the only ones.

577
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:55,118
You don't even remember me.

578
00:31:55,186 --> 00:31:57,554
Tell me how to get in the tomb. Hmm?

579
00:31:57,622 --> 00:31:59,089
No.

580
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:01,625
Uhh!

581
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:08,298
The grimoire. Where is it?

582
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,572
Check the journal. The journal.

583
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:19,442
Jonathan gilbert's.

584
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:25,649
Who else is working with you?

585
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:32,022
Who else is the?

586
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:33,423
No.

587
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:35,725
You're gonna have to kill me.

588
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:03,620
What do we--how are you
gonna find the others now?

589
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:05,288
He had to die.

590
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:06,756
But...

591
00:33:06,824 --> 00:33:10,927
Elena, he's been inted in.

592
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:19,570
Go. I got this.

593
00:33:30,148 --> 00:33:32,383
y.

594
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:33,684
What were you doing?

595
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:35,686
Looking for ms. Hilden.

596
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:37,822
Why are you in mystic falls?

597
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:39,123
I got a job as a teacher.

598
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:41,125
Do you know what I am?
You're my student's brother.

599
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:43,027
Is everything you're telling me the truth?

600
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:44,028
Yes.

601
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:46,731
Then forget we had this conversation.

602
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:06,858
There's no way that idiot was workin' alone.

603
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:09,427
You are.

604
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:12,430
So the grimoire...

605
00:34:12,498 --> 00:34:14,165
That was emily's, right?

606
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:16,935
That's what you need to reverse the spell.

607
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:19,470
When the founding families burned her,
they took her things,

608
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:22,373
And you were hoping that dad's
journal would tell you where it is.

609
00:34:23,442 --> 00:34:26,444
Look at u puttin' the pieces together.

610
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:28,613
Good for you.

611
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:30,248
I was half-right.

612
00:34:30,316 --> 00:34:32,216
Well, it's out there now.

613
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:34,986
Let the games begin.

614
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:37,088
My offer still stands.

615
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:39,457
Yeah, with some hidden caveats, no dou.

616
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,326
No. Nothing hidden about it.

617
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:42,527
No lies. No deception.

618
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:45,163
I'm there when you open up that tomb,

619
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,699
You and katherine go,

620
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:49,567
And the other 26 vampires die.

621
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:51,803
If I agree I'll help you.

622
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,905
Why should I trust you?
Because I'm your brother.

623
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:55,340
No, that's not gonna cut it.

624
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:57,175
Because I want you gone.

625
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,584
Ok.

626
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:13,925
Looki said something stupid.

627
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:17,762
I'm sorry, but I wasn't
even taing about you.

628
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,831
Yes, you were, caroline.

629
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:22,200
Ben could easily be .

630
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:23,134
We're just alike.

631
00:35:23,202 --> 00:35:24,235
That's not true.

632
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:26,204
Are you seriouy mad about this?

633
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,906
Matt, you know me.

634
00:35:28,974 --> 00:35:31,042
Ok, I say stupid things without thinking,

635
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,245
And then I have to apologize
and take it back, and...

636
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:37,582
I'm a terrible, awful person,
but I'm rking on it.

637
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,418
Look, can we just not do this right now?

638
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:42,720
Ok.

639
00:35:42,788 --> 00:35:44,922
When do you get off?

640
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:46,891
Look, this thing we've got,

641
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,726
It's nice, and it feels really good,

642
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:50,828
And I know you wna take the next step.

643
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:51,996
How do you know that?

644
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:53,364
Have you even asked me?

645
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:56,868
I'm--I'm not over elena.

646
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:02,073
I mean, I don't know if I am,
but if we go there,

647
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:05,209
Then it could mess things up,
and we might lose this,

648
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:08,546
And this is the only good thi
I've got going for me right now.

649
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:10,815
So if it doesn't work,
I'll just disappoint you

650
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:13,317
And hurt you, and I don't wanna do that.

651
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,089
Well, big problem, matt,

652
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:21,092
Because you took the next
step all by yourself,

653
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,294
And you played the whole
thing out in your head,

654
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:26,097
And you decided to bail
before even giving it a shot.

655
00:36:26,165 --> 00:36:28,733
So this really great thing that we have,

656
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,635
Don't worry about losing it,

657
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:32,670
'cause it's already gone.

658
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:41,813
Thank you.

659
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
I needed that.

660
00:36:42,948 --> 00:36:44,549
Well, thank you for--for coming.

661
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:45,883
I--I really appreciate it.

662
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:48,086
You made the evening much more...

663
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:52,590
Well, you made it, period.

664
00:36:52,658 --> 00:36:53,958
I'm glad I could help.

665
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:57,061
And thank you for puttinup
with all that wife talk.

666
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:58,496
I--I gotta stop doin' that.

667
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:01,199
It doesn't bode well for dating.

668
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:04,802
Is that what this was, a date?

669
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,337
No, definitely not a date.

670
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:07,338
Oh.

671
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:08,506
But Friday...

672
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:11,542
You, me, and dinner and a movie,

673
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,444
That could be a date.

674
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:15,813
How 'bout it?

675
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:17,115
Works for me.

676
00:37:17,182 --> 00:37:18,316
Heh.

677
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:21,486
Uh, you can talk about
your wife all you want.

678
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:23,855
It's gonna take time to heal.

679
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:25,590
We should just be ourselves.

680
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:29,360
Still, I think I'll keep the
isabelle talk to a minimum.

681
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:30,995
Isabelle?

682
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:32,530
Yeah. That was her name.

683
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:34,766
Where was isabelle from?

684
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:38,169
Virginia. I mean, not too-
-not too far from here, actually.

685
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,877
Caroline!

686
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:47,378
Care, get in the truck.

687
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:54,585
What?

688
00:38:03,462 --> 00:38:05,630
This'll never work.

689
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:18,709
Doin' ok?

690
00:38:22,815 --> 00:38:25,183
Is it weird if I say yes?

691
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,184
Is it true?

692
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:28,486
I should feel more upset

693
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:30,822
Or scared or something, but I...

694
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:32,990
Feel kind of exhilarated.

695
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:35,760
It's the adrenaline.

696
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:37,261
You'll crash soon enough.

697
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:40,031
Yeah, I gus.

698
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:42,333
I fought back tonight.

699
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:43,334
It felt good.

700
00:38:43,402 --> 00:38:45,369
I wish you didn't have to fight at all.

701
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:47,471
Still...

702
00:38:51,844 --> 00:38:53,477
I need to tell you something,

703
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:56,814
And I don't know how
you're gonna feel about it.

704
00:38:58,116 --> 00:38:59,283
What?

705
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:04,222
I told damon that I'd help
him get into that tomb

706
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:05,890
To get katherine back.

707
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,491
But it was a lie.

708
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:10,828
I let him believe that he could trust me.

709
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:15,266
Well, then why would you be
worried about telling me?

710
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:17,101
Because he can be very persuasive,

711
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:20,571
And you two have bonded lately.

712
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,875
hat doesn't mean I trust him.

713
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:28,346
It's gonna take a lot more than
just a road trip and a rescue

714
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:32,083
For me to forget who damon
is and everytng he's done.

715
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:35,553
I don't wanna be his enemy, elena,

716
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:37,889
But I can't let him do it.

717
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:39,190
Then don't,

718
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:42,193
And I'll help you, whatever it takes.

719
00:39:43,629 --> 00:39:45,196
Ok?

720
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:47,965
Ok.

721
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:51,402
Come here.

722
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:26,404
Don't sneak up on me.

723
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:29,040
You love it.

724
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:32,677
Where's noah?

725
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:34,378
His obsession got the best of him,

726
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:35,813
And so did the salvatore brothers.

727
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:37,181
They killed him?

728
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:38,449
Tortured and staked.

729
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:40,217
You're not very upset.

730
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:41,552
I warned him, ben,

731
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,587
And he was just gonna
screw everythingp anyway.

732
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:45,890
Let's be honest. He wasn't exactlan asset.

733
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,492
How'd you do?

734
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,494
Oh, the witch is totally crushing on me.

735
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:52,496
Did you get the journal?

736
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:56,767
No, but I know where it is, and I'll get it.

Stefan: For over a century,
I have lived in secret,

3
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:07,269
Until now. I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

4
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:09,037
Damon: Elena, she's a
dead ringer for katherine.

5
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,973
Our love for katherine wasn't real, damon.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,141
I'm gonna bring her back.

7
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,509
I'm anna. Uh, jeremy.

8
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:15,544
You know, my great-grandfather actually showed me

9
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:17,079
A journal. He had written all of this

10
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:18,147
Creepy stuff about vampires.

11
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:19,148
Your turn

12
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:20,516
Any sad relationship stories?

00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,519
Fell in love, married young...

15
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,390
I've never been in your room before.

16
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,691
Stefan: Elena?

17
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:31,860
Elena: Who am I to you?

18
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:32,961
You are not katherine.

19
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:34,196
Why do I look like her?

20
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:36,165
You were adopted.

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,500

Aah! How you doin' in there?

24
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:54,082
Stefan, who was that man in the road?

25
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,420
I don't know. Do you remember
anything else about him?

26
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:02,424
I wish. I never really saw his face.

27
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:04,092
He was wearing a hoodie.

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,864
All I can remember is that there was
these black boots coming towards me.

29
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:11,600
I brought some vervain

30
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:14,169
For, um-- for you and jenna.

31
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:17,439
And, um, I made this bracelet for jeremy,

32
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:19,107
Few extra on for friends.

33
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,143
You can put it in jewelry,

34
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:24,179
Or you can even put it in food or drink,

35
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:27,583
But as long as it's in you or on you,

36
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,585
A vampire cannot control you.

37
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:31,420
Wow. So much to remember.

38
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:34,756
I know, but there's another vampire in town

39
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:38,293
So until we find out who
it is and what he wants,

40
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:39,795
We have to be careful.

41
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:51,607
Hey.

42
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:54,610
It's gonna be $22.

43
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,345
Elena, I need the money!

44
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:59,414
Uh, here. Come in. Just put it on the table.

45
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:07,856
Hi.

46
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:11,093
Um, keep the change.

47
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:13,829
Thanks.

48
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:16,064

What are you lookin' for, damon?

53
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,221
Not your concern.

54
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:42,190
No, but putting elena in harm's way,

55
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:43,825
That is my concern. Heh heh.

56
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:45,360
What are you talking about?

57
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:46,862
I'm talking about atlanta.

58
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:50,098
Oh, yeah. Elena and I had blast.

59
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:52,934
I get it.

60
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,403
You're just bitter because one of us

61
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,204
Gets to be with the person that we love,

62
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:59,574
And poor katherine is just out of reach.

63
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:01,877
Unless there's another way for
you to get into that tomb.

64
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:03,412
Is that what bree said?

65
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,646
You're pathetic when you're fishing.

66
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:06,715
You're transparent when you're deflecting.

67
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:09,718
Don't you have school?

68
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,229
Surprised? It's a good essay.

69
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:24,132
Your thoughts are clear,
and your argument is well laid out.

70
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,967
It's just, uh, you don't actually

71
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:29,004
Think there are vampires in mystic falls.

72
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,773
No. I mean, I think
statistically there's been

73
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,409
More animal attacks, mystious deaths, uh,

74
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:36,878
People gone missing,
more than any other place

75
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:38,347
In the whole commonwealth of virginia.

76
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,482
It's conjecture,

77
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,418
But creative, which is why you got the "a."

78
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:45,354
I just wouldn't get too, uh, caught up

79
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:47,189
In the whole conspiracy theory of it all.

80
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:48,423
Ah, I won't.

81
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,424
All right.

82
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,727
Oh, uh, jeremy,

83
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:53,395
The source that you cited

84
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:57,065
For the 1860s info, uh, jonathan gilbert...

85
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,100
Uh, my ancestor's journal?

86
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,535
I'd really like to see that sometime.

87
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:01,503
Really?

88
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:02,571
A first-person account

89
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:04,940
Of the civil war? That's like, uh,

90
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,708
Porn for a history teacher.

91
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:08,777
You think my essay's creative,

92
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:11,513
Wait till you get a load of this thing.

93
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:14,883
Thank you.

94
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,193
It's so pretty.

95
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:26,495
Thank you.

96
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:28,797
God, it'll go with, like, everything.

97
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,265
What's the occasion?

98
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,300
No occasion. Just a little friend gift.

99
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:33,235
Lesbian friend necklace?

100
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:35,070
'cause we're freaky like that?

101
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,038
Your friendship is important to me.

102
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:39,474
Why are you being so mushy?

103
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,077
Because you've been avoiding me,

104
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:43,578
And I wanted you to know that whatever

105
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:46,381
Is going on with you and matt, it's ok.

106
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:50,552
I was gonna talk to you about that.

107
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,653
I was,

108
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:54,222
But there's just not much to say.

109
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,258
We've hung out a couple times.

110
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:59,261
That's it, but...

111
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:02,898
I just feel like we've spoken(?) as friends.

112
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,400
This is weird.

113
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:07,235
I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

114
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:08,937
It's weird. It's weird, right?

115
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,305
It's a little weird, but--heh.

116
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:13,608
If it's what you and matt want,
then it's not about me.

117
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,211
But it's all about you.

118
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:19,414
Matt's not over you, and we all know it.

119
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:20,749
I'm with stefan now.

120
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:21,750
Matt understands that.

121
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:23,785
He knows he has to move on.

122
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,357
[music playing]

123
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:32,828
Matt donovan. What do you know?

124
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:34,563
Ben mckittrick. What's up, man?

125
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,897
Rough season, bud.

126
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:37,632
Yeah. It's kind of hard to recover

127
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,468
When you have to forfeit half your games.

128
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:41,736
You gonna be workin' here?

129
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:44,105
Yep, followin' in your footsteps,

130
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:46,775
Minus the late championship.

131
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:48,543
Well, can't all be football gods.

132
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:49,478
Yeah.

133
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:52,080
So what's the plan? Cook line?

134
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:54,416
Busboy.

135
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,589
Bonnie: I can't believe you're adopted.

136
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,858
I never saw that coming.
And it gets weirder.

137
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,226
I looked at my birth certificate.

138
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:06,561
It lists miranda and grayson
gilbert as my birthparents.

139
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:07,929
None oit makes any sense.

140
00:06:07,997 --> 00:06:09,264
Which is why you should ask jenna.

141
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:10,265
[groans]

142
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,200
First of all, the elena I know

143
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,569
Would always want the
real truth, good or bad.

144
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,037
And second of all?

145
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:18,773
You just found out your
boyfriend is a vampire,

146
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:21,943
So unless your birthparents are aliens...

147
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:23,545
How bad could it be?

148
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:26,882
Ah, ok, look, I have to go to the store.

149
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,484
My outfit for the dance is
severely lacking accessories.

150
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:31,386
Ok, I'll pay the bill.

151
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:32,487
Ok. Bye.

152
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:33,989
Bye.

153
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,326
What do you want from me?

154
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:40,595
I think we need a fresh start.

155
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:41,863
You tried to kill me.

156
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:44,733
But I didn't, and if I wanted to,
I would have.

157
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,268
Does that not count for anything?

158
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:48,537
You know, I can start fires with my mind.

159
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:49,804
Fires kill vampires, right?

160
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,009
Just stay the hell away from me.

161
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:56,411
Ben: Everything ok over here?

162
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,246
Yeah, we're fine.

163
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:00,949
I wasn't talkin' to you.

164
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:09,491
Heh.

165
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:13,595
Thank you.

166
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,597
Ytime, bonnie.

167
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:17,566
Wait. Yoremember me?

168
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,701
I didn't graduate thatong ago.

169
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:21,436
You're makin' me feel old.

170
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:22,904
Sorry. I didn't--

171
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:27,442
I didn't mean that.
I just-- I didn't know you knew me.

172
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,912
I always know a pretty face.

175
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,525
Hello.

176
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,492
[male] hello, elena.

177
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,861
Hey, who's this?

178
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,997
You hit me with your car.

179
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,733
Is that a new one?

180
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:56,538
You got away from me.

181
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,206
You won't next time.

182
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,172
Why me? What does he want with me,

183
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,740
A-and if he's trying to kill me,

184
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:12,707
Then why call first?

185
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:14,910
That's because we're predators, ena.

186
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:16,144
We hunt. We stalk.

187
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,814
It's often as exciting as the kill.

188
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,350
I want you to take this.

189
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:25,687
This is jeremy's pocket watch.

190
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,788
How did you get it?

191
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,456
I took it from damon,
who took it from logan,

192
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:29,591
Who must have taken it from you.

193
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,259
What happened to it?

194
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,361
Well, it's n just a watch.

195
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,864
It's a-- it's a sort of compass,

196
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,034
But it points to vampires.

00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,945
Why did my father have it?

201
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,613
Gilberts were one of the founding families,

202
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:54,382
And back in 1864, th were among those

203
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,785
Who sought to eradicate the vampires.

204
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:59,487
The compass was used to find us.

205
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,657
Did you know them?

206
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,460
Yes.

207
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,396
I want you to keep this.

208
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,932
That way, you'll know if
you're ever in danger.

209
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:23,478
I've nevereen you such a mess.

210

[scoffs] don't talk smack.

211
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:29,417
I mean, I just thought that you
told everyone else what to do.

212
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,486
Well, I do that, too,

213
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:33,588
But if you want something done right,

214
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,724
You gotta do it yourself.

215
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,131
You know, I just like
that we're hanging out.

216
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,466
Who knew--you and me?

217
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,468
Well, who knew yocould be fun?

218
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,039

this dumb dance, anyway?

219
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:53,208

00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,976
Uh, I'm not goin'.

Since when are you a busboy?

224
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,486
It's a job.

225
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:07,522
You know, some of us have to work, caroline.

226
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,558
With our mom in and out,
things are tight, so...

227
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,060
I didn't mean it like that.

228
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,829
I just meant that I
didn't know you had a job.

229
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,798
Well, I do.

230
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,367

233
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:27,842
How'd it go?

234
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,010
What?

235
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:30,312
The paper.

236
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,513
Oh. I got an "a."

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,114
Thanks for the artles. They really helped.

238
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,817
Cool. So what'd he say about the vampir?

239
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,952
Did he believe it?

240
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,721
I don't even believe it.
It's just a paper, anna.

241
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,489
Anyways, I, uh-- I gotta get goin'.

242
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,992
Uh, hey, um...

243
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,561
D-do you wanna do something later, maybe?

244
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:49,931
Uh, sorry. I'm stuck on punch
duty at the school dance.

245
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,866
Oh. How'd you get stuck with that?

246
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,502
Well, I'm failin' english,
so I copped a plea.

247
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,107
Maybe, you know, tomorrow or something.

248
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,912
I'm being pushy again, aren't I?

249
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,247
Heh.

250
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,450
Well, thanks for the help. I'll--

251
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,218
I'll see you around.

252
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:20,161
Spoke to the insurance company.

253
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:22,130
Car's totaled.

254
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,266
You can keep using mine for now.

255
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,901
So you're coming to the dance?

256
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:30,772
Alaric askede to help chaperone.

257
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,913
Why didn't you tell me, jenna?

258
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,984
Your mom was gonna do it eventually.

259
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,053
I never thought I'd have to.

260
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,155
If my mom were here right now

261
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:50,225
And I asked, she'd tell me the truth.

262
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:57,732
Your dad was about to
leave the office one night

263
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,235
When this girl showed up.

264
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:04,939
She was 16, a runaway,
and about to give birth.

265
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:09,844
He delivered her baby,
and he gave her a place to stay,

266
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,347
But a few days later, she disappeared.

267
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,884
And there you were.

268
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:19,087
Your parents were trying
so hard to have a baby.

269
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,688
I-it just wasn'tappening.

270
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:25,126
All miranda ever wanted was to be a mom.

271
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:28,963
Well, why were my parents'
names on the birth certicate?

272
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,632
Your dad was a doctor, elena.

273
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,000
He took care of it.

274
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:35,570
They didn't wanna lose you,
so they kept it quiet,

275
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:37,372
Told as fepeople as possible,

276
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,275
But if anyone ever wanted proof,
they had documtation.

277
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,012
What else do you know about her?

278
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,113
The girl.

279
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,915
Just her name.

280
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:49,217
Isabelle.

281
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,626
[door closes]

282
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:03,665
You got the hair right.

283
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,103
Why are you bringing me dad's journa

284
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,171
'cause you were looking for it.

285
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,506
D why would I want it?

286
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,241
Gee, I don't know, damon.

287
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:16,644
Maybe you wanna do a little
bit of posthumous bonding.

288
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,547
Go ahead. Enjoy it. Read it.

289
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:23,651
I have. Nowhere in it does it
say anything about katherine

290
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,487
Or the tomb or how to open it.

291
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,554
I'm not surprised.

292
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,723
Man could rely spell his own name.

293
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,724
I'm really sorry

294
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,426
That it won't be of any help with

295
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:35,163
Your diabolical plan, the sequel.

296
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:38,833
You know, I could help you.

297
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,636
You, help me?

298
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:43,204
Aw, I don't know.

299
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:44,939
Seems a little unnatural.

300
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:48,943
I'll do anythingo get you out of this town,

301
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:49,944
Even release katherine.

302
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,379
What about the other 26 vampires?

303
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,081
No, no, no. They can't come.

304
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:55,450
They have to stay put, but katherine,

305
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,051
I would consider that.

306
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,421
What are you doin'? Hmm?

307
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,123
What's your angle?

308
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:04,592
Think about it.

309
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,631
Why would I trust you?

310
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:11,399
See that's your problem, damon.

311
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,968
You apply all of your
shortcomings to everybody else.

312
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:16,704
If history's any indication,

313
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,474
There's only one liar among us.

314
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:38,927

[compass whirring]

316
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,522
Hey,enna.

317
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,458
Jenna?

318
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,126
Jeremy?

319

324
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,588
Stefan's phone. How mai help you?

325
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:41,522
Where is he?

326
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,624
He's on his way to you,

327
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,092
Forgotis phone.

328
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,462
[sighs] thank god.
This compass was spinning.

329
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,064
Stefan must be here. Thank you.

330
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,599
You're welcome.

331
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,170
[gasps] aah!

332
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,180
Are you ok?

333
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,016
Are you ok?

334
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,917
Ok.

335
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,285
How did he get in?

336
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:18,054
He was invited in.

337
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:21,157
He posed as a pizza delivery guy last night.

338
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:22,725
Well, he gets points fothat.

339
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:24,293
Did he say what he wanted?

340
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:26,696
No. He was too busy trying to kill me.

341
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:28,831
And you have no idea who this is?

342
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,366
No.

343
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:32,702
Don't look at me like that.

344
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,003
I told you we had company.

345
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:35,772
You think there's more than one?

346
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,540
We don't know.

347
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:43,212
Damon, he was invited in.

348
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,684
Then we go get him tonight.

349
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:50,019
You up for it?

350
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,888
What do I have to do?

351
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:53,956
Let your boyfriend take you to the dance.

352
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:55,291
Wel see who shows up.

353
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,160
That's a bad idea.

354
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:58,895
Till we get him, this house isn't safe.

355
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:01,597
For anyone who lives in it.

356
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,201
It's worth a shot.

357
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,904
I'll do it.

358
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:17,346
I'll be with the o of you. I'll be safe.

359
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,186
[music playing]

360
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:51,681
Alaric.

361
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:55,151
Hey, look at you.

362
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,820
I figured I'd stand out
less if I dressed up.

363
00:17:57,888 --> 00:17:59,188
Heh heh. Liar.

364
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:01,457
Ok, I'm a sucker for the decade dance.

365
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,326
I went to school here, you know.

366
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:05,928
They do the sixts and seventies, too, fyi.

367
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:08,064
Oh. Can't wait.

368
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,066
Can I get you a drink?

369
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,635
I hear the punch is real boss.

370
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:14,103
Heh.

371
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,776
Having fun?

372
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:24,547
No, but this took about 2 hours,

373
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:27,216
So I'm at least staying half of that.

374
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:29,218
What's damon doing here?

375
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:34,423
He wanted to come.

376
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:36,592
I promise. He'll behave.

377
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,194
So what is this, like, a threesome now,

378
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:39,428
You and the salvatore brothers?

379
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,531
No, but if I'm gonna be with stefan,

380
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,399
Then I have to learn to tolerate damon.

381
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,067
It's not like I can kill him.

382
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:46,135
There's a thought.

383
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,970
Mmm. I'll help.

384
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:52,408
Jenna: I'm really starting
to see a change in jeremy.

385
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:53,409
Finally.

386
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:55,745
Uh, losing someone you love so suddenly,

387
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:58,080
The, uh--the trauma and the grief ther

388
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:01,651
Are some of the tougher
things 'll face in life.

389
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:05,221
From someone who knows.

390
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:07,156
You have no idea what happened?

391
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:10,326
That's the hard part, not knowing.

392
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,562
Is it ok to talk about your wife?

393
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,131
Heh. There's not much to talk about.

394
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:19,068
Th must be impossible to deal with,
not having any answers.

395
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:23,906
I'd be lying to you if I told you
it didn't keep me up at night.

396
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:26,576
Wondering why, by who,

397
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:29,378
Maybe one day.

398
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:31,747
Hope so.

399
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,285
Hope so.

400
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:47,263
Hi, bonnie.

401
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:49,465
Wanna dance?

402
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,567
I'm out of here.

403
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,803
Please give me another chance.

404
00:19:56,273 --> 00:19:57,807
Back off, damon.

405
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:02,378
Where did ey go?

406
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:04,180
I don't know.

407
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,915
What'd you say to 'em?

408
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:07,850
I was perfectly polite.

409
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:09,619
Elena...

410
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:12,421
Would you like to dance?

411
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:14,256
I would love to.

412
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,959
May I have is dance?

413
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,544
Shouldn't u guys be able to
sense each other or something?

414
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:58,946
No. Doesn't work that way.

415
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:00,614
See him anywhere?

416
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:02,850
Not unless he has a pompadour.

417
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:06,053
Heh. Wow. Was not one of
the better fashion trends.

418
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:09,022
Come on. I'm sure you
looked great back then.

419
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,023
Are there pictures?

420
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:12,493
No. Burned. Buried.

421
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,629
Seriously, what was it like, the fifties?

422
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:18,699
'cause in my mind,
I have this picture of somewhere

423
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,134
Between "american bandstand," "grease."

424
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,736
It's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes.

425
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:26,573
Well, that and, you know, mccarthyism

426
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,575
And segregation and nuclear arms race.

427
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:30,577
Ok, but there were poodle skirts.

428
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:33,180
There were poodle skirts.

429
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:37,384
You're so teaching me
how to do the hand jive.

430
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:38,852
No. That's not gonna happen.

wait for a guy to come up to you.

asking me out on a date?

Vampire: No.

621

What do we--how are you
gonna find the others now?

625

He had to die.

626
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:06,756
But...

627
00:33:06,824 --> 00:33:10,927
Elena, he's been inted in.

[clears throat] y.

631

What were you doing?

632
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:35,686
Looking for ms. Hilden.

633
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:37,822
Why are you in mystic falls?

634
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:39,123
I got a job as a teacher.

635
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:41,125
Do you know what I am?
You're my student's brother.

636
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:43,027
Is everything you're telling me the truth?

637
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:44,028
Yes.

638
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:46,731

00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:09,427
You are.

642
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:12,430
So the grimoire...

643
00:34:12,498 --> 00:34:14,165
That was emily's, right?

644
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:16,935
That's what you need to reverse the spell.

645
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:19,470
When the founding families burned her,
they took her things,

646
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:22,373
And you were hoping that dad's
journal would tell you where it is.

647
00:34:23,442 --> 00:34:26,444
Look at u puttin' the pieces together.

648
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:28,613
Good for you.

649
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:30,248
I was half-right.

650
00:34:30,316 --> 00:34:32,216
Well, it's out there now.

651
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:34,986
Let the games begin.

652
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:37,088
My offer still stands.

653
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:39,457
Yeah, with some hidden caveats, no dou.

654
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,326
No. Nothing hidden about it.

655
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:42,527
No lies. No deception.

656
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:45,163
I'm there when you open up that tomb,

657
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,699
You and katherine go,

658
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:49,567
And the other 26 vampires die.

659
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:51,803
If I agree I'll help you.

660
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,905
Why should I trust you?
Because I'm your brother.

661
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:55,340
No, that's not gonna cut it.

662
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:57,175
Because I want you gone.

663
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,584
Ok.

664
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:10,722
[music playing]

665
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:13,925
Looki said something stupid.

666
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:17,762
I'm sorry, but I wasn't
even taing about you.

667
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,831
Yes, you were, caroline.

668
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:22,200
Ben could easily be .

669
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:23,134
We're just alike.

670
00:35:23,202 --> 00:35:24,235
That's not true.

671
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:26,204
Are you seriouy mad about this?

672
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,906
Matt, you know me.

673
00:35:28,974 --> 00:35:31,042
Ok, I say stupid things without thinking,

674
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,245
And then I have to apologize
and take it back, and...

675
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:37,582
I'm a terrible, awful person,
but I'm rking on it.

676
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,418
Look, can we just not do this right now?

677
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:42,720
Ok.

678
00:35:42,788 --> 00:35:44,922
When do you get off?

679
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:46,891
Look, this thing we've got,

680
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,726
It's nice, and it feels really good,

681
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:50,828
And I know you wna take the next step.

682
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:51,996
How do you know that?

683
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:53,364
Have you even asked me?

684
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:56,868
I'm--I'm not over elena.

685
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:02,073
I mean, I don't know if I am,
but if we go there,

686
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:05,209
Then it could mess things up,
and we might lose this,

687
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:08,546
And this is the only good thi
I've got going for me right now.

688
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:10,815
So if it doesn't work,
I'll just disappoint you

689
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:13,317
And hurt you, and I don't wanna do that.

690
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,089
Well, big problem, matt,

691
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:21,092
Because you took the next
step all by yourself,

692
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,294
And you played the whole
thing out in your head,

693
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:26,097
And you decided to bail
before even giving it a shot.

694
00:36:26,165 --> 00:36:28,733
So this really great thing that we have,

695
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,635
Don't worry about losing it,

696
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:32,670
'cause it's already gone.

697
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:41,813
Thank you.

698
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
I needed that.

699
00:36:42,948 --> 00:36:44,549
Well, thank you for--for coming.

700
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:45,883
I--I really appreciate it.

701
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:48,086
You made the evening much more...

702
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:52,590
Well, you made it, period.

703
00:36:52,658 --> 00:36:53,958
I'm glad I could help.

704
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:57,061
And thank you for puttinup
with all that wife talk.

705
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:58,496
I--I gotta stop doin' that.

706
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:01,199
It doesn't bode well for dating.

707
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:04,802
Is that what this was, a date?

708
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,337
No, definitely not a date.

709
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:07,338
Oh.

710
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:08,506
But Friday...

711
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:11,542
You, me, and dinner and a movie,

712
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,444
That could be a date.

713
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:15,813
How 'bout it?

714
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:17,115
Works for me.

715
00:37:17,182 --> 00:37:18,316
Heh.

716
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:21,486
Uh, you can talk about
your wife all you want.

717
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:23,855
It's gonna take time to heal.

718
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:25,590
We should just be ourselves.

719
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:29,360
Still, I think I'll keep the
isabelle talk to a minimum.

720
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:30,995
Isabelle?

721
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:32,530
Yeah. That was her name.

722
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:34,766
Where was isabelle from?

723
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:38,169
Virginia. I mean, not too-
-not too far from here, actually.

724
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,877
Caroline!

725
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:47,378
Care, get in the truck.

726
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:54,585
What?

727
00:38:03,462 --> 00:38:05,630
This'll never work.

728
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:18,709
Doin' ok?

729
00:38:22,815 --> 00:38:25,183
Is it weird if I say yes?

730
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,184
Is it true?

731
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:28,486
I should feel more upset

732
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:30,822
Or scared or something, but I...

733
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:32,990
Feel kind of exhilarated.

734
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:35,760
It's the adrenaline.

735
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:37,261
You'll crash soon enough.

736
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:40,031
Yeah, I gus.

737
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:42,333
I fought back tonight.

738
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:43,334
It felt good.

739
00:38:43,402 --> 00:38:45,369
I wish you didn't have to fight at all.

740
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:47,471
Still...

741
00:38:51,844 --> 00:38:53,477
I need to tell you something,

742
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:56,814
And I don't know how
you're gonna feel about it.

743
00:38:58,116 --> 00:38:59,283
What?

744
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:04,222
I told damon that I'd help
him get into that tomb

745
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:05,890
To get katherine back.

746
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,491
But it was a lie.

747
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:10,828
I let him believe that he could trust me.

748
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:15,266
Well, then why would you be
worried about telling me?

749
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:17,101
Because he can be very persuasive,

750
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:20,571
And you two have bonded lately.

751
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,875
[scoffs]hat doesn't mean I trust him.

752
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:28,346
It's gonna take a lot more than
just a road trip and a rescue

753
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:32,083
For me to forget who damon
is and everytng he's done.

754
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:35,553
I don't wanna be his enemy, elena,

755
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:37,889
But I can't let him do it.

756
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:39,190
Then don't,

757
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:42,193
And I'll help you, whatever it takes.

758
00:39:43,629 --> 00:39:45,196
Ok?

759
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:47,965
Ok.

760
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:51,402
Come here.

761
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:26,404
Don't sneak up on me.

762
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:29,040
You love it.

763
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:32,677
Where's noah?

764
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:34,378
His obsession got the best of him,

765
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:35,813
And so did the salvatore brothers.

766
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:37,181
They killed him?

767
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:38,449
Tortured and staked.

768
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:40,217
You're not very upset.

769
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:41,552
I warned him, ben,

770
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,587
And he was just gonna
screw everythingp anyway.

771
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:45,890
Let's be honest. He wasn't exactlan asset.

772
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,492
How'd you do?

773
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,494
Oh, the witch is totally crushing on me.

774
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:52,496
Did you get the journal?

775
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:56,767
No, but I know where it is, and I'll get it.

wasn't real, Damon.

Katherine never compelled
me. I knew everything.

Can I borrow
your ancestor's journal?

16
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,560
I gave it to

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,680
So the Grimoire,
that as Emily's, right?

19
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,360
That's what you need
to reverse the spell?

20
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,200
- I'll help you.
- Ok.

21
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
I told Damon that I'd help
him get Katherine back.

22
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,520
But it was a lie.
I can't let him do it.

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,920
Then don't. And I'll help
you. Whatever it takes.

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,720
Please!

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,200
Please, help us!

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
Please, my husband,
he's been hurt!

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,840
Please help him!

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,160
What are you doing out her
in the middle of the night?

29
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,360
It's not safe.

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
No. No, sir.

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
It's not safe.

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,160
And that's how
it's done.

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
What happens
to the bodies?

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,800
Well, I'll take them
into the woods

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,960
And the other animals
will finish them off.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,520
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm ready.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
I want you
to turn me.

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,880
When it's time.

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,320
Kiss me.

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,880
You should get a taste.

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,600
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,120
Soon you won't be able
to get enough.

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,160
Mmm.

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,000
Mmm, good morning.

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,400
I could get used
to this.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,840
Rise and shine,
sleepyheads.

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,760
- Damon! Please!
- What are you doing?

50
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,040
Oh, stop being smutty.

51
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,240
Seriously,
get out of here!

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,680
If I see something
I haven't seen before,

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
I'll throw a dollar at it.
Now listen,

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,080
We have some very important
business to discuss.

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,360
And it has to be
right now?

56
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
Well, we have lots to do,
now that we're all friends

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,280
and working toward
a common goal.

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
So, in order
to open the tomb,

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,960
We need to find the journal

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,720
to get the Grimoire
to open the spells.

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
First things first-
since you are Elena Gilbert,

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
you're on journal duty.

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
Since when
am I helping?

64
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
Well, Stefan's helping,
and you've taken up residence

65
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,560
in Stefan's bed, ergo...

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,720
- I'll look for it tonight.
- Good.

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,320
How do we know
that this journal

69
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,000
will hold the location
of the Grimoire?

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,800
We're really going to take
the word of this vampire?

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,520
In lieu of any other options.

72
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,360
Ok, what exactly is
a Grimoire, anyway?

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
It's a witch's cookbook.

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,760
Every spell
that a witch casts

75
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,200
is unique unto itself,

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,040
so every witch
would document their work.

77
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,800
Yeah. Cookbook.

78
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,000
What about our
mystery vampire?

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,880
Dimwit obviously
wasn't working alone,

80
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,920
So whoever's out there
knows who we are.

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
And I don't like that
disadvantage, so...

82
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,560
Chop, chop.

83
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,400
You know, I really like this whole
mnage-threesome team thing.

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
It's got a bit
of a kink to it.

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Don't screw it up.

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,440
He does have-

87
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,640
Oh, right, yeah.

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,560
Ok.

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh! No, come here.

90
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,000
- We shouldn't...
- Shh.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
What are you doing?
Stop it!

92
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,760
Make me.

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,720
Yes?

94
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,960
Excuse me, miss Katherine.

95
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
Miss Pearl
is here to see you.

96
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll be down soon.

97
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,080
Please ask her to wait.

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,920
Thank you, Emily.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
- Fun's over.
- Hmm, no.

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
It's good
to see you, Pearl.

101
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,280
Perhaps we could
talk outside.

102
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,520
Emily, would you please
tell Mr. Salvatore

103
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
That I've stepped away?

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,280
Which one?

105
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,240
Both.

106
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,280
How long do you plan on
staying with the Salvatores?

107
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,520
People talk,
Katherine.

108
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
You, carrying on
with both brothers,

109
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
doesn't help
the situation.

110
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,640
The salvatores have been
kind to take me in.

111
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,320
As far as everyone here knows,

112
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm a poor orphan girl
from Atlanta,

113
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
lost her family
in the fires.

114
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,480
A match you lit,
no doubt.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
Honey, please
be careful.

116
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,520
Honorary Fell came by
the apothecary yesterday

117
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
With a case
of this elixir.

118
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,560
She asked that it be
sold at a reduced rate.

119
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,640
- I don't follow.
- Try it.

120
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,680
- What in hell?
- Vervain.

121
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
Why is there-

122
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,360
They know.

123
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,600
They're trying to find us, and
they're getting crafty about it.

124
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,360
The townspeople
ingesting vervain?

125
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,080
Well, that's inconvenient.

126
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,320
It might be time for us
to move on again.

127
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,800
No. I like it here.

128
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,560
I'm not interested
in leaving just yet.

129
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,240
Can we go, mama?

130
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Is something wrong?

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,640
Hey, it's me again.

132
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,240
Anna.
Soccer chick

133
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,160
and foosball
champion.

134
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,560
I'll be at the grill
later, if you want,

135
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,280
you know, a
rematch, or whatever.

136
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,760
Who are you calling?

137
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,080
Jeremy Gilbert.

138
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,760
You're not, like,
into him, are you?

139
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,240
I need him for
something. Get over it.

140
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Oh! Mmm!

141
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,200
Damn it!

142
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,520
Dude, you gotta stop
doing that.

143
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,360
I know. I just-
I keep forgetting.

144
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,040
You're new.

145
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,800
You'll get it.

146
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,080
You found
the Gilbert journal?

147
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,480
Does that look like
the Gilbert journal?

148
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,280
Well, it's old and musty,

149
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,880
and how am I supposed
to know the difference?

150
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,440
I don't know, I figured
maybe, just maybe,

151
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,000
you've been paying a little
bit of attention since we met.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,800
You know, you don't
have to talk down to me.

153
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,600
I'm not stupid.

154
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,080
Here.

155
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,360
Drink.

156
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
I don't want you getting
itchy around the witch.

157
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,920
She can sense
if you're weak.

158
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,520
When can we
go hunting again?

159
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,840
This tastes old.
I want fresh blood.

160
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,280
When we get that tomb open,

161
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,480
you can kill
anyone you want.

162
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,160
For now,
just stay focused on Bonnie

163
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,040
while I try to get the journal
back from Jeremy's teacher.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Why did you choose me?

165
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,640
I needed someone in a position
to be my eyes and ears.

166
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,880
Small town bartender
fit the bill

167
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,200
There are plenty of
bartenders to choose from.

168
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,120
Why me?

169
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,040
You were sad then.

170
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,400
You lacked purpose.

171
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,320
You needed me.

172
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,080
Do you think Damon
really believes us?

173
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,920
That we're both
trying to help him?

174
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,680
I don't think Damon
knows what to believe.

175
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,200
Trust isn't something
that comes naturally to him.

176
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,680
You know...

177
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,120
I rely think
that Damon believes

178
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,280
that everything he's done,
every move that he's made,

179
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,960
he's done for love.

180
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,840
It's twisted,
but kind of sad.

181
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,000
There are other ways
to get what you want.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,080
You don't have
to kill people.

183
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,360
Damon has no regard
for human life.

184
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,120
He enjoys inflicting
pain on others.

185
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,520
For 145 years,

186
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,960
Every single time that I
have let my guard down

187
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,600
And let Damon
back into my life,

188
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,280
He's done something
to make me regret that.

189
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,080
I'm not going to make
that mistake again.

190
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,680
So what do you think
will happen

191
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,480
if the tomb gets opened
and Damon gets Katherine back?

192
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,800
I think that no matter
what Damon promises,

193
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
A lot of people
will die.

194
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,080
That's Jonathan Gilbert.

195
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
What's this?

196
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,720
What are you guys doing?

197
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,000
Hey. Just going
through some stuff,

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,640
feeling sentimental.

199
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,680
Dad had this whole family
journal from years ago.

200
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,800
I thought
I'd dig it up.

201
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,080
Jonathan Gilbert's journal?

202
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,600
Yeah, what do you
know about it?

203
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,080
I just did
a history report on it.

204
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,600
Oh. So where is it now?

205
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,760
I gave it to Mr. Saltzman.
He wanted to see it.

206
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,080
<i>I met Barnett and
Giuseppe this evening.</i>

207
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,720
<i>I saw the skepticism in their eyes
when I showed them the compass.</i>

208
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,960
We're supposed to believe
that can track one of them?

209
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,640
What is it, magic?

210
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,680
It's science.

211
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,080
I'll believe it
when I see it.

212
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
I've been thinking
about this church idea.

213
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,120
I believe
it could work.

214
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,800
Excuse me, father.

215
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
I didn't know
you had guests.

216
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,840
We'll be done
in a few minutes, son.

217
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,960
I'll come back.
Forgive me, Mr. Gilbert,

218
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,480
Mr. Lockwood.

219
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Have you told them?

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,680
Not yet.

221
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,600
Giuseppe, we need all
the men we can get.

222
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,720
I'll tell them.

223
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,880
You can count
on both my boys.

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,320
Hello?

225
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,760
Hello?

226
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,680
Someone there?

227
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,600
You shouldn't have
done that.

228
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,760
Have a seat.

229
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
What is this,
compressed air?

230
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,880
Did you make it
yourself?

231
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,400
Who are you?

232
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
I'm not going
to hurt you...

233
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,160
unless you
try that again.

234
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,000
Now...

235
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,240
Who are you?

236
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,480
I'm a teacher.

237
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,920
Are we going to have
to do this the hard way?

238
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm also a historian.

239
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,200
And while researching
Virginia, I-

240
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,400
made a few discoveries
about your town.

241
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,080
So you show up
like Van Helsing.

242
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,240
Come on.

243
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,360
Tell me the truth.

244
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,680
My wife
was a parapsychologist.

245
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,200
She spent her life researching
paranormal activity in this area.

246
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,720
It was her work
that led me here.

247
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,160
Where's your wife?

248
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,680
Dead.

249
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,160
A vampire killed her.

250
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,320
Where's
the Gilbert journal?

251
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,000
- What do you want with it?
- Where is it?

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,800
- It's on my desk.
- No, it's not.

253
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,960
It was on my desk.

254
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,200
Anything?

255
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,080
Not yet.
Just a lot of gibberish.

256
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,800
Yeah, some people
just shouldn't journal.

257
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,440
I thought this Gilbert
was the brains.

258
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,160
Don't you have a date?

259
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,360
Yep.

260
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,640
Wish me luck.

261
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,320
Ehh.

262
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,560
<i>I saw her again today-</i>

263
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,640
<i>The most beautiful woman
in town,</i>

264
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,680
<i>With a name just
as pretty, Pearl.</i>

265
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,200
Have you thought any more
of what I've said?

266
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,440
We'll leave soon,
Pearl, I promise.

267
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,680
I need to take care
of a few things first.

268
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,080
You're going to turn
both of them, aren't you?

269
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,040
Katherine, please.

270
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,800
Be careful.

271
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,000
We'll all be safe,
I promise.

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,440
Mr. Gilbert's
coming.

273
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,880
Quick, your cheeks.

274
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,360
Perfectly rosie.

275
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,200
Miss Pearl.

276
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,360
May I have a moment?

277
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,840
Yes Mr. Gilbert.

278
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,680
I'm still
waiting for you

279
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,400
to explain
that comet in the sky.

280
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,080
Your mother
has an admirer.

281
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,840
As descendants of
the founding families,

282
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
they'll want to know that
they can count on you.

283
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,880
Of course they can.

284
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,640
Is there any doubt?

285
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,080
I'm not sure
your bother Damon

286
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,840
understands
the importance of duty.

287
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,440
Damon left the
confederacy on principle.

288
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,640
It was his choice
and should be respected.

289
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,040
You'll forgive me if I have
trouble respecting a deserter.

290
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,400
Well, I never asked
for your respect.

291
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,480
Good for you, Damon.

292
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,640
Because all I have
is disappointment.

293
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,720
You said the town
is in trouble?

294
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,040
There's been too many deaths.

295
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,320
It is time for us
to fight back

296
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,680
and stop these killers.

297
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,160
Killers? What are you
talking about?

298
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,360
We live amongst demons.

299
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,560
You're being cryptic
now, father.

300
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,400
Why don't you just
say the word?

301
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,800
Vampires.

302
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,440
They exist.

303
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,960
And they live amongst us.

304
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,520
But we have
a plan to kill them.

305
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,120
And you're going
to help us.

306
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,440
My father never approved
of anyone I dated,

307
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,160
which only made me
want them more.

308
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,000
Of course.

309
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,920
What about you?

310
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,440
There were
a few guys.

311
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,840
Logan isn't the only
loser I've dated.

312
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,160
They ever find him?
Or is he still missing?

313
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,840
He's not missing.

314
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,000
He's in the Bahamas
working on his tan.

315
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,160
Very entitled,
that one.

316
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,040
Marches
to his own drum.

317
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,880
He's foul.

318
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,040
They're all snooty.

319
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,800
Hello, Elena.

320
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,240
Hey. Where have you been?

321
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,560
We're cooking dinner.

322
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,680
Is Stefan with you?

323
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,440
He'll be here soon.

324
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,200
How long have you been
aware of me?

325
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,560
I learned just recently.

326
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,080
What about your brother?

327
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,920
You met Damon.

328
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,800
Who do you think
killed my wife?

329
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
Are you certain
it was Damon?

330
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,440
I witnessed it.

331
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,800
If you're here
for revenge,

332
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,560
this is going to end
very badly for you.

333
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,080
I just want to find out
what happened to my wife.

334
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,440
I thought you just said
that Damon-

335
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,360
Yeah.

336
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,200
I saw him

337
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,280
draining the life
out of her.

338
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,880
He must have heard me
coming.

339
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,920
He just...Disappeared.

340
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,000
So did her body.

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,800
They never found her

342
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,800
Damon can never know
why you're here.

343
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,320
He'll kill you
without blinking.

344
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,000
I can take care
of myself.

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,400
No,
you can't.

346
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,880
I can help you.

347
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,560
If you let me.

348
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,560
Whoa. Mmm.

349
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,440
Don't do that.

350
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,520
Do what?

351
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,920
You know what.
That move was deliberate.

352
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,200
Well, yeah, I was
deliberately trying

353
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,800
to get to the sink.

354
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Speaking of Stefan,

355
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,920
where is he?

356
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,000
He's missing
family night,

357
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,240
which I am enjoying
immensely.

358
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is it real?

359
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,320
Is what real?

360
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,000
This renewed sense
of brotherhood.

361
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,640
Can I trust him?

362
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,360
Yes, you can trust him.

363
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,200
Can I trust him?

364
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm wearing vervain, Damon.
It's not going to work.

365
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm not
compelling you.

366
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,720
I just want you
to answer me.

367
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,920
Honestly.

368
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,560
Of course you can.

369
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,040
You can
trust me, Mr. Salvatore.

370
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,800
I would never cheat.

371
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,320
I'm losing over here.

372
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,440
Again!

373
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,440
She's good.

374
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,080
I almost believe
she genuinely likes him.

375
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,360
Perhaps she does.

376
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,320
She knows father would have
her killed if he knew the truth.

377
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,680
Not if we talk
to him;

378
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,080
explained how we feel.

379
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,480
He could help us
keep her safe.

380
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,680
Have you gone mad?

381
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,480
No, no, father would
drive the stake in her himself!

382
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,840
That's not true.
We can trust him.

383
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,040
No, no, not with this.

384
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,160
Please, promise me
you won't tell him, Stefan.

385
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,120
I promise.

386
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,280
There was a time when
I trusted him more than anyone.

387
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,880
Trust breeds trust.

388
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,480
You have to give it
to get it.

389
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,520
Are you lecturing me?

390
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,000
Do you need
to be lectured?

391
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,600
I just want her back.

392
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,640
I'm sure you can
understand that.

393
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,600
I can understand that you
would do anything for her, yes.

394
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,000
Then you understand
what I will do

395
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,080
if anyone
gets in my way.

396
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,920
You said you never
played this thing before.

397
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm a fast learner.
Quick reflexes.

398
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,440
Who are you dodging?

399
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,120
This girl Anna.

400
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,280
She can be, uh,
persistent.

401
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,120
Is she hot?

402
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,200
Yeah yeah,
but she can be weird.

403
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,240
Hot trumps weird,
trust me.

404
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,440
He is
ridiculously hot!

405
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,760
Shh!

406
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,320
He's an ass.

407
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,760
What are you doing
with all this stuff?

408
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,560
I thought there
might be something

409
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,560
about my birth
parents.

410
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,680
Have you told
Jeremy?

411
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,440
I will.

412
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,680
When the time is right.

413
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,040
That's Stefan.

414
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,560
Dude!

415
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,760
Well?

416
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,240
Admit it.

417
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,360
I can't sing.

418
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
No. You were great.

419
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,400
Come on, totally trashed
a Metallica song.

420
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,920
Well, first mistake,
Metallica karaoke?

421
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,080
Well, at least
I could admit it.

422
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,360
The woman with
the tattoos loved you.

423
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,720
Yeah, well, next time,

424
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,480
I'm going to throw out
my pearl jam.

425
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,400
Next time?

426
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,080
Yeah.

427
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,560
So, uh,

428
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,920
What are your friends
up to tonight?

429
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,520
They're all doing
their own thing.

430
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,360
Caroline's at her dad's,
Elena's with her boyfriend.

431
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,600
Elena Gilbert, right?

432
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,920
Yeah, I remember.
You guys used to hang out.

433
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,600
She's my best friend.

434
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,720
Yeah, my friends, they all
moved away after graduation,

435
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,000
and I didn't.

436
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,560
So we just kind of
drifted apart.

437
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,080
Oh. Elena and I are
bonded for life.

438
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,160
I can't imagine it
either way.

439
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,760
That tight, huh?

440
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,640
She's my sister.
I mean, I'd die for her.

441
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,960
Huh.

442
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,520
- Who took it?
- I don't know.

443
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,600
You know what,
it's that teacher.

444
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,800
There's something
really off about him.

445
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,920
No, he doesn't know
anything.

446
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,600
Somebody got to him
right before me.

447
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Who else knew it was there?

448
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,000
No. Damon,
leave him out of it!

449
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,200
Why, what's
the big deal?

450
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,320
Damon!

451
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,680
So...

452
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,000
I heard you found
a really cool journal

453
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,840
from back in the day.

454
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,000
- Who else did you show it to?
- Huh?

455
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,480
Don't ask questions,
just spill.

456
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,240
You're kidding me, right?

457
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,760
Jer, did you tell anyone
other than Mr. Saltzman

458
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,360
about Jonathan Gilbert's
journal?

459
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,400
Why is everybody
so obsessed with that thing?

460
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,440
Who else did you tell?

461
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,600
- Just that girl Anna.
- The hot weird one?

462
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,120
- Yeah.
- Wait, who is Anna?

463
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,200
That's what I want
to find out.

464
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,440
How do you know her?

465
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,440
I just know her.

466
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
She wants me to meet her
at the grill tonight.

467
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,080
Perfect. I'll drive.

468
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,000
- Come on.
- Ok.

469
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Ok, I'm alone.

470
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,640
<i>Give me all the deets,
Bonnie. I'm dying.</i>

471
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,000
It's going great.
He's a perfect gentleman.

472
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,840
- Gentleman, huh?
- I know!

473
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,480
Boring, huh? I just want to
grab him and lay one on him.

474
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,440
<i>Why don't you?</i>

475
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,720
'cause I'm a chicken.

476
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,640
You're a
powerful witch goddess.

477
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,880
Come on, seize the day,
Broom Hilda.

478
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,320
Ok.

479
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,080
I'm going to text you later
with more details.

480
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,440
You better.

481
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,800
Where's Damon?

482
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,640
He left to track down
Jeremy's friend Anna,

483
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,000
see if there was
anything there.

484
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,360
Aren't you going
to go with him?

485
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,800
If he gets to the journal
before we do, then...

486
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,560
Doesn't matter.

487
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,840
- What is that?
- It's a copy of it.

488
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,280
How did you get it?

489
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,040
Well, Mr. Saltzman
made a copy

490
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,520
And was kind enough
to loan it to me.

491
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,280
He did?

492
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,000
Not exactly, but I got it.

493
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,480
You just couldn't
live without me, huh

494
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,760
Well, I kinda miss my daily
dose of cute stalker chick.

495
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,040
Oh, funny.

496
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,120
Let's play.

497
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,440
The sheriff
was here earlier.

498
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,880
He bought large volumes
of the vervain elixir.

499
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Did he try to put his hands
on you again?

500
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,440
- Doesn't he always?
- She's saving herself

501
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,880
For Jonathan Gilbert.

502
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm beyond saving.
We know that.

503
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,440
How can you be so calm?

504
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,320
They're getting closer
to you every day.

505
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,040
We are the respectable ladies
of Mystic Falls.

506
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,120
Thanks to Emily, we walk
the streets in daylight.

507
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,720
No one will ever suspect us.

508
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,440
Not unless
a human tells them.

509
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
I'd sooner die.

510
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,400
And soon enough, you will.

511
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,520
Mrs. Fell is approaching.

512
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,960
Thank you,
Annabelle.

513
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,240
Here's a reference that
he wrote about Emily.

514
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,120
"The Fell family
believed it should be I,

515
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
"not them, who protected
the witch's spell book.

516
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,560
But I feared she would
haunt me from the hereafter.

517
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,360
They mocked my fear,
but it was Giuseppe Salvatore who..."

518
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,560
- Is that your father?
- Yeah.

519
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,480
"It was Giuseppe Salvatore
who removed my fear.

520
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,160
"He told me he would protect
the secret of the spell book.

521
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,840
He said he would carry it
to his grave."

522
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
Stefan.

523
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,920
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

524
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,840
Did I interrupt
your writing?

525
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,120
These are the dull musings
of my troubled mind.

526
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,560
A great mind.

527
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,040
Still. I will carry
the real secrets with me-

528
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,800
To your grave.

529
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,960
And a full grave
it will be.

530
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,960
Now, speaking
of troubled minds,

531
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,120
what's on yours?

532
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,200
I have concerns about
your plan for the vampires.

533
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,760
And why is that?

534
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,800
We are making the assumption
that all vampires

535
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,120
are as evil as they've
been characterized,

536
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,800
but what if that's not true?

537
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,400
Do you have any evidence
to the contrary?

538
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,560
Do you know
of any vampires?

539
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,880
No. No, of course not.

540
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,120
But are we to take
what others say

541
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,560
at face value?

542
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,720
You always taught us
so differently.

543
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,080
Stefan...
These creatures

544
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,320
Are of the darkest parts
of hell.

545
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,880
They have the ability
to control your mind,

546
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,200
seduce your spirit.

547
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
They are deadly.

548
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,360
They must be destroyed.

549
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,160
Those who stand
with them;

550
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,440
those who bring shame to their
families will be destroyed as well.

551
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,960
I know where it is.

552
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,120
Ok, I give.

553
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,760
Damn.

554
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,240
You're strong
for a little thing.

555
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,520
I was wondering how long it
would take you to find me.

556
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,120
Why isn't your father
buried in your family's tomb?

557
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,600
It wasn't built
until well after he died.

558
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Are you sure the Grimoire's
in there with him?

559
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,480
As sure
as I could be.

560
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,440
Great.

561
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,000
Elena.

562
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
I can do this
on my own.

563
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,280
And I said I would do
whatever I can to help.

564
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,520
I know, and I appreciate
that, but-

565
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,360
This town is my home, Stefan.

566
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,400
My friends and family
are here. You're here.

567
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,840
I don't want that tomb
opened any more than you do.

568
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,680
I'm sorry that you have
to do this.

569
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,880
What is that?

570
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,160
Gift.

571
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,760
From Damon?

572
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,160
From Emily, actually.

573
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,360
And when will you stop
worrying about Damon?

574
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,520
I want you all
to myself.

575
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,920
Just as he wants me,

576
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,720
but I'm the one who gets
to make all the rules.

577
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,080
And why is that?

578
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
Because I'm spoiled.

579
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
Yes, you are.

580
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,080
- And selfish.
- Mmm.

581
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,720
And because I can do this.

582
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,840
Ahh.

583
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
And this.

584
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,680
And this.

585
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,440
What?

586
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
What?

587
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,160
Vervain.

588
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,320
What?

589
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,560
Katherine!
Katherine!

590
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,320
Go get the sheriff.
Tell him we have a vampire.

591
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,440
What? No!

592
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,040
Do as I say, son!

593
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,440
Nothing that you feel
for her is real.

594
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,080
She's a vampire, Stefan!
A monster!

595
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,400
I fed you vervain hoping
that it would expose her.

596
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,320
How did you know?

597
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,440
Your sympathy
for their plight.

598
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,360
I didn't raise my sons
to be so weak.

599
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,120
The sheriff, now.
Go, quickly!

600
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,200
Now, son!

601
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,040
How long have you been here?

602
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,600
I arrived around
half-past comet,

603
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,280
watching you screw up every
chance you had to open that tomb.

604
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,040
How did you know
about the spell?

605
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,280
I didn't say much
back then,

606
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,440
which means
I heard everything.

607
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,120
So if you've been here
the whole time,

608
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,280
then why are we just
crossing paths right now?

609
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,680
I like to use others
to do my dirty work.

610
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,360
Like Logan Fell?

611
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Oh, yeah, thanks
for that, by the way.

612
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,000
Little bastard shot me.

613
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,240
- Logan was an idiot.
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,160
We slipped him some blood
when he started getting

615
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,000
all poser slayer
with that comps.

616
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,160
I needed his family's journal.
I couldn't let him die.

617
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,280
What'd you want
with the Fell journal?

618
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,120
I thought it contained
the location

619
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,480
of the witch's spell book.

620
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,400
I was wrong.

621
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,240
According to her journal,
Honorea gave the Grimoire

622
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,880
of Jonathan Gilbert.

623
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,600
And, according to this...

624
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,040
He gave it
to your father.

625
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
So now you're going
to help me find it.

626
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,200
Why would I help you?

627
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,920
'cause you and I both
want that tomb open.

628
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,520
Hmm.

629
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,800
Sorry.

630
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,760
I work alone.

631
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,200
Well the check's paid.

632
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,920
I'm all yours tonight.
What do you want to do?

633
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,760
This.

634
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,160
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Sorry.

635
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,440
I just should have waited until
the end of the night to do that.

636
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,720
I didn't mind.

637
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,360
You know,
I'm starting to get tired.

638
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,560
Do you want go?

639
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,400
I was going to say let's
have some more coffee,

640
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,880
get a caffeine buzz,
and, I don't know,

641
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,320
go out,
do something crazy.

642
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,920
Hmm, like what?

643
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,360
Like anything.

644
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,720
Ok. I'm going to
run to the restroom.

645
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,880
- Ok.
- All right.

646
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,040
What?

647
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,840
Not many girls
can say they've done this.

648
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,280
Is that it?

649
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,280
Well,
what do you know?

650
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,600
This is an interesting
turn of events.

651
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,360
I can't let you
bring her back.

652
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,640
I'm sorry.

653
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,360
So am I.

654
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,880
For thinking
for even a second

655
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
that I can
trust you.

656
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,440
Oh. You're not capable
of trust.

657
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
The fact that you're here
means that you read the journal

658
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,360
and you were planning on
doing this yourself.

659
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Of course I was going
to do it by myself,

660
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,680
because the only one
I can count on is me!

661
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,800
You made sure of that
many years ago, Stefan.

662
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,280
But you...

663
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,800
You had me fooled.

664
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,600
So what are you
going to do now?

665
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,320
Because if you try
and destroy that,

666
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,360
I'll rip
her heart out.

667
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,880
You won't kill her.

668
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,720
I can do one better.

669
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,200
Give me the book,
Stefan.

670
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,440
Or I'm stabbing
her neck.

671
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,120
And you and I will have
a vampire girlfriend.

672
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,000
Let her go first.

673
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,640
The Book.

674
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm not going
to give this to you

675
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,480
until she is
standing next to me.

676
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,440
The problem is,
I no longer trust

677
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
that you'll
give it back!

678
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
You just did the one thing
that ensures that I will.

679
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Stop! No
don't take her!

680
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,280
Do you know
what they'll do to you

681
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,640
if you're branded
a sympathizer?

682
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,440
You'll be killed
along with them!

683
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,280
Just let me be killed!

684
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,880
My head supposed
to hurt like this?

685
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,360
Oh, you'll be fine.
That was just

686
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,880
a small amount of blood.

687
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,640
It should pass out of
your system by tomorrow.

688
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,360
Are you ok?

689
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,120
Damon was right.
This is, uh...

690
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,880
This is my fault.

691
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,360
Damon!

692
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,360
Damon! Stop, stop.

693
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,960
I'll help you.

694
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,880
- We'll get her back.
- Help me?!

695
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,120
Don't you think
you've done enough?

696
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,360
You promised
you wouldn't tell him!

697
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,200
I didn't think
this would happen.

698
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,560
You did this.

699
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,880
This is your fault.

700
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,000
<i>I put my faith
in my father,</i>

701
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,920
but Damon
put his faith in me,

702
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,120
and I destroyed that.

703
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,160
This is my fault.

704
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,960
You didn't do
anything wrong.

705
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,840
Don't forget that.

706
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,000
Ok.

707
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm going to get you
that aspirin.

708
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,520
Ok.

709
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,640
You know you're not
staying the night, right?

710
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,640
We're just going
to hang out

711
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,640
- for a little while.
- You're lucky I like you.

712
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,400
Keep the door open.

713
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,000
You got it.

714
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,760
Hey, do you have any aspirin?

715
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,360
Yeah.

716
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,760
Oh, hey, Stefan.

717
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,240
Where'd she go?

718
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
- She went to the bathroom.
- Where'd who go?

719
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,240
- He has a friend over.
- Anna.

720
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,320
What's happening?

721
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,760
Get Emily.

722
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,440
Stay hidden.

723
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,280
I'll get us out of here.

724
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,880
- Pearl!
- Jonathan!

725
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Do you see all this?

726
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,200
The town's gone mad
running after the demons.

727
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,680
You!

728
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,640
Jonathan...Please.

729
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
I beg you!

730
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,400
I've got another one
over here!

731
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,600
- Mother!

Shh!

735
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,120
It'll be all right.

736
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,640
You're going
to see her again.

737
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,200
I already know
how protect them.

738
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,120

Damon: Elena, she's a
dead ringer for katherine.

00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:10,780
Our love for katherine
wasn't real, damon.

6
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:12,691
It was real for me.
I'm going to bring her back.

00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:12,975
There's a tomb
underneath the church.

8
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:14,911
A spell sealed katherine in
that tomb, protecting her.

9
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:16,279
Tell me how to get in the tomb.

10
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,780
The grimoire.
Where is it?

11
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:19,849
Check the journal.
Jonathan gilbert's.

12
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,384
The grimoire. It
w emily's, right?

13
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:22,885
That's what you need
to reverse the spell.

14
00:00:22,886 --> 00:00:24,320
I'll help you.

15
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:26,489
You just couldn't
live without me, huh?

16
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,590
Your eye!

00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:28,658

Yeah, I got that from
your 600 voicemails.

00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:04,856
Damon, all night long,
every single street in town,

44
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:06,257
I've been searching.

45
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:08,993
What if your blood hasn't
passed out of her system?

46
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:10,662
Well, then at least you
know you'll see her again.

47
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:12,530
Please.

48
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:14,165
What do you know?

49
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,533
You were with anna. You
st know where she's living.

50
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:18,469
Just tell me
where I can find her.

51
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,338
Nope.

52
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,173
You can go.

53
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,475
Really.

54
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:29,581
You know, all I can
remember is hating you.

55
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:31,783
There might have been a time
when that was different,

56
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:34,619
But your choices have erased
anything good about you.

57
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,858
But see, I also know that youave
just as much reason to hate me.

58
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,827
This all began with me.

59
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:46,264
Katherine got taken away
from you

60
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:48,433
Because me.

61
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:53,638
And I'm sorry.

00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:57,775
Apology accepted.

63
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:00,845
So please,

64
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,280
Ju tell me what you know.

00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:03,848
Huh.

00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,324
I was so stupid!

78
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,660
Oh, he had all

What's going on?
Why are we here?

80
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:54,032
It mt have something to do with
the tomb and emily's spell book.

81
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,099
Spell book?

82
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,401
Damon said that
it could be used

83
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:57,402
To open the tomb.

84
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:59,704
Why didn't I know
about any of this?

85

I was trying
to keep you out of it,

Hoping it would never
come to this.

87
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,044
Come to what?

88
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:07,979
They need a witch...

89
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,182
To break the spell
anlet the vampires out.

90
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:13,484
No way.
I know-

00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:20,458
You're wasting your time.

92
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,994
I'm not going
to help you.

93
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,966
That's why she's here.

00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,401
Motivation for you
to behav

95
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:33,538
You know, you shouldn't
be so desperate.

96
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,741
You made it too easy.

mentioned me.

practically dating.

00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:05,503
You know how much damage
we could do with ten kegs?

00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:06,971
Duke's got it all
hooked up.

109
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,072
Duke's a douche.

110
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:09,774
Yeah, a douche
with ten kegs.

111
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:12,276
Aka, my new best friend.

112
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:14,178
What's the problem,
gilbert?

00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,980
Don't have one,
lockwood.

114
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:17,482
Yeah, I didn't
think so.

115
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,951
You ever get bored of it?
Of what?

116
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:21,319
Yourself?

117
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:26,124
Keep laughing, buddy.

All day about
duke's party.

122
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:34,132
Uh, she went somewhere
with stefan.

123
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:37,001
[sighs] I am so not going

124
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:38,636
Who disappears just because
she has a new boyfriend.

125
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:40,772
Who is duke?

126
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:42,673
Some guy that graduated
a couple years ago.

127
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:46,110
And he throws a party every
time he comes home from duke.

128
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:48,212
Wait, duke goes to duke?

129
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,581
His real name
is bob or something.

130
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:53,951
He's a total ass.
But he buys the beer.

131
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,887
Maybe you should come.

132
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:58,256
Uh, yeah. -
I don't think so.

133
00:06:58,257 --> 00:07:00,725
No, seriously.
Everyone goes.

134
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:03,494
Even quiet loner
little brothers.

135
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:09,367
Think about it.

136
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,903
Hey!
Hey.

137
00:07:11,904 --> 00:07:13,237
So I have speech.

138
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:15,907
It is fully scripted
and well-rehearsed.

139
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:17,075
Are you ready
foit?

140
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:19,343
You wrote a speech?
Yes.

141
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:20,678
It's a "you kissed me

142
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,747
And I don't want things
to be weird" speech.

143
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,348
It's pre-emptive.

144
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:25,783
[chuckles] pre-emptive.

145
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:29,120
Yeah, you know, in case you
were having second thoughts

146
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:30,421
Or regrets

147
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:31,522
Or were,ike,
ooged out-

148
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:32,523
Ooged, huh?

149
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:33,958
[chuckles]

150
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,793
Can I just get on
with the speech part?

151
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:37,061
Yeah, go for it.

152
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:39,464
So I know that
you don't think

153
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:40,832
That this is going to
work out between us.

154
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,768
I just want to let you knowhat
right here and right now,

155
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:45,803
I'm offering you an out.

156
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:47,171
Like an escape clause.

157
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:49,207
Why are you giving me
an escape clause?

158
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:53,644
I don't want to make assumptions
about what it is we are doing here.

159
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:56,280
Got it.

160
00:07:56,281 --> 00:08:00,084
So, if you would
like to exercise it,

161
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:02,753
Just let me know.

162
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:04,856
I'm good, but thanks.

163
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,292
Ok.

164
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:09,961

Hi there.

170
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,407
I'm looking for bonnie.

171
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,042
She's not here.

172
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:26,911
Oh, do you know
when she would

173
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:28,412
Never.

174
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,314
[chuckles]

175
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:32,984
You have quite an opinion
for someone who doesn't know me.

176
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:35,086
You got some nerve knocking
on a bennett witch's door

177
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:36,554
And asking her
for anything.

178
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:38,389
What'd I do?

179
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,258
Spirits talk,
mr. Salvatore,

180
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:42,260
And so does
my granddaughter.

181
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:44,595
You are no friend to us.

182
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:46,397
Now get off
my porch.

183
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:49,700
Step outside and say that.

184
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,008
[groaning]

185
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:00,786
I am not bonnie.

186
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:02,721
You don't want
to mess withe.

187
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:11,897
Bonnie's not going
to open the tomb.

188
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:13,799
Oh, I think
she will.

189
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,268
Do you really want
katherine out that bad?

190
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:18,003
Trust me.

191
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,638
No one I know wants
to see that girl again.

192
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,275
Except damon,
the lovestruck idiot.

193
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,744
Then wt is it?

194
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,413
Or who is it?

195
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:30,449
My mother's in there.

196
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:32,985
Katherine couldn't
help herself.

197
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:35,188
She just had
tooy around

198
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:37,023
With both
of the salvatore brothers.

199
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:39,258
And when she g caught,

200
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,427
So did my mother.

201
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,765
I watched jonathan
gilbert take her away.

202
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:48,100
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:51,671
You really mean that,
don't you?

204
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:53,272
[chuckles]

205
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:56,342
Yeah, I think
wel skip

206
00:09:56,343 --> 00:09:59,045
The dead mom bonding so you
can start serving a purpose.

207
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,013
Which is what?

208
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:02,949
Leverage.

209
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:06,118
This belong to you?
Ah, ah.

210
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:10,256
[dialing]

211
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:11,591
Hmm.

212
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:13,092
Elena, are you ok?

213
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:15,461
She's fine,
for now.

214
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:17,763
Tell me you have the
grimoire and she'll stay fine.

215
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,766
I can get it.

216
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,435
Which means
your brother has it.

217
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:23,803
And I have the witch.

218
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:25,738
So one of you
had bettereet me

219
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:28,040
In the very public
town square in 30 minutes

220
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,342
So we n safely discuss

221
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:31,510
How fun it's going
to be to work together.

222
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,216
Go ahead.

223
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:39,819
Grovel again.
Oh, wait, no.

224
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,188
I don't care.

225
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,527
I'm leaving.

226
00:10:52,232 --> 00:10:54,500
Keep them buttoned down.

227
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:56,435
Compsion won't work.

228
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:58,537
Just use violenc
right.

229
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,172
I got that.

230
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,877
Sit. Behave.

231
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:07,780
You're the key
to this.

232
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,282
Literally.

233
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,751
The one who opens
the door.

234
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:14,654
Tell me, how long
have you been a witch?

235
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:17,523
Is there anything
to drink here?

236
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:19,458
Are you offering?

237
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:23,195
There's water
on the nightstand.

238
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:28,501
Hey. Can I have a sip?

239
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:39,912
Whoa! [gasping]

240
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:44,550
Come back in,
shut the door!

241
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,552
Don't hurt her!

242
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:48,354
Don't make me!

243
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,990
Lock it.

244
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,912
Anna!

245
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:05,180
Hey, what, uh,

246
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:06,915
What happened to you
last night?

247
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,116
Sorry,
I had to leave.

248
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,691
I told your sister
to tell you.

249
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:11,993
Oh, I haven't seen her.

250
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:13,528
Well, I gotta run, so-

251
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:14,830
Hey, do you want to go
to a party tonight?

252
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,398
Do I what?

253
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,599
The guy that's throwing it
is a total douche,

254
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,668
But it's, uh,
it's supposed to be fun.

255
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:21,837
I figured, you know,
safety in numbers.

256
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:24,606
[chuckles] so you're finally
ready to go out with me, are you?

257
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:27,142
It's been a while
since I've been to a party,

258
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:28,710
And I kindwant
to get back out there.

259
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:31,213
And not be such a lor.

260
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:34,149
And, uh, I like you.

261
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,352
You're fun,
and you're also kind of

262
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:41,022
Strange and lurky, but,h,
I guess I like that, too.

263
00:12:41,023 --> 00:12:44,492
So, yeah, you should
come to the party. With me.

264
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:47,996
It's in the woods
by that old cemetery.

265
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,898
Oh.

266
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,733
It's there, huh?

267
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,101
That sounds cool.

268
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:54,903
Uh, I'll meet yo

269
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,472
Oh-ok! Great!

270
00:12:57,473 --> 00:12:59,107
Cool.

271
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:00,642
Ok! [chuckles]

272
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:10,285
Got a hot date,

273
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:13,688
Or are you just planning on
nabbing the entire gilbert family?

274
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:16,258
A party, right next
to the old cemetery.

275
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:17,993
Isn't that nice
of them?

276
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:20,896
Lots of warm bods
for starving vampires.

277
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:23,198
I told you.
I work alone.

278
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:24,633
Yeah, so do I.

279
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:25,867
But you're
minus a witch

280
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,535
And I'm minus
spell book.

281
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:29,437
So what do you say?

282
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,273
Stefan will come after you,
you know that.

283
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:33,742
For messing with elena.

284
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:35,911
Then he won't be too
happy if I kill her

285
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:38,480
When I don't get
what iant.

286
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:40,815
[groans]

287
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:43,451
When do you want
to do this?

288
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:45,020
[exhales]

289
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:48,490
God, it's like 1864
all over again.

290
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:53,261
You salvatores are truly
pathetic when it comes to women.

291
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:55,263
Tonight. After sundown.

292
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,299
Meet at the church.

293
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:04,673
Witches don't have
eternal life, right?

294
00:14:04,674 --> 00:14:07,709
So you guys can die.

295
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,778
Yeah, we can die.

296
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,581
Ah.

297
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:15,583
That sucks.

298
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:17,986
[screaming]

299
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:19,788
Stefan!

300
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,023
Let's get outside.

301
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:24,392
[groaning]

302
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,195
When the sun goes down,

303
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:28,630
Leave town.

304
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,298
If I ever
see you again,

305
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,068
I will kill you.

306
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:36,504
[gasping]

307
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:38,974
[birds chirping]

308
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:41,309
How did you know
where we we?

309
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,512
Many things can
el a witch's power.

310
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:46,715
Worry, anger.

311
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:50,618
After stefan told me that they
had taken you, I had a lot of both.

312
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:55,123
Simple locator spell
was easy after that.

313
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:56,958
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,294
About all of this.

315
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:01,863
Not as sorry
as they're gonna b

316
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:05,166
So what do we do now?

317
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,701
For now, you need
to stay here.

318
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:09,104
A prisoner,
in my own home?

319
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:10,939
I don't think so.

320
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,807
I can't protect you
if you leave the house.

321
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:15,410
We'll protect
ourselves.

322
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:18,913
We need to let him
have katherine back.

323
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:21,182
He's not going to stop
until he gets her.

324
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:22,650
If we help him,
maybe that ends it.

325
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:25,020
No! He doesn't deserve
to get what he wants.

326
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:27,355
What other choice
do we have?

327
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:32,694
Witches being pulled
down by vampire problems.

328
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:35,730
As much as we tried
to do to stay out of it.

329
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,068
I'll open the tomb.

330
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,503
You get
your brother'sirl,

331
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:44,739
And destroy the rest
with fire.

332
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,308
Then this will be
all over.

333
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:49,077
We still have to get
damon to agree.

334
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,278
He already agreed once.

335
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,213
Yeah, and then we
double cross him.

336
00:15:52,214 --> 00:15:53,448
So now he's angr

337
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,884
He's hurt.
There's a difference.

338
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:00,388
I think I know
what I have to do.

339
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:06,294
[chuckles]

340
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:09,597
You've got
to be kidding me.

341
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:13,935
It was stefan.

342
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:16,037
There was nothing
I could-

343
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:18,740
Shut up!
Stop talking.

344
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:23,711
Without the witch,

345
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:27,215
We don't have damon
or the grimoire.

346
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:30,351
Damon's not going
to stop.

347
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:33,855
He'll find a way
to get in.

348
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:37,826
And we're going to be
there when he does.

349
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:50,939
I'm going to have
to change the locks.

350
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,841
Did you stage
a jailbreak?

351
00:16:52,842 --> 00:16:54,742
Stefan.
Oh, brother.

352
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:57,846
Ever the white knight.

353
00:16:57,847 --> 00:17:00,815
I convinced bonnie
to help you.

354
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,517
I doubt that.

355
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:04,385
I'm not going to say
that I'm sorry

356
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:05,920
We got the grimoire
without you last night,

357
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:09,057
Because I'm not, really.

358
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:10,391
Well, at least you're honest.

359
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:12,894
I was protecting
the people I love, damon.

360
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,330
But so were you,

361
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:17,832
In your own,
twisted way.

362
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:18,900
And as hard
as it is to figure,

363
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:20,335
We're all on
the same side,

364
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,803
After the same thing.

365
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:23,638
Not interested.
Yes, you a.

366
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:26,274
Because you were willing
to work with us yesterday.

367
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:29,344
Foole once,
shame on you.

368
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:30,845
Ok, when we were
in atlanta,

369
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:33,581
Why didn't you use
your compulsion on me?

370
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:38,052
Who's to say I didn't?

371
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:40,655
You didn't.

372
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:44,058
I know you didn't.

373
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,494
But you could have.

374
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:50,632
You and I...

375
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,434
We have something.

376
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:57,272
An understanding.

377
00:17:57,273 --> 00:18:00,542
And I know that
my betrayal hurt you,

378
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:02,977
Different from how it is
with you andtefan,

379
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:05,113
But I'm promising you
this now,

380
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:07,749
I ll help you
get katherine back.

381
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,618
[groans]

382
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,754
I wish I could believe you

383
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:19,861
Ask me
if I'm lying now.

384
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,737
No animal will stop,
by the way,

385
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:32,273
No matter what I do.

386
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:36,311
Then we'll deal
with it.

387
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:53,695
I didn't compel you in atlanta
because we were having fun.

388
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:59,234
I wanted it to be real.

389
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:04,906
I'm trusting you.

390
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:09,911
Don't make me regret it.

391
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:25,488
The duke party.
I forgot.

392
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:27,056
I hope they stay
clear of the church.

393
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:28,458
Your hope, n mine.

394
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,725
Matt: Elena, hey.

395
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:32,795
Elena, oh, my god.
Where have you been?

396
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:35,798
Long story,
no time to tell it.

397
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,733
Wasn't talking to you.
Sure you were.

398
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:40,069
We haven't met.
I'm matt.

399
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,104
Matt, there's a reason
we haven't met.

400
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:43,873
You and I are
going that way.

401
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:45,942
Ahhh. I'm sorry,
you guys.

402
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,349
Cleared the debris away.

403
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,785
Set the torches
like you asked.

404
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:58,120
We can get down now.

405
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:00,790
Elena: What is that?

406
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,093
It's everything I need
to destroy them.

407
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:07,096
Are you sure damon
will come back with her?

408
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:09,131
[damon whistles]

409
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:12,635
Brother, witches.

410
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:13,769
Everything ok?

411
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,204
I just want
to get this over with.

412
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:16,839
Are we ready?

413
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,275
I guess so.

414
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:21,277
[all cheering]

415
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:23,279
[rock music playing]

416
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,747
Done!

417
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:26,716
[laughter]

418
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:29,852
Hey, uh,
I'll be right back.

419
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:32,588
Hey, man.

420
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:35,525
Uh, you got any weed?

421
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,260
Wait, you're kidding me,
right?

422
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:40,296
You act like a total dick
every time we cross paths,

423
00:20:40,297 --> 00:20:42,431
And now you want
to party witme?

424
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:44,467
[indistinct] I'm just
asking question.

425
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,435
Dude, I don't geyou, man.

426
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:47,570
It's aarty.

427
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:49,138
You're a partier, ok?

428
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,439
There's no need
to psychoanalyze it.

429
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,874
I don't party anyme.

430
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,043
And even if I did,
it wouldn't be with you.

431
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,445
No problem.

432
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:58,548
Carry on just standing
there, by yourself.

433
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,816
All alone.

434
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,485
The enemy of fun.

435
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:06,055
Do you even have
any friends?

436
00:21:13,764 --> 00:21:16,866
[chuckles]

437
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:18,701
Thank go

438
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:20,870
Weird hello, but ok.

439
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:22,438
What's the matter?

440
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,641
Uh, nothin'.
Nothing, just...

441
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:29,178
It's nothin'.

442
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:31,614
Come on, let walk.

443
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,586
Air.

444
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,754
Earth.

445
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,890
Fire.

446
00:21:40,891 --> 00:21:42,725
Water.

447
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:46,028
That's it,
just water from the tap?

448
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:47,897
As opposed
to what?

449
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:49,599
I just figured maybit
would have to be blessed

450
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,001
Or mystical
or something.

451
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,572
What's that?

452
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:58,608
It's for katherine.

453
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,977
Gotta have something
to get her going.

454
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:03,512
Unless your girl's
offering a vein to tap.

455
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:06,215
[sighs]

456
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:08,951
Admit it-

457
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,554
You can't wait
to get rid of me.

458
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:13,923
[chuckles]

459
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:16,392
I can't wait
to get rid of you.

460
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:18,060
Hmm.

461
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:21,430
You ready?

462
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:23,432
[indistinct chatter]

463
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:26,435
This place is wild.

464
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:27,837
You kinda like
dead people, huh?

465
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:30,406
I'm strange, remember?

466
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,009
You ok?

467
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,645
Yeah, yeah.
Uh...

468
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,913
This place makes me
think about someone.

469
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:39,415
A dead someone?

470
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,817
No, no, just...

471
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,754
Someone I used
to know.

472
00:22:46,189 --> 00:22:47,556
So, uh, hey.
[chuckles]

473
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:50,726
We made it all of, what,
37 minutes in that party?

474
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:53,029
Not your scene?

475
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,731
No, I'm not really su
what my scene is anymore.

476
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:57,500
Hmm.

477
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,935
So what do you say?

478
00:22:59,936 --> 00:23:03,973
You want to be
part of my non-scene?

479
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:07,376
I would happily
be a part of your non-scene,

480
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:11,313
Except, uh,
I'm leaving.

481
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:13,683
Wait, what?

482
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:16,285
Yeah. My mom and I
are moving away.

483
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:18,754
Oh, uh...

484
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:21,924
That's-
that's a bummer.

485
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:25,194
Yeah?
Well, yeah.

486
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,363
So...

487
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,299
Guess this is good-bye.

488
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,836
I guess it is.

489
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:44,847
Anna, your face!

490
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:46,382
It's nothing.

491
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,350
It didn't look like
nothing.

492
00:23:51,455 --> 00:23:53,489
[sighs] you didn't have
to hit him that hard.

493
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,392
Yes, I did.

494
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:59,662
Grab him,
and let's go.

495
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:03,399
I'm taking him
to meet my mother.

496
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,205
Where's your date?

497
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:15,507
Who knows?

498
00:24:15,508 --> 00:24:17,509
Ah, is the honeymoon
over already?

499
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,711
Maybe.

500
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,379
After all that grief you
gave me about liking her.

501
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,114
I figured it would have lasted
longer than five minutes.

502
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:26,284
Look, I just
- I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing.

503
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:29,854
She-she seems like
she might be a little clingy.

504
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:31,389
Well, good.

505
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,824
I need my boy single
anyway.

506
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:34,559

There you are.
Here I am.

510

Yeah, well, I'm not
drunk enough,

511
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:45,203
So I'm just going
to go get another beer.

512
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:48,940
So...

513
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:50,975
So.

514
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:52,777
I have
another speech.

515
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:54,546
Ok.

516
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:57,916
The hand thing
with elena,

517
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:59,751
It was lame.

518
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:02,387
Well, I was lame.

519
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:04,923

521
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:09,093
And he was always
such a jerk to me.

522
00:25:09,094 --> 00:25:10,828
And...

523
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:13,565
I wanted to show off that
I was with the good guy.

524
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:17,001
So, anyway,
I was lame.

525
00:25:18,304 --> 00:25:19,704
So...

526
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:22,373
Forgiven?

527
00:25:23,342 --> 00:25:25,410
Yeah, course.

528
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:26,945
Yeah.

[chanting
in foreign language]

530
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:02,647
What's happening?

531
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:09,520
It worked!

532
00:26:10,556 --> 00:26:12,457
Of course
it worked.

533
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,459
Weave some fires

You think I'm going
to go in there by myself

537
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:28,072

Don't take her in.

Look, he needs
leverage.

543

He needs to know
that you're not going

Why did you
let her go in?

568
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:09,340
Because she isn't
coming out, baby.

didn't remove the seal,

It just opened the door.

Damon can't.

But is there anything
that you need?

716
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:21,943
Oh, no, I'm just-
I'm gonna crash.

717
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:25,613
Ok. Well, jenna's here,
and I'll be back soon.

718
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,412
You knew katherine
wasn't in there.

719
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:59,948
You wouldn't
have helped me.

720
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:01,216
No!

721
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:03,151
Why do you get happiness?

722
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:05,753
Damon, please, you wouldn't have
helped me! You know you wouldn't!

723
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:07,021
Why do you get it
and I don't?!

724
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:09,190
The guard,
the way of the judge,

725
00:38:09,191 --> 00:38:10,291
They really
want this thing!

726
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:12,660
She promised to turn him

727
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:15,129
He was oessed
with her.

728
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:20,468
She had him under her
spell, like everybody else!

729
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:21,936
He let her go.

730
00:38:21,937 --> 00:38:25,139
[gasping]

731
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,042
The last I saw her

732
00:38:28,043 --> 00:38:30,511
Was chicago.

733
00:38:30,512 --> 00:38:32,480
1983.

734
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:35,283
She knew where
you were, damon.

735
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:39,787
She didn't care.

736
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:45,026
Sorry.

737
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:55,036
[music playing]

738
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,676
I just got tbonnie's.

739
00:39:01,677 --> 00:39:03,845
Everything all right? Yeah.

740
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:06,347
How's damon?
Is he going to be ok?

741
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:08,850
I don't know.

742
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:11,219
Can I call you later?

743
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,054
Yeah, of course.

744
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,498
Grams?

745
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:59,834
Grams, wake up!

746
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,971
Grams!

747
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:05,640
Grams?!

748
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:09,644
[sobbing] elena!

749
00:40:09,645 --> 00:40:11,245
Help!

750
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:13,114
Wake up!

751
00:40:13,115 --> 00:40:16,651
She's not breathing!
She's not breathing!

752
00:40:16,652 --> 00:40:19,587
Please, wake up!

753
00:40:19,588 --> 00:40:21,789
I'm gonna fix it!

754
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,857
Yes, I need
an ambulance.

755
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:24,559
It's ok, I can fix this.

756
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,627
It's an emergency.

757
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:30,498
No, no!
I can fix this!

758
00:40:30,499 --> 00:40:32,266
Grams, I can fix this!
Bonnie!

<i>Previously On "The Vampire Diaries"...</i>

00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,327
For over a century, I have lived in secret,

3
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:07,564
Until now. I know the risk,
But I have to know her.

4
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:09,032
Elena, she's a dead ringer for katherine.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,433
Why do I look like her?

6
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:12,502
You were adopted. This girl showed up.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,804
She was 16 and about to give birth.

8
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:16,940
What else do you know about her?

9
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,242
Just her name, isobel.
My wife isobel spent her life

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,277
Researching paranormal activity in this area.

11
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:22,879
Where's your wife? Damon killed her.

12
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:24,848
There's a tomb underneath the church.

13
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:27,350
The spell sealed katherine
in that tomb, protecting her.

14
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:28,952
I'm gonna bring her back.

15
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,386
She's not here!

16
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:32,021
You knew katherine wasn't in there.

17
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:34,724
She knew where you were, and she didn't care.

18
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:54,210
Jeez! You scared me.

19
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:57,080
Do you know what day it is?

20
00:00:57,148 --> 00:01:02,218
It's Saturday. And what year?

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,124
It's 2010. Are you ok?

22
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:09,459
Thank you.

23
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,196
Wait, what's your name? It's harper, sir.

24
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:15,732
How did you get out here?

25
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:19,435
And why are you dressed like that?

26
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:25,041
You seem like a very nice person.

27
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,845
I'm sorry. Sorry for what?

28
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,376
Hey, bonnie, it's me just checking in,

29
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:03,913
Seeing how you're doing. We miss you here.

30
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:06,883
Don't let your aunt drive you too crazy.

31
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,852
Come home soon. Love you.

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,487
What are you doin' out here?

33
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:14,290
- It's cold.
- Thinking, writing.

34
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:17,093
The, uh, funeral for bonnie's grandma,

35
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,862
It brought back a lot about mom and dad.

36
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,866
I was wondering. You said that you
would do some digging about them,

37
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:27,070
The adoption. Right.

38
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:30,273
So did you? Dig?

39
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,176
Come on inside.

40
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,713
Your dad kept everything
from his medical practice--

41
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,282
Records, logs, Old appointment books.

42
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,619
I found an entry from
the night you were born.

43
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:45,588
Patient and a birth date. Isobel peterson.

44
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:47,223
Do you think that's her real name?

45
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,224
Pregnant teenage runaway?

46
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,026
Probably not. First name, maybe.

47
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:53,329
But where'd she get peterson?
Classmate? Best friend?

48
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,898
So I binged it.

49
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:58,868
I searched for all the petersons in this area

50
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:01,137
Born the same year as isobel, found 3--

51
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:04,641
2 men and a woman, trudie,

52
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,542
Who lived in grove hill, virginia.

53
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,014
That's not far from here. Well, watch this.

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,887
Isobel.

55
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,128
She was a cheerleader.
Trudie still lives there.

56
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:29,966
This is her address. What about isobel?

57
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:34,504
I couldn't find anything about her.

58
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:43,746
Listen. There's something else.

59
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:47,050
Mr. Saltzman, rick,
His wife was from around here,

60
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:49,719
And her name was also isobel.

61
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:59,228
Wait. "was," as in... She died.

62
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:04,767
Alaric's wife might have been your mother?

63
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:07,503
it can't be true, right?

64
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:11,574
I mean, the coincidence alone is just crazy.

65
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:16,079
I have the address for her friend trudie.

66
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:17,447
You wanna talk to her.

67
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:23,453
I don't know. I... I--I don't know.

68
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,523
If it's true and they are the same person,

69
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,526
That means that my birth mother is dead,

70
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:34,931
And I don't know if I could handle that.

71
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:39,502
Elena, did jenna tell you
anything about alaric's wife?

72
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,938
How she died?

73
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:45,475
Just that she was killed and
the case was never solved.

74
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:49,045
You knew that already?

75
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:55,218
The night at the school when he attacked me,

76
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:58,254
He told me some things about her death.

77
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:01,324
Well-- no, no. It's not possible.

78
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:04,594
The coincidence is-- it's too much.

79
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,529
Now, listen, if you do decide to go

80
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,465
Talk to isobel's friend,
I'll go with you. Ok?

81
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,468
I just don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

82
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:20,376
I should get goin'.

83
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:23,713
I gotta go deal with damon.

84
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:28,684
How's he doing? He's dealing in his own way.

85
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:42,498
How do I taste?

86
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:46,002
Oh, so much better than your friends.

87
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,673
But shh. Don't tell them.
They might get jealous.

88
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:55,845
No. Buzzkill bob.

89
00:05:55,913 --> 00:06:00,450
Greetings. Can we talk?

90
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:03,786
Yeah. Without the tri-delts.

91
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:05,588
Anything you have to say to me,

92
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,723
You can say in front of them.

93
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,460
They're really good at keeping secrets.

94
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:15,364
You're worried about me.
That's nice. Don't be.

95
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:17,800
There's no need. I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?

96
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:21,337
Spent the last 145 years with one goal,

97
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:23,940
Get in that tomb. I succeeded.

98
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,242
Granted, katherine wasn't
in there to be rescued,

99
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,376
But why dwell?

100
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:30,213
No, it's so liberating
not having a master plan,

101
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,116
Because I can do whatever the hell I want.

102
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,519
That's kind of what I'm afraid of.

103
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:39,856
Relax. I haven't killed anyone in-- too long.

104
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,659
Those girls?

105
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:47,230
Will end up in their dorm with headaches,

106
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:51,300
Think they blacked out. Business as usual.

107
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:54,971
Predictable you didn't pull
me over here for a pep talk.

108
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,274
So drink up. Spill it, brother.

109
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,212
There was a woman you may
have known a few years back

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,348
Named isobel in north carolina at duke.

111
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:09,085
You wanna discuss the women in
my past right now? Seriously?

112
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:11,554
You killed her. What's your point?

113
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:14,457
I just--just wanna know if you
remember anything about her.

114
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:17,326
Oh, it's like a needle in a haystack, stefan.

115
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,128
Well, think hard. It's important.

116
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:24,066
Nothing is important, not anymore.

117
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:27,203
Great chat.

118
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:30,506
I have to go and exploit some
women in the name of grief,

119
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:33,809
Which I'm sure you understand.

120
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:37,480
"ttfn," said the tri-delt. Heh.

121
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:45,955
- -
- What?

122
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:48,457
This is boring. I'm bored.

123
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:55,131
But we have this entire house to ourselves.

124
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:57,733
I mean, it's practically a bachelor pad.

125
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:03,105
And... So shouldn't we do something

126
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:06,742
A little bit more bachelor-paddy?

127
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,845
What? Something like this?

128
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:17,119
Something like that. I don't know.

129
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:19,989
This is a pretty good show. Seriously?

130
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:42,345
Oh, god. Not on my couch.

131
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:46,349
Mom. Hey.

132
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:50,186
I don't know. It's just weird, you know,

133
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:52,221
Me being raffled off like a disney cruise.

134
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:55,257
In this town, Fundraising is
like indentured servitude.

135
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:59,395
You don't have a choice.
Besides, you're a bachelor,

136
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:01,030
And you're eligible, so there you go.

137
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:03,733
Here. Let me help you with this.

138
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:20,016
Oh, god. I can't believe I'm gonna do this.

139
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,017
What?

140
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,352
I am totally gonna ruin this moment,

141
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,655
But I--I have to tell you.

142
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:27,923
Elena recently found out she was adopted,

143
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,559
And she's been looking
for her birth mother...

144
00:09:30,627 --> 00:09:35,665
Whose name was isobel. Isobel? Like my wife?

145
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:38,501
Isobel never had a baby. Are you sure?

146
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:39,869
Not before you were together?

147
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:42,104
Nope. No way.

148
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:52,615
This is elena's birth mother.

149
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:03,292
Ah, she, uh-- She never told me.

150
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:08,964
I, uh-- I'm gonna go.

151
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:11,867
Yeah, I'm gonna-- gonna go.

152
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:40,262
Trudie? Tru-trudie peterson?

153
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,598
Yes. Uh, my name is elena gilbert.

154
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:46,469
I wanted to talk to you
about isobel flemming.

155
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:48,938
Well, I haven't heard that name in years.

156
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,340
How do you know her?

157
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:56,011
I think that, um, well...

158
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,483
Do you know if she had a baby
that she gave up for adoption?

159
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,857
My god. You're her daughter.

160
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:14,663
I was just gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

161
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,235
Sure. Uh, the kitchen's this way.

162
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,071
I wasn't gonna come. I didn't think I was,

163
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:34,340
But I was driving, and I hit this stoplight,

164
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:37,710
And it made me think
about when I was learning

165
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:40,579
How to drive and then my
mom would always warn me

166
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:42,715
About this blind turn on the left-hand side,

167
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:45,351
And then I was thinking about my mom, and--

168
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,921
I had your address. I'm sorry for barging in.

169
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:53,025
It's no problem. Just a surprise, though.

170
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,594
I haven't thought about isobel in years.

171
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:56,995
When was the last time you saw her?

172
00:11:57,063 --> 00:12:02,000
About 17 years ago,
When she left to go have you.

173
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:06,972
We kept in touch for a while, But,
well, you know, people drift apart.

174
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,041
And you don't know where she ended up?

175
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:10,676
She was in florida for a while.

176
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:13,746
She was on her own. I know it wasn't easy.

177
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:19,418
Do you have any idea who my father is?

178
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:23,722
I could never get her to fess up.

179
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:29,228
Anyway, she finally pulled it together,

180
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,497
Got into college on a scholarship.

181
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:34,867
Where did she go?
Somewhere in north carolina.

182
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:39,071
Duke, I think. Smart girl, smart school.

183
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,708
Let me just grab that.

184
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,189
So it's been a few months. Where you been?

185
00:12:57,257 --> 00:12:58,857
Ah, you know, here and there,

186
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,259
Never one place too long.

187
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:03,495
You know pete. No, actually, I don't,

188
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:06,098
Because you never brought him around.

189
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,002
So blonde's the new flavor of the month, huh?

190
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,271
So sorry I scared her off.

191
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,940
She's not a flavor, mom. I like her.

192
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:19,478
So she's the one? No,
probably not, but maybe.

193
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:23,115
Matt, seriously,
lezzie forbes' daughter? Ucch.

194
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,884
Mom, seriously, Knock it off.

195
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:38,297
Ice, please. So, uh, you heard from vic?

196
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:40,466
No, but don't worry.

197
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:43,202
She'll come home eventually
when she needs something.

198
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,138
I played that game. Are you playing it now?

199
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:48,273
No. Then what are you doin' home?

200
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:51,510
You trying to say I need
a reason to come back?

201
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,315
Sit down. Eat with me.

202
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:01,153
Tell me everything I've missed, hmm.

203
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,794
Thanks for meeting me. Something's come up.

204
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:11,630
Jenna told you. Yeah. So it's true.

205
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:14,132
Your wife isobel was elena's birth mother.

206
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,170
What does elena know? about your wife?

207
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:20,239
About everything. About you, your brother.

208
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:21,607
She knows what I am,

209
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:24,309
And she knows that you
know about the vampires.

210
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:26,678
Does she know about damon and isobel?

211
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:30,516
No. I couldn't tell her,
not until I was sure.

212
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,918
You said you'd help me.

213
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,987
I asked damon without saying too much.

214
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,588
He doesn't remember. Ask him again.

215
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:37,956
Damon is not stable right now.

216
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:39,324
You know, he murdered my wife

217
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:41,627
Or at the very least made a meal out of her.

218
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,862
When has he been stable?
I'm telling you not to push this.

219
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,097
Give me a reason not to.

220
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,698
Your survival. How's that for a reason?

221
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:50,602
I'll handle it, but for now,
I need you to let it go.

222
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,671
Is that what you'll tell elena?

223
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:53,906
Let it go?

224
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:05,183
Leave elena out of this.
I need to know what happened.

225
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:07,486
I think you would, too.

226
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,659
I need something more than
just your wife's name,

227
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,827
A picture, something I could show damon.

228
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:32,244
Is.

229
00:15:32,312 --> 00:15:34,479
Just a few more minutes. Can't you, uh--

230
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:36,748
Can't you finish this in the morning?

231
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,517
But I like working at night.

232
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:40,552
Yeah. See, I like sleeping at night.

233
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,254
With you.

234
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:49,761
Ok, I'll bite. What is it, thesis stuff?

235
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:55,167
Look, baby, I'm in a
3-way here with you and your computer,

236
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:58,904
The least you can do is let
me know what you're up to.

237
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:11,183
I was doing research,
And I dug up all this stuff

238
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,685
About this small town in
virginia near where I grew up.

239
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:17,089
It's isolated, out of the way, and quiet,

240
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:19,825
And every now and then,
people die mysteriously,

241
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:22,227
And they say that it's animal attacks.

242
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,730
Except, these bodies are drained of blood.

243
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:29,534
It's vampires. It has to be.

244
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:34,039
Ok. I'll get my garlic and holy water,

245
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:36,108
And then maybe, just maybe... No.

246
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,745
We can get some sleep. Come here. -No.

247
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:41,446
Look, this is why I love you,

248
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:45,183
Because you believe in all of this stuff,

249
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:48,186
So much so that you're
making a degree out of it.

250
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:53,659
You're like mulder, except hotter and a girl.

251
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:55,927
This is not a joke, rick.

252
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,900
You think that this is cute,
But I'm gonna prove it.

253
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,443
And mulder was right in the end.

254
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:15,714
Ah. They came to the games for us.

255
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:18,316
The football team hadn't won in years.

256
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,686
We were the stars. Well, izzie was.

257
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:23,021
But I was a damn good backup.

258
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,923
Heh. This is great. Thank you.

259
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,025
You're welcome.

260
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,361
You haven't touched your tea.

261
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:31,530
Oh. Yeah.

262
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:39,404
What is this?

263
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,306
Oh, it's just some herbal mixture.

264
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:43,308
Vervain?

265
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,047
You know. Know what?

266
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:53,452
You didn't invite me in,
And you're serving vervain tea.

267
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,420
You know.

268
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,857
I think that you should probably leave.

269
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:01,493
Wait. What are you not telling me?

270
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:04,930
Please leave. Now!

271
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:46,772
Bourbon. Rocks.

272
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:51,109
Behold the teacher.

273
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:54,613
Don't you have some papers to grade?

274
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,382
It's, uh, more fun with a buzz.

275
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,952
Well, most things in life are.
Sober's depressing.

276
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,455
You don't strike me as
somebody who gets depressed.

277
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:05,791
You say that like you know me.

278
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:10,328
Nope. Just a hunch.

279
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:20,639
You have a good afternoon. Not likely.

280
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,313
Daytime drinking, huh? It's all the rage.

281
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:31,249
Listen, I need a favor.
You ever been in love?

282
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:34,286
Excuse me? Have you ever
been so bent on someone,

283
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:36,822
That you just have your
heart ripped out by them?

284
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:41,760
You forget I was married. Right. Gay husband.

285
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:48,633
She'll have what I'm having. Sit down.

286
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:52,637
There's a fundraiser here tonight

287
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:54,739
That the founder's council is throwing.

288
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:58,109
The town's most eligible bachelors
get raffled off for dates,

289
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:02,047
And, well, we're short a bachelor.

290
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:05,517
Is this what you do when there's no, um...

291
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:09,321
Vampires? Organize bachelor
raffles? Oh, trust me.

292
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,623
At this point, I miss the vampires.

293
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:13,725
Look, you're a hero to this town, damon.

294
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:15,560
I know most people don't know it,

295
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:19,030
But you are, and you're single and a catch.

296
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:20,532
Oh, come on. Help me out.

297
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,035
Carol lockwood won't let me live
it down if I come up empty-handed.

298
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:31,910
You know, a room full of women
clamoring to win a date with me

299
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:36,681
Sounds tasty. Thank you. One thing.

300
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,384
Can you get information on someone for me?

301
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:40,752
Alaric saltzman, the history teacher.

302
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,021
There's just something
a little off about him,

303
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:46,291
And I just-- I just wanna
make sure that the high school

304
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,626
Did their homework on this guy.

305
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:50,528
You got it. Thanks.

306
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:02,140
May I help you? Thank you for the text.

307
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:07,746
You're welcome. I didn't tell her anything.

308
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:11,216
I--I kept my promise. Good.

309
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:13,318
The girl, though, She--she knew something.

310
00:21:13,386 --> 00:21:17,088
That won't be a problem.
She won't get any closer to the truth.

311
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:22,093
Good. So I'm done?

312
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:28,667
Yes. You're done. No! I won't invite you in.

313
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:29,834
You can't come in!

314
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:32,871
I'm not a vampire, so, yes, I can.

315
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,273
I don't understand.

316
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:37,776
I did what you told me. I did my part!

317
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:39,044
And now I have to do mine.

318
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,668
Stefan. Better.

319
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:35,838
Me. You look, um...

320
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:38,707
Dashing? Gorgeous? Irresistible?

321
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,775
Wrecked.

322
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:43,078
- You look wrecked.
- No reason why.

323
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:47,750
Do you know that I am one of mystic
falls' most eligible bachelors?

324
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:49,585
- Huh.
- Yep.

325
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:54,390
- How are you doing?
- Never better.

326
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:58,127
Yep. What can I do for you?

327
00:22:58,194 --> 00:23:00,262
I'm a barrel of favors today.

328
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,198
It's my newfound purpose-
how can I help people?

329
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:06,301
I'm just meeting stefan.
We're going to the fundraiser.

330
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:13,308
Help a guy out, will you? Can't get this.

331
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:25,020
So I found out who my birth mother is.

332
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:26,722
Ecch. Who cares?

333
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,427
She left you. She sucks.

334
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,601
Stefan. There you are.

335
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:47,576
Uhh. I need a bigger jacket. Wow. You know,

336
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:50,012
An occasional sorority girl might, um,

337
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,849
You know, help fill you out a little bit.

338
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,489
He's fine. He's damon.

339
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:02,091
Maybe this heartache will be good for him.

340
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:05,194
It'll remind him that he has one,
even if it doesn't beat.

341
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:07,796
Won't hold my breath.

342
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,634
So I went to see trudie peterson.

343
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:16,839
I know. I'm sorry. I didn't plan it.

344
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,110
How was it? She has vervain.

345
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:22,611
She knows about vampire stuff,

346
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,346
And it can't be a coincidence.

347
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:30,919
It isn't. This is alaric's wife.

348
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:35,357
This is her. This is isobel.
He gave this to you?

349
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:38,093
Everything he knows about vampires,
he learned from her.

350
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:42,231
He believes that she was killed by one.

351
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,201
Oh, my god. Listen, elena, there's a lot

352
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,537
About isobel that alaric can tell you,

353
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:51,306
But I need you to hold off a little while

354
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:52,608
Before you talk to him.

355
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:54,843
Why? I know that it's a lot to ask of you,

356
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,880
But will you do that for me?

357
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,152
Tickets for the raffle are now on sale.

358
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:07,055
All proceeds benefit the annual
founder's day celebration.

359
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:08,690
That's a good look for you.

360
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,126
What? Embarrassing and uncomfortable?

361
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:13,896
Yep. That's-- that's the one.

362
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:17,666
Hey, look. I'm, uh, sorry about earlier.

363
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,935
It was just kind of a--a shock.

364
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:23,572
Well, I'm sorry for dropping it on you,

365
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,040
But I felt like you should know.

366
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,742
No, I get it.

367
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:29,077
At some point, maybe you
and elena could talk.

368
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:32,181
I'm sure she'd like to hear
about isobel, what she was like.

369
00:25:32,248 --> 00:25:36,251
Yeah. Uh... Or not. No pressure.

370
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:40,022
I don't know if that's a--a great idea.

371
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:43,559
at least not--not for a while.

372
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:48,463
Where'd our girlfriend go?
She's on her way to the grill.

373
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,035
I, uh, wanted to talk to you.

374
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,505
This is the woman, isobel,

375
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:58,340
From north carolina. Remember her now?

376
00:25:58,408 --> 00:26:01,743
Who wants to know? -I do.
Who else wants to know?

377
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:06,582
Did you kill her? Sorry. Don't know her.

378
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,317
Hey, are you comin'?

379
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:11,887
The real housewives of mystic falls await.

380
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:14,356
He's already been hit on, like, 35 times.

381
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:15,791
He's total cougar bait.

382
00:26:15,858 --> 00:26:16,792
Impressive.

383
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:18,227
More like embarrassing.

384
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:19,895
Heh heh. Hi, mrs. Donovan.

385
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:24,066
Elena, honey. Hi, kelly.

386
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:26,368
Long time, no see.
How are you doing? Oh, same old.

387
00:26:26,436 --> 00:26:28,570
Oh. Matty tells me you broke his heart.

388
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:31,273
Mom. Just kidding. Calm down.

389
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:35,844
He found his rebound girl. Oh.
Here you go, sweetheart.

390
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:37,012
However many that'll buy.

391
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,549
I just hope I don't get bachelor 3.
I dated him in high school.

392
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:41,550
Not impressive.

393
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:43,118
in any way.

394
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:47,589
Very exciting.

395
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:58,367
I've got the big date planned.

396
00:26:58,434 --> 00:27:01,770
It's a romantic dinner,
Secluded spot somewhere woodsy.

397
00:27:01,838 --> 00:27:04,006
You're making me think I should buy a ticket.

398
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:07,876
Well, you are in charge.
You could always rig it.

399
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,414
Pardon me.

400
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,119
I ran the check on the history teacher.

401
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:19,221
You want this before or after your big debut?

402
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,290
How's it look? He checks out.

403
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:22,324
Couple of speeding tickets.

404
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,759
It's a rough story, though.

405
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,060
Turns out his wife went missing

406
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:26,495
A few years back in north carolina.

407
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:31,033
North carolina? She have a name?

408
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:37,072
Yeah. Isobel. Isobel.

409
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:54,775
And what do you do, bachelor number 3?

410
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:58,345
Yeah, I'm a plumber.
Well, isn't that wonderful?

411
00:27:58,413 --> 00:27:59,913
We could always use more plumbers.

412
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:01,915
Moving on.

413
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:05,519
Number 4, "alaric saltzman."

414
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,121
Wow. That's quite a mouthful.

415
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:08,288
What do you do, alaric?

416
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:10,124
I'm a teacher at mystic falls high.

417
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:13,026
Oh, beauty and brains, ladies.

418
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:15,763
This one's a keeper. What do you teach?

419
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,433
- History.
- History. Oh, well, give us a fun fact

420
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:21,969
About mystic falls, something crazy.

421
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:27,641
Uh, well...

422
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,879
He probably saving the
best stories for his date.

423
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:37,050
And last, but not least, Damon salvatore.

424
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:41,455
We don't have much on you.
Well, I'm tough to fit on a card.

425
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:43,590
Do you have any hobbies, like to travel?

426
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:46,393
Oh, yeah. L.A., new york.

427
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:49,163
Couple of years ago, I was in north carolina,

428
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,831
Near the duke campus, actually.

429
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:53,500
I think--I think alaric when to school there.

430
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:54,535
Didn't you, rick?

431
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:57,871
Yeah, 'cause I-- I know your wife did.

432
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:00,841
I had a drink with her once.

433
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:03,510
She was--she was a great girl.

434
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:06,980
I ever tell you that? 'cause she was--

435
00:29:07,048 --> 00:29:10,417
She-- Delicious.

436
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:22,362
Are you ok? I just need some air.

437
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:29,770
Elena. He killed her?

438
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:31,605
Damon was the vampire that killed her?

439
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:33,974
I don't know what happened.
Alaric said that they never found the body.

440
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:34,975
Oh, my god. Stefan.

441
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:37,945
I know. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you,

442
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:40,314
But I just-- I wanted to know more.

443
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,549
I was feeling sorry for him,

444
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:45,486
Hoping that this whole katherine
thing would change him.

445
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:46,620
I'm so stupid.

446
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:48,555
He doesn't know about the connection to you.

447
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:50,691
I thought about confronting him,
but he's already so on edge.

448
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:52,626
Why are you protecting him?

449
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:57,664
Because you're not the only one
hoping that he might actually change.

450
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:05,606
That man.

451
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:09,543
I saw that man outside of trudie's.

452
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:12,312
Get back inside. Come on.

453
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:22,422
And bachelor number 3 goes to 37458.

454
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,229
Ah. Kelly donovan. Lovely.

455
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:33,166
You and the plumber should have so much fun.

456
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:34,835
Congratulations, mrs. Donovan.

457
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:39,606
Ok, just stop. Stop trying so hard.

458
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:43,043
This thing you're doing,
this nice thing, it's fake,

459
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:44,244
Like you, like your mom,

460
00:30:44,312 --> 00:30:46,113
And for some reason, matt fell for it,

461
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,282
But that doesn't mean that I will.

462
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:49,850
I don't like you, ok?

463
00:30:49,918 --> 00:30:53,086
So tell plumber boy I'll be at the bar.

464
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:58,425
Ok. Whoa. Easy there.

465
00:30:58,493 --> 00:30:59,626
Buy a ticket like everyone else.

466
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:02,262
Did you enjoy that,
Rubbing it in to alaric saltzman?

467
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,297
What?

468
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:05,265
Just as I was starting to think that there

469
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,934
Was something redeemable about you.

470
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:10,037
Elena. Am I missing something here?

471
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:12,472
Did I forget to mention
earlier when we were talking

472
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,576
About my birth mother,
The one that gave me up?

473
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:17,978
Her name was isobel.

474
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:25,385
Go ahead. Reminisce about how you killed her.

475
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:41,101
Come on. Let's get you home.
I have a message for you.

476
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:44,004
What? Who are you? Stop looking.

477
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:45,405
Stop looking for what?

478
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:49,676
She doesn't want to know you.
She doesn't want to talk to you.

479
00:31:49,744 --> 00:31:51,144
Isobel?

480
00:31:51,212 --> 00:31:53,180
You need to stop looking. Do you understand?

481
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,516
She's alive? Does that mean she's a--

482
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:58,185
Elena, he's under a compulsion.

483
00:31:58,252 --> 00:31:59,920
Do you understand? Yes. I do.

484
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:01,321
Good.

485
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,293
I'm done now.

486
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,953
Come on. Let's get out of here.

487
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:30,459
37649. That's me.

488
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:31,693
Congratulations.

489
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:38,600
And bachelor number 5, damon salvatore.

490
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:46,374
37552. Would you look at that. 37552.

491
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:48,376
What are the chances? Me.

492
00:32:49,712 --> 00:32:53,482
- Where'd he go?
- I'm gonna call you later.

493
00:32:58,121 --> 00:33:00,322
I think it's time to let
this vampire crap go.

494
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:03,825
I mean, the research, the trips,
it's become an obsession.

495
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:05,293
Well, this is important to me, rick.

496
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:06,628
Why? Why is it so important?

497
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:10,031
Explain it to me. I mean, make me understand.

498
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:16,104
I mean, what's the point of this?

499
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:19,174
You don't want kids. You're barely ever home.

500
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:20,275
I just want us to be normal people.

501
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:21,843
Maybe I don't want to.

502
00:33:21,911 --> 00:33:26,982
Maybe I want more.

503
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:34,456
Here we go. Home, sweet home.

504
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:36,191
Wait. Why--why are we back here?

505
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:39,194
I wasn't ready to leave. Yeah, you were, mom.

506
00:33:42,465 --> 00:33:45,801
You're the best, matty. I know.

507
00:33:45,868 --> 00:33:52,274
I'm--I'm sorry... I was gone so long.

508
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:57,078
Why are you really home, mom?

509
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,652
It's pete. He's gone,

510
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:07,022
And it's all my fault.
I did it. I always do it.

511
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:10,192
No, you didn't, mom. It's not your fault.

512
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:18,300
You're all I have left.

513
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:25,841
Please don't leave me.
I'm not goin' anywhere.

514
00:34:48,397 --> 00:34:50,866
Are you really this stupid?

515
00:34:56,372 --> 00:34:57,973
Guess so.

516
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,683
You gonna put down the stake?

517
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:13,288
Wow. That's courage. Where's isobel?

518
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:15,690
What have you done to my wife?

519
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:18,526
You want me to tell you I killed her?
Would that make you happy?

520
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:19,861
Because I think you know what happened.

521
00:35:19,929 --> 00:35:23,632
I saw you feeding on her. Yeah.
I did, and I wasn't lying.

522
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:26,801
She was delicious.

523
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:32,707
Oh, come on. What do you think happened?

524
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:33,808
Not an inkling?

525
00:35:33,876 --> 00:35:36,578
Never considered the possibility?

526
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:42,317
I turned her. Why?

527
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:45,854
She came to me, all pathetic,
Looking for vampires.

528
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:49,024
There was something about her,
Something I liked.

529
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:52,160
There was something special.
You turned her because you liked her?

530
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:54,129
No, I slept with her because I liked her.

531
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,665
I turned her because she begged me to.

532
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:01,603
Yeah. But you knew that, too, didn't you?

533
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:04,239
Hmm. I guess she wasn't happy at home,

534
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:06,908
Wasn't happy with life in general,

535
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:11,913
Wasn't happy with you. Gaah!

536
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:15,417
Ah, this is a shame.

537
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:18,586
We're kindred spirits,
abandoned by the women we love.

538
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:23,458
Unrequited love sucks.

539
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:25,627
Sounds like I got a lung.

540
00:36:25,695 --> 00:36:27,862
Which means I get to sit
here and watch you die.

541
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:18,551
What happened? What did you do?

542
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:23,289
- Dude, what? He attacked me.
- Damon.

543
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:26,826
All I did was tell him the truth.
His wife didn't want him anymore.

544
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:29,329
It's not my fault he couldn't handle it.

545
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:30,497
Like you've been handling katherine?

546
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:36,169
I'm handling it fine. You know what?

547
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:38,972
Isobel came to me. She found me.

548
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,540
And if she's related to elena,

549
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:42,242
That means she's related to katherine.

550
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:45,512
Maybe katherine sent her to me.

551
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:48,548
Stop it. You don't have to keep looking.

552
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:51,150
Can't be a coincidence isobel sought me out.

553
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:56,789
Can't. I'm assuming you'll take care of this.

554
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:30,823
What happened? What's going on?

555
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:36,062
You were just... Did damon turn you?

556
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:42,168
No. I went for him, And then he stabbed me.

557
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,671
No, no, no. You must have
vampire blood in your system.

558
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:45,772
Somebody slipped it to you.

559
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,076
No. It's... it's something else.

560
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:55,081
Then how? I...

561
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,521
Isobel. Surprise gifts aren't fair.

562
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,557
I always feel bad for not
getting you something.

563
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:10,563
Just open it. Oh,
that's a giant piece of jewelry.

564
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:14,300
I know. It's ridiculous.
Just tell people it's a family heirloom.

565
00:39:14,368 --> 00:39:17,337
Nobody questions that. Where'd you get this?

566
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:19,472
If I told you, you'd laugh at me.

567
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,575
But promise me that you'll always wear it.

568
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:25,878
It'll protect you from all the
things that go bump in the night.

569
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,982
A ring to ward off the demons, eh?

570
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:32,719
Consider it a-- a token of my love,

571
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:35,221
My affection, and if nothing else,

572
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,757
An apology for being so crazy.

573
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:40,593
Well, you were definitely crazy.

574
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,762
I'm selfish, and I'm obsessed,

575
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,731
And I'm a horrible wife.

576
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,700
But you love me anyway.

577
00:39:48,936 --> 00:39:51,137
Yes, I do.

578
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:55,608
This ring protected me.

579
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:04,984
That's impossible. I know.

580
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,024
Was there a problem?

581
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:50,630
Did you find her? What's going on?

582
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,967
Isobel?

583
00:41:21,628 --> 00:41:28,334
It's harper. I'm glad you found us.

584
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:32,872
Ms. Gibbons, This gentleman
is a friend of mine.

585
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,307
May he come in?

586
00:41:34,374 --> 00:41:36,275
Any friend of pearl's is a friend of mine.

587
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:39,011
Please do. Come in.

588
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:42,281
Annabelle, close the door, please.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,950
Previously, on "The Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,020
For over a century, I have lived in secret.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,150
Until now.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,150
I know the risk,

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,720
but I have to know her.

6
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,290
Elena. She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

7
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,190
What happened to your face?

8
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,190
It's nothing.

9
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,460
It didn't look like nothing.

10
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,230
Matty tells me you broke his heart.

11
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,770
- Mom.  - He found his rebound girl.

12
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,470
There's a tomb underneath the church.

13
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,470
You saved everyone in the church?

14
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,270
27 vampires, Damon.

15
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,340
You can't just bring them back.

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,220
It's Harper.

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,650
I'm glad you found us.

18
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,750
Annabelle, close the door, please.

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:48,750


20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:59,240


21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,280
Hey. Bouffin.

22
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,010
What are you guys watching?

23
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,920
You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time?

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,220
There are over 150 channels. It's called a remote control.

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,920
This button changes the channel.

26
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,720
Hold it like this.

27
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,680
Hmm.

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,980
Did you get enough, sweetheart?

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,140
For now.

30
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,750
Anna, are you hungry?

31
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,080
Do you want a little?

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,150
No. Thank you, Miss Givens.

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,390
Why don't you lay down for a while and get some rest?

34
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,220
She's fine.

35
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,890
Aren't you, Miss Givens?

36
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,960
Of course, I am.

37
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,670
I'm fine.

38
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,150
Hey, mom.

39
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,590
Mom.

40
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,260
Hey, mom.

41
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,370
What? I'm trying to sleep.

42
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,700
Uh, I was just making sure you were alive.

43
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,440
I'm sorry, sweetie,

44
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,540
it was a late night.

45
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,410
My head is throbbing.

46
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,710
Yeah,

47
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,740
I'd appreciate it

48
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,710
if you wouldn't bring the party home.

49
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,550
And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it, too.

50
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,950
It wasn't a party. It was one guy.

51
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,650
Don't be so judgey.

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Yeah, well I talked to Roberta at the grill

53
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,060
and there's still a bartending position open.

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,830
If you, uh, wanted to get a job.

55
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,530
Well, I figured she'd still be pissed

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,960
about the last time I work there.

57
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,830
I think she's desperate.

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,300
I'll check it out.

59
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,430
Yeah?

60
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,070
Don't act so surprised.

61
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,100
Well, I mean, I just...

62
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,170
I didn't know how long

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,640
you planned on sticking around.

64
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,840
Well,there's back grant due.

65
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,610
It's back in everything, mom.

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,850
I guess, then, I'll check it out.

67
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,920
Who's that?

68
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,720
That's Caroline.

69
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,720
Ecch.

70
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,950
Easy.

71
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,690
Yeah, come in.

72
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,560
Hi, Mrs. Donovan.

73
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,270
I, uh, ok, well, 

74
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,670
we're gonna be late,

75
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,800
So, let's just get going.

76
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,310
Yeah.

77
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,740
Hi. How are you?

78
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,310
Good.

79
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,640
Damon hasn't said a word to me.

80
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,640
Every time I try to talk to him,

81
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,580
- He shuts me down. - Do you think

82
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,580
He's still trying to find Katherine?

83
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,650
I don't know.

84
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,480
He waited 145 years,

85
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,290
only to find out that Katherine could not care less.

86
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,550
I mean, that's gotta hurt, right?

87
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,820
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.

88
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,230
You have every reason to be upset with him.

89
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,330
- Mm-hmm.  - Have you thought any more

90
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,390
about what you're going to do?

91
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,400
About what?

92
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,530
Isabel, my vampire birth mother,

93
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,730
who's related to my vampire ancestor Katherine,

94
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,470
who screwed over your vampire brother?

95
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,470
Nah. Haven't thought about it at all.

96
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,910
I'm sorry I brought it up.

97
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
It'd just be nice

98
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,740
if we could get through one day

99
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,810
without having to deal with any of it.

100
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,610
No vampire mother or brother.

101
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,350
No vampires at all?

102
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,450
No vampires but you.

103
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,720
I just want to get us back to normal stuff

104
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,920
like school.

105
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,890
And homework.

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,320
And here's a thought.

107
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,590
Fun.

108
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,590
Ooh, that sounds good to me.

109
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,590
When do we start?

110
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,330
We can watch a movie at my place.

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,930
Uh, with your mom?

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,270
And a 6-pack?

113
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,170
You know, you don't really help the situation.

114
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,470
You could at least try to be nice.

115
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

116
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,610
It's hard for me to show kindness

117
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,970
to people that hate me.

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,710
I'm not that evolved.

119
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,620
So, what movie tonight?

120
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,820
Whatever you want to do is fine by me.

121
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,020
But I'm late and I gotta go, ok?

122
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,620
Ok.

123
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,630
And the keypad is for texting,

124
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,170
which is what you do when you want to avoid talking to someone.

125
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,270
Anna, it's Jeremy,

126
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
I haven't heard from you for a while.

127
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,970
I'm not stalking you. 

128
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,240
Have a good day. I am...

129
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,640
I didn't break it, I swear.

130
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,840
I was just showing Harper what you taught me.

131
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,080
What a marvelous device.

132
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,710
Who was that?

133
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,320
Jeremy Gilbert.

134
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,350
Is that your boyfriend?

135
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,790
Of course not.

136
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,420
Uh, what do you think?

137
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,660
You're very respectable.

138
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,660
That's the goal.

139
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,860
I can't say that I miss corsets.

140
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,330
Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys

141
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,330
- and her ATM card.  - What's that?

142
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,470
I'll explain later.

143
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,200
Where are you going?

144
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,670
We have some business in town.

145
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,270
We'll be back as soon as we can.

146
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,410
I trust that you'll keep an eye on things.

147
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,710
So, I'm the babysitter now.

148
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
Frederick.

149
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,080
If this is going to work,

150
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,280
we have to cooperate with one another.

151
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,350
So you say.

152
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,450
I'll watch things, Miss Pearl.

153
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,320
Thank you, Harper.

154
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,390
I'm thinking nothing huge,

155
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,730
just dinner at the grill,

156
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,930
Maybe late movie.

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,960
You mean like a double date?

158
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,000
2 pair out on a friday night,

159
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,970
Coupled.

160
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,330
Yeah, a double date.

161
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,800
Do you think that's a good idea?

162
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,100
Why not?

163
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,570
You know, we all haven't gone out together before

164
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,140
and I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us.

165
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,080
Like, the couple dynamics have changed,

166
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,410
and there's been a little awkwardness

167
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,620
between you, Matt and me,

168
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,550
and I just think it's important

169
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,390
that we get over it.

170
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,720
- I don't know.  - You know wha...

171
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,120
I... I think that sounds like a great idea.

172
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,860
- You do?  - Yeah.

173
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,200
Yeah, a nice evening out with friends.

174
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,730
Sounds fun.

175
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,330
As in fun.

176
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Hmm?

177
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,400
A double date it is.

178
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,770
Ok.

179
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,870
So, we will see you tonight.

180
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,010
- Ok.  - Ok.

181
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,510
Ok.

182
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,370
Hello, Damon.

183
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,470
Ever hear of knocking?

184
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,700
An invitation wasn't necessary.

185
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,740
I'm surprised that no living person resides here.

186
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,280
Is it just you and your brother?

187
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,110
Yeah.

188
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,250
But he keeped out all walking vampires.

189
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,180
Killed 'em.

190
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,350
Unh!

191
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,360
Damn!

192
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,790
Have a seat, Damon.

193
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,400
I was hoping we could have a word.

194
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,500
Sure.

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000


196
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,500


197
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800


198
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700


199
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,960


200
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Freak.

201
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160


202
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160


203
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,860


204
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,060


205
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,340
We've taken up residence

206
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,580
at a farm house just outside of town.

207
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,680
It'll suffice for now.

208
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,680
All 25 vampires?

209
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,180
Not all. Some.

210
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,920
I imagine that a few have already left town.

211
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,890
Others are probably still in the woods

212
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,220
or, like us, acclimating.

213
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,190
How'd they get out of the tomb?

214
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,190
I think the woods screwed up

215
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,830
that part of our hocus-pocus.

216
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,860
Ohh.

217
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,160
I understand from Anna

218
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,370
that the founding families still have a secret council?

219
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,570
And you're a part of it.

220
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,870
That's ridiculous.

221
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,100
I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet, Damon.

222
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,200
I'm up to speed.

223
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,610
So am I.

224
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,170
And now that you've infiltrated the council,

225
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,110
I'll need to know everything they know.

226
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,340
Starting with a list of names

227
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,180
of all the council members and their families.

228
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,110
And everyone you've supplied with vervain.

229
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,480
Yes, that will have to stop immediately.

230
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,950
What exactly are you trying to achieve?

231
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,360
Mystic Falls is our home, Damon.

232
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,720
They took that from us.

233
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,060
Our land, our home.

234
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,630
It's time we rebuild.

235
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,560
What, are you crazy?

236
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,300
That was 1864.

237
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,300
Wake up, woman.

238
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,470
The world has moved on.

239
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,540
As a reward for your help,

240
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm willing to give you what you want most.

241
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,740
I want nothing.

242
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,170
Katherine.

243
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,810
You wouldn't even know where she was.

244
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
You've been under the ground

245
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,050
for the last 1 1/2 centuries.

246
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,120
Katherine and I were best friends

247
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,990
long before we came to Mystic Falls, Damon.

248
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,120
I know how she thinks.

249
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,990
I know her patterns.

250
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,420
I know where to find her.

251
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,330
I no longer have any desire to see Katherine ever again.

252
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,530
And there's no way in hell

253
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm gonna play the role of your little minion.

254
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,970
I'm not asking for your help, Damon.

255
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,070
Finding Katherine

256
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,510
was just a mere gesture of kindness.

257
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,550
The rest is non-negotiable.

258
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,850
Aah!

259
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,250
Unh! Aah!

260
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,090
I have 400 years on you, little boy.

261
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,560
I'll rip you from limb to limb

262
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,030
without even blinking and you know it.

263
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,630
I'll be in touch.

264
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,030
You got me flowers.

265
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,160
Well, I figured it's a date,

266
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,160
Why not do right?

267
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,430
Aww.

268
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,770
I would have driven, too,

269
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,470
But you're the one with the car.

270
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,200
You know, you'd think that for someone who was around

271
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,140
when the car was invented,

272
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,740
that you'd have one.

273
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,910
Oh, I have one.

274
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,440
I just never drive it.

275
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,980
You know, it's not too late to cancel.

276
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,520
Why would we do that?

277
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,580
I don't know.

278
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,220
It just seems surreal.

279
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,420
Like maybe we weren't meant

280
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,290
to get to the normal part.

281
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,330
That's exactly why we're going to do it.

282
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,590
We're going to go out,

283
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,130
have some fun,

284
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,370
and try to remember that we don't have to be so serious.

285
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,100
Listen, when I decided to stay here

286
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,300
and to get to know you,

287
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,710
it was so that I could do things like this.

288
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,310
I could bring my girlfriend flowers,

289
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,140
take her out on a date,

290
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,180
try to be normal.

291
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,550
Have you ever even been on a double date before?

292
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,450
Oh, absolutely.

293
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,290
Um, 72. Heff and the twins.

294
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,460
What?

295
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,320
Yeah. Playmates. I gotta miss June.

296
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,160
Are you serious?

297
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
Miss Summers?

298
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,030
Yes. Hi, Pearl.

299
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,730
Hi. This is my daughter Annabelle.

300
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Of course. Jeremy's friend.

301
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,170
Nice to see you, Miss Sommers.

302
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,840
Oh, Jenna, please.

303
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,010
This property was in

304
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,510
my brother-in-law's family for generations.

305
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,410
It's one of the original structures in Mystic Falls.

306
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,550
Used to be one of those old-fashioned drug store thingies.

307
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,850
You mean an apothecary?

308
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
- Yeah.  - You don't say.

309
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,750
Sorry, if it's musty.

310
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,190
No one's been in here for quite some time.

311
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,390
I'll use my imagination.

312
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,060
Annabelle.

313
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,390
Coming, mother.

314
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,570
What's with the glasses inside?

315
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,740
My, uh,

316
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,640
ah, my eyes are a little sensitive today.

317
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,010
You're new around here.

318
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,620
Oh, in the country, I'm very old.

319
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,980
Bourbon neat.

320
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,620
I haven't been gone that long.

321
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,520
I would remember someone who looked like you.

322
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,620
Yeah? Where'd you go?

323
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,630
Around, about.

324
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,230
Been there.

325
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,460
I love to see a man drown his sorrows.

326
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,160
It's so sexy.

327
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,770
It's more like nursing my wounds.

328
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,230
And you?

329
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,600
I was supposed to be interviewing for the bartender job,

330
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,840
But, um, I think the manager blew me off.

331
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,240
Well, that's not very nice.

332
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,780
Yeah. Last time I was in town,

333
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,180
I slept with her boyfriend.

334
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,400
Well, that's not very nice, either.

335
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,400
- But it happens.  - Yes, it does.

336
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,340
Kelly?

337
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,670
Kelly Donovan.

338
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,640
Jen!

339
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,950
I heard you were back in town

340
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,250
You used to babysit me

341
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,120
And then, I used to party with her.

342
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,720
This woman was crazy.

343
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,180
Not as crazy as you.

344
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,620
Ha, not anymore.

345
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,550
Well, sit, drink.

346
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,360
Uh, I shouldn't.

347
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,230
I'm responsible now, haven't you heard?

348
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,890
Then take a night off. It's good for the soul.

349
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,260
Great for the soul.

350
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,200
Oh, well.

351
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,370
This is not gonna end well.

352
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,900
Can't wait.

353
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,200
Whoo!

354
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,150
- I hate this house.  - This is better than the tomb.

355
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,350
I didn't stay locked up until 145 years

356
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,750
then end up locked up here.

357
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,650
Maybe you should quit complaining.

358
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,390
You gonna stop me?

359
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,090
Let it be, Frederick.

360
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,030
You heard what Pearl said.

361
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,700
I don't care what Pearl said.

362
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,570
What you got, boy?

363
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,370
Try that again.

364
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,680
Back off.

365
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,610
Back off.

366
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,080
We don't fight each other. Those are the rules.

367
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,150
And I'm tired of your rules.

368
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,080
I want out of this house.

369
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,280
Why can't we go in town?

370
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,420
Eventually.

371
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,890
But for now, we have to keep a low profile.

372
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,290
No one knows who I am.

373
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,620
The Salvatore brothers do.

374
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,860
And I wish hell I could run into them.

375
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,030
They're the reason we were caught in the first place.

376
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,970
So, uh, Matt, how do you like working here?

377
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,230
Uh, it's not that bad.

378
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,340
Wait staff comes out pretty good.

379
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,310
You know, they can't keep a bartender to save their lives.

380
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,480
I actually put my mom up for the job.

381
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,080
How's that been

382
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,550
having Kelly back?

383
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,610
You know, the same old Kelly.

384
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,650
She's, uh, she's trying, sort of.

385
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,520
Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up.

386
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,620
That's how Matt and I first met.

387
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,720
Shared a crib together.

388
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,950
You're kidding.

389
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,660
No, we've, uh, known each other our whole lives.

390
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,600
Ok.

391
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,900
Whoo!

392
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,970
You gotta be kidding me.

393
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,970
Oh my god. It's big Jenna now.

394
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,880
Where are you going?

395
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,020
Bethanne and I are going out for a bit.

396
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,180
Hit the town. Kick up our heels.

397
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,920
But we're not supposed to leave.

398
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,220
Miss Pearl made that very clear.

399
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,330
You gonna stop me?

400
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,630
I didn't think so.

401
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,690
- Anna.  - Surprised?

402
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,630
I, uh, I thought you and your mom were leaving town.

403
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Oh, change of plans.

404
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,100
I'm sorry. I thought you'd be psyched.

405
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,770
No! No, no, I mean, I am.

406
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,940
Of course I am.

407
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,010
All right, then.

408
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,750
Step aside.

409
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,090
Don't be grumpy.

410
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,120
It can't be that bad.

411
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,760
You'd be surprised.

412
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,090
My primary reason for existence has abandoned me

413
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,630
and, after today's events,

414
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,030
the remains of the shaky ground that I walk on

415
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,530
are about to go kaboom.

416
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,740
Let's get hammered.

417
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,310
Let's.

418
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,750
Whoo!

419
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,250
At least they're having fun.

420
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,050
They're drunk.

421
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,790
Remember when Elena's parents busted us here

422
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,060
after homecoming?

423
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,560
Oh, my god, yes!

424
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,560
We were wasted.

425
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,590
It was the first time I ever got drunk.

426
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,130
I blame Matt.

427
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,360
Her parents got seated at the next booth.

428
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,430
Oh, and Matt had me pretend that I was choking

429
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,230
so we could get away.

430
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,330
Except her dad was a doctor,

431
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,770
so, he jumped up to save her.

432
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,740
And I ran and slipped on the wet floor

433
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,840
and bit it.

434
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,210
In front of everyone.

435
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,210
Do you remember that?

436
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,910
3 stitches, a hangover for days,

437
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,240
and I was grounded from seeing this one for a week.

438
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,750
Well, I'm gonna go to the restroom.

439
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,890
Elena?

440
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,090
Quick, hide.

441
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,260
We're not here.

442
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,690
Why? Where'd we go?

443
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,960
Children under our care at 5:00 p.m.

444
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,730
This is not role modelish.

445
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,470
Kelly, damn.

446
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,300
Ohh!

447
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,900
Ok, so, uh, what made you and your mom

448
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,570
decide to stay in town?

449
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,510
Oh, she got this business opportunity.

450
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,670
She's gonna open up a little store.

451
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,680
It's always been her dream.

452
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,980
So, yeah, we're staying.

453
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,310
And I'm thinking about going back to highschool.

454
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,380
So, you'll be seeing a lot more of me.

455
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,380
Oh, yeah?

456
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,720
Enough of home schooling.

457
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,020
You know? I'd like to be a normal teen for once.

458
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,020
But I have to ask my mom first.

459
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,290
She'll have an opinion.

460
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,420
Yeah, well, I wish you were there now.

461
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,130
I actually have to write another paper.

462
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,860
I was thinking about squeezing one more out

463
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,100
on the vampires of Mystic Falls.

464
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,560
Really?

465
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,000
Haven't you exhausted the subject?

466
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,770
No. No, I want to go deeper, you know?

467
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,470
I want to understand why people were labeled as vampires

468
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,610
back in the day.

469
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,210
I mean, maybe there is such a thing as vampires.

470
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,480
They're just different from the way we always thought they were.

471
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,980
What do you mean?

472
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,010
Well, uh,

473
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,650
Maybe they're normal and good,

474
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,150
just outsiders, you know?

475
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,990
Um, misunderstood.

476
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,360
You're kidding, right?

477
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,360
Don't you think it could be possible?

478
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,030
You did give me all that info.

479
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,430
Jeremy, I made it up, ok?

480
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,940
I mean, you were all cute and fluffy

481
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,670
and I wanted to make a good impression.

482
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,510
Is there anything you're not good at?

483
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,480
Double dating.

484
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,720
This is all kinda new to me.

485
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,290
I usually keep to myself.

486
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,650
I don't always fit in.

487
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,190
That's because you're that guy.

488
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,960
What guy?

489
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,590
The guy who seems like he has everything.

490
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,930
So, the people who don't kinda run the other way.

491
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,300
Is that what I seem like?

492
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,700
Pretty much.

493
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,870
Hmm.

494
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,870
What a dick.

495
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,510
Yeah.

496
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,910
Yeah.

497
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,850
So, um,

498
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,680
What are you doing?

499
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,020
What?

500
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,120
Well, the point of this

501
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,520
was to show him how much you care about Stefan.

502
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,060
You're not to hopscotch down memory lane.

503
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,860
I was just trying to make conversation.

504
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,600
Well, try less.

505
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,400
Caroline.

506
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,070
Katherine.

507
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,210
I'm sorry. You have the wrong person.

508
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,510
Elena, come on.

509
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,080
My mistake.

510
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,960
How's everything going?

511
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,990
Matt's cheating.

512
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,300
No need. I'm awesome. 

513
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,470
Stefan Salvatore.

514
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,700
Is everying ok?

515
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,330
Everything's great.

516
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,550


517
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,090
So you haven't seen him before?

518
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,400
No, there was nothing from her.

519
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,000
There wasn't at all.

520
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,470
All right. Let's call it a night.

521
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,200
You know? Send Matt and Caroline home?

522
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,900
You know, the whole point of tonight

523
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,000
was to not have to deal with this stuff.

524
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,670
We need to get through one night.

525
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,840
One normal night.

526
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,680
You sure?

527
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,220
No, I'm not sure.

528
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,180
But I don't know what else to do.

529
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,750
Look, if there's another vampire in town,

530
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,520
he'll still be here tomorrow.

531
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,960
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

532
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,360
Ok.

533
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,830
Oh, it's them.

534
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,570
Come here.

535
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,280
Yeah.

536
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,380
Uh, yeah, this is much better

537
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,250
than watching "Damon Visit Cougar Town."

538
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,180
No offense.

539
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,210
Don't remind me.

540
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Man, I've always wanted to see

541
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,250
what it looks like in this place.

542
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,590
Yeah, I guess it's, uh,

543
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,290
a bit much.

544
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,290
Yeah, my entire house could fit in here, like, twice.

545
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,090
I feel like I've been here before.

546
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,460
It's weird.

547
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,900
Do you guys wanna watch a movie or something?

548
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,230
Whoa, these are great.

549
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,100
That's, uh,

550
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,300
just a little hobby of mine.

551
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,210
I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9.

552
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,340
You like cars?

553
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,410
That's an understatement.

554
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,610
Come with me.

555
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,780
So, the thing about cherries,

556
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,480
you have to.

557
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,220
Oh, my goodness.

558
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,990
That's amazing. You were quick.

559
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,060
And that would be my cue.

560
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,400
You've giving up already?

561
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,430
Oh, yeah.

562
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,000
See you guys.

563
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,010
Prepare yourself, my friend.

564
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,240
Ahem.

565
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,650
Whoa, wait.

566
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,750
How do you have this?

567
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,650
Got passed down rough the family.

568
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,360
Why don't...

569
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,460
I mean...

570
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,230
Why don't you drive it?

571
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,800
Well, it, uh, doesn't run.

572
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,160
I mean, it's not that I could figure out.

573
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,400
Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?

574
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,440
Be more of a girl right now.

575
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,770
Hey, why don't you

576
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,900
come take a look at this for me?

577
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,910
Elena, remember the old Camaro

578
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,140
your dad used to have?

579
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,810
Of course.

580
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,340
Hey, I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times.

581
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,280
Wow.

582
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,010
Well, I don't like sports cars.

583
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,680
They're too hard to make out in.

584
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,350
Nah, it wasn't that bad.

585
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,560
I'm sorry, man.

586
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,800
No, no.

587
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,060
Don't worry about it.

588
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,270
You and Elena, you guys have a history

589
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,600
and ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good.

590
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,810
She's good with you.

591
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,580
You know, I wasn't sure, but she's happy

592
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,240
and I'm glad.

593
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,550
All right. Let's take a look at this.

594
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,790
Ouch!

595
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,150
Damn it!

596
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,190
Need some help?

597
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,190
Damn it!

598
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,960
Stupid shoe.

599
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,360
Oh!

600
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,160
Gotta pick up your other foot.

601
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,830
Thanks.

602
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,770
Ahem.

603
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,040
There you go.

604
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,870
Thanks.

605
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,540
I think.

606
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,740
Was that Damon Salvatore you were with?

607
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,150
The one and only.

608
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,780
You know him?

609
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,550
We go way back.

610
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,250
He still live out by Miller Lane?

611
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,150
Uh, he lives in the old boarding house.

612
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,760
By Wickery Bridge.

613
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,990
He's still in there

614
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,760
if you wanna say "Hi."

615
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,030
I'd rather stay here and talk to you.

616
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,730
Ohh.

617
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,830
Nice.

618
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,100
Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt.

619
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,940
But I'm a little drunk.

620
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,280
And high guy plus drunk me equals very bad things.

621
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,680
No.

622
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,350
I'm pretty sure you'd like it.

623
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,730
Sorry.

624
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,560
That was a seriously lame pick-up.

625
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,130
I'm sorry.

626
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,200
That is a nice scent you're wearing.

627
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,100
What is it?

628
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,840
I don't know.

629
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,910
It was a gift.

630
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,210
And that is a cab, so.

631
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,220
Vervain.

632
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,160
Making it hard to find something to eat in this town.

633
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,630
- Caroline  - I don't want to talk about it.

634
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,360
You are being ridiculous.

635
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,970
And insecure and stupid,

636
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,200
but that doesn't change the fact

637
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,870
that Matt's always gonna be in love with you,

638
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,370
and I'm always gonna be the backup.

639
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,710
- You're not the backup.  - Yes, I am.

640
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,610
I'm Matt's Elena backup.

641
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,080
I'm your Bonnie backup.

642
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,940
Now it's about me and Bonnie?

643
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,990
You don't get it.

644
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,420
Why would you?

645
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,090
You're everyone's first choice.

646
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,400
Piece of cake. 

647
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,480
You know what?

648
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,210
Why don't you guys go ahead

649
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,310
and take it for a spin?

650
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,780
- Really?  - Yeah.

651
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,250
Caroline.

652
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
You all right?

653
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,710
If it's not vampires, it's girlfriends.

654
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,620
All right. Roast beef, turkey.

655
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,820
What do you want?

656
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,890
Oh, let's do the works.

657
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,890
Pile it high.

658
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,950
All right. I like your style.

659
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,560
Will you grab the bread for me?

660
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,960
Ok.

661
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
Ohh!

662
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,070
What are you doing?

663
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,170
It's just a cut.

664
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,570
Will you hand me that towel?

665
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,110
I... I... I can't.

666
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,940
You got a problem with blood, Anna?

667
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,080
What's matter?

668
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,260
It's just blood, Anna.

669
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,330
- What are you doing?  - I knew it.

670
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,230
Go for it.

671
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,280
Jeremy.

672
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,580
Jenna. Hey, what's, uh...

673
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,820
what's up?

674
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,520
Regret.

675
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,590
Make sure you lock that up.

676
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,080
Did I just pass their driveway?

677
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,380
Uh, I think it's up there.

678
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,590
This is an amazing car.

679
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,560
Did I pass?

680
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,100
The whole double date thing

681
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,770
was obviously a test

682
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,770
to see how I would do around Elena.

683
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,870
I don't know.

684
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,580
You were eminiscing

685
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,180
about the Elena years all night.

686
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:15,980
Caroline,

687
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,580
that stuff came before, ok?

688
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,320
It's not just gonna go away.

689
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,580
I know that, ok?

690
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,520
No. No, you don't.

691
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,290
Because you're letting it turn you into a crazy person.

692
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,660
Look, it's my fault.

693
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,660
I, you know, I made it pretty clear early on

694
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:38,540
that Elena still means something to me.

695
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,470
But all that talk,

696
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,240
that was just

697
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,240
2 old friends and some memories.

698
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,280
Tonight wasn't about me and Elena.

699
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,080
I was there

700
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,050
because I wanted to be with you.

701
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,850
And I don't know what this means

702
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,520
or what we are,

703
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,460
but I do know that you're the only person

704
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,430
I want to be in this car with right now.

705
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,830
I don't even know if this makes sense,

706
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,770
because I'm not really that good at expressing myself.

707
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,370
No, no.

708
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:17,010
I think you're doing just fine.

709
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,660
Ow!

710
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
Sports cars. 

711
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,830
- Yeah.  - Hmm.

712
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,270
Kelly, well.

713
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,780
Now that you've got me here.

714
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,180
What are you gonna do with me?

715
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,990
I'm going to...

716
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,690
going to do this.

717
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,310
Ohh!

718
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,980
Mom?

719
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,680
Damon?

720
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,020
Oh, my god. Matt.

721
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,650
Oh, my god.

722
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,930
- I gotta...  - It's fine. Just go.

723
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,370
I... I'll take her home.

724
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,700
Thanks, man.

725
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,690
Where have you been?

726
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,520
Um, I needed some air.

727
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,060
For 3 hours?

728
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,190
Tell me. Where have you been?

729
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,530
Out.

730
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,860
I was out.

731
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,730
Annabelle, don't do this.

732
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,970
I can't fight you, too.

733
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,870
What?

734
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,910
I'm sorry.

735
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,550
Sorry I'm bailing.

736
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,360
Just wish you'd let me drive you home.

737
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,060
Normal people don't have chaperones or bodyguards

738
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,430
or babysitters.

739
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,890
We're normal tonight, remember?

740
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,160
I know, I just get so worried about you.

741
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,130
Stefan, I can't live every minute

742
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,130
afraid that someone's gonna come after me.

743
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,270
I won't.

744
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,740
That's not living.

745
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,370
Ok.

746
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
Call me when you get home safe?

747
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,440
- Mm... hmm.  - Ok.

748
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,710
- Bye, Stefan.  - Bye.

749
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,020
Don't look at me like that.

750
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,120
Are you crazy?

751
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,250
Save the lecture. Look...

752
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,660
Aah!

753
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:05,020


754
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:15,020


755
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,200
Damn it.

756
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,670
Aah.

757
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,540
I remember them.

758
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,240
From 1864.

759
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,480
They were in the tomb.

760
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,440
Yeah.

761
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,750
About that.

762
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,170
Matt

763
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,170
Matt...

764
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,910
I don't wanna hear it, mom.

765
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,140
Look.

766
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,240
Matty, please.

767
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,680
Do you know what I was doing tonight, mom?

768
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,110
I was having fun.

769
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,520
You know, trying to forget

770
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,050
about all the crap that I have to deal with every day?

771
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Just enjoy a night with my friends.

772
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,620
And then, there you are.

773
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,930
Wasted at the bar,

774
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,960
where I work, by the way.

775
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:35,000
To pay the bills that you don't pay.

776
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,770
And then you're off acting like a freaking kid?

777
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,870
Hookin' up with some guy half your age.

778
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,110
I'm the kid, mom.

779
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,810
You're supposed to be responsible for me.

780
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,080
I know, Matt.

781
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,610
How was your night?

782
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,610
Oh, same old, as old. You?

783
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,750
Yep.

784
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,760
So where is Bethanne?

785
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,620
She won't be coming back.

786
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,220
What happened? where is she?

787
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,860
Well, you were right.

788
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,030
We shouldn't have left.

789
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,890
No.

790
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,000
You hungry?

791
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,710
Unh!

792
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,490
Next time, you'll listen to me.

793
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,330
I'm home.

794
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,790
Teeth brushed, ready for bed.

795
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,000
Safe and sound.

796
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,530
Oh, good. I'm glad.

797
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,870
Is everything all right?

798
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,830
You sound serious.

799
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,270
no, no, no.

800
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,470
Uh, not tonight.

801
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,440
You still have a few more minutes left of normal.

802
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,680
I'll pay you back tomorrow, ok?

803
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,550
I had a really nice time on our date tonight.

804
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,490
Such a liar.

805
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,550
No, I'm serious.

806
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,920
In a way, it was exactly what it was supposed to be.

807
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,530
I had really nice time, too.

808
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,840
Could you help me out a little bit?

809
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,440
What the hell?

810
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,580
I could have killed you.

811
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,350
Yeah, but you didn't.

812
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,050
I should have.

813
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,490
But you didn't.

814
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,220
How did you know?

815
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,360
I knew this girl, Vicki.

816
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,730
She, uh,

817
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,930
she was attacked by an animal,

818
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,070
a bite on the neck.

819
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,030
She started acting crazy.

820
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,040
You know, weird,

821
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,040
and it... and it seemed like drugs,

822
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,970
but then, you showed me those arties.

823
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,280
And then, I saw your face.

824
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,010
And how it changed.

825
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,540
That night in the cemetery when I kissed you.

826
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,940
Look.

827
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,440
You know you can't tell anyone, right?

828
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,350
Ha. Who'd believe me?

829
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,710
You'd be surprised.

830
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,790
Why didn't you?

831
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,950
Kill me?

832
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,960
I don't know.

833
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,960
Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you.

834
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,660
Like what?

835
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,000
Lost.

836
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,380
Why would you confront me about it? why would you risk it?

837
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,420
Because if it was true maybe,

838
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,560
maybe it's true about Vicki.

839
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,660
And also because...

840
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,970
I want you to turn me????????????????????????????????????????????????1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:01,501
Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,982
For over a century,
I have lived in secret

3
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:05,779
Until now. I know the risk.

4
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:07,146
But I have to know her.

5
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:08,781
There's a tomb
underneath the church.

6
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:11,317
A spell sealed Katherine in
that tomb, protecting her.

7
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:12,418
I'm gonna bring her back.

8
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,487
She's not there!

9
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:16,188
You saved everyone in the church?

10
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:18,557
We've taken up residence in a
farmhouse just outside of town.

11
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:20,626
All 25 vampires? Some.

12
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:24,063
I hate this house. I didn't
stay locked up for 145 years

13
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,131
To end up locked up here.

14
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:26,666
Aah!

15
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:27,800
Ugh!

16
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:28,768
So, where's Bethanne?

17
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,169
She won't be coming back.

18
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,804
My wife Isobel spent her life

19
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:34,040
Researching paranormal
activity in this area.

20
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,908
What have you done to my wife?
I turned her.

21
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,344
Maybe there is such
a thing as vampires.

22
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:40,179
They're just different from the
way we always thought they were.

23
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,380
Aah!

24
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,748
You got a problem with blood, Anna?

25
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:44,050
Ahh!

26
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:45,351
I knew this girl Vicki.

27
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:47,386
She was attacked by an animal,
a bite to the neck.

28
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:48,487
And then I saw your face.

29
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:50,356
Why would you confront me about it?

30
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:51,624
Because maybe it's
true about Vicki.

31
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,793
And also because I
want you to turn me.

32
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:34,233
I love storms.

33
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,268
Is that a vampire thing?

34
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:38,437
'cause I read vampires
don't like running water.

35
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:39,839
It's only Dracula.

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,608
Yeah. He was a complete wuss.

37
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,710
Never showered. Very smelly.

38
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:46,112
Seriously?

39
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:49,448
First rule about vampires--

40
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:51,817
Don't believe anything you read.

41
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:54,620
You gotta tell me more.
I gotta know.

42
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:57,223
No, you don't.

43
00:01:57,224 --> 00:01:58,657
'cause you're not gonna be one.

44
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:00,025
Come on, you can't
keep saying "No" To me.

45
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,727
Look, I'm not gonna turn someone

46
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:04,930
Who learned everything he knows
about vampires from netflix.

47
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:06,932
That's not true, and you know it.

48
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:11,103
Why do you even want this?

49
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:12,838
Give me one good reason.

50
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:15,007
'cause I...

51
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:21,113
Hmm. Let me know when you
can finish that sentence.

52
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:27,186
Hey, you're still up.

53
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:28,521
Hey, what's up?

54
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:30,389
Looks like the there's
a big storm rolling in.

55
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,858
Can you help make sure all
the windows are closed?

56
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:34,794
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

57
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:49,074
We're running low on blood.

58
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:52,111
You might wanna send Anna to
the hospital for some more.

59
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:54,146
I'll send her out
for some tomorrow.

60
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:55,848
Maybe I could go with her.

61
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,115
If the storm keeps it dark enough,

62
00:02:57,115 --> 00:03:00,467
I might be able to go out
during the day, no sun and all.

63
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:01,554
I'm afraid not.

64
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:04,356
Not after your stunt at the
Salvatore house tonight.

65
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,891
He and his brother deserved it.

66
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:07,293
And where did that get you?

67
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:09,061
Your girlfriend Bethanne is dead.

68
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:11,564
And you have no one
to blame but yourself.

69
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,533
We cannot live our
lives about revenge.

70
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:17,536
We have to have better
control of our emotions.

71
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,605
I understand, miss Pearl.

72
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:22,374
I just wish I knew
what you were up to.

73
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,115
I'm going to make an exploratory
visit into town tomorrow

74
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:33,719
To assess who's under the influence
of vervain and who isn't.

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,889
Anna tells me that the
players haven't changed much.

76
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,791
It's still the Lockwoods,
the Forbes, the Fells--

77
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,426
We should kill every
last one of them.

78
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:43,562
We are smarter than that,
Frederick.

79
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:46,232
These people are not our enemies.

80
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,068
We don't hold grudges
and resentments.

81
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,036
We'll get our town back.

82
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:54,573
We just have to have patience.

83
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:07,653
You heard her.

84
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:10,155
No revenge.

85
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,257
Patience.

86
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:13,959
Self-control.

87
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:20,766
She seems to have it all
figured out, doesn't she?

88
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:34,480
I say we go to Pearl's,
bust down the door,

89
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,482
And annihilate the idiot
that attacked us last night.

90
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,365
Yeah. And then what?

91
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,351
We turn to the rest of
that house of vampires

92
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,886
And say, "Oops. Sorry?"

93
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,354
I can't believe you
made a deal with her.

94
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:45,858
It was more like a helpful
exchange of information.

95
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:49,328
And it's not like a choice
 She's...

96
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,663
Scary.

97
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,666
Besides, she's gonna help
me get Katherine back.

98
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,134
Of course she is.

99
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,535
Damon gets what he wants, as usual.

100
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,170
No matter who he
hurts in the process.

101
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:00,072
You don't have to
be snarky about it.

102
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:02,041
I woke up this morning

103
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,677
To learn that all the vampires
have been released from the tomb.

104
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:06,178
I've earned snarky.

105
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:08,647
How long are you going to blame me

106
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,983
For turning your birth
mother into a vampire?

107
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:12,551
I'm not blaming you, Damon.

108
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:14,820
I've accepted the fact that
you're a self-serving psychopath

109
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,121
With no redeeming qualities.

110
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:17,690
Ouch.

111
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:19,325
This isn't being very productive.

112
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:22,027
We're gonna figure out a way to deal
with Pearl and the vampires. Yeah?

113
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:24,129
Hmm.

114
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:29,535
I'm sorry. He just
makes me so cranky.

115
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,170
I know. He makes everybody cranky.

116
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,671
So, what are we going to do?

117
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:35,641
Damon and I are gonna handle
everything, I promise.

118
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:36,942
Well, what about me?

119
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,243
I can't just sit
here and do nothing.

120
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:39,678
That's exactly what
you're gonna do,

121
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,146
Because that's what
going to keep you safe.

122
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,882
Which means nothing if
you're not safe, too.

123
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,250
What do you mean?
I'm perfectly safe.

124
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:48,620
I have Damon, the self-serving
psychopath on my side.

125
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:51,023
Well, that's comforting.

126
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,398
Ok. We have some time.

127
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,899
I'm not meeting my mom until later.

128
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,935
Wait. Does your mom
know you're a...

129
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,436
The fact that you would
even think it's possible

130
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:06,405
To keep something like that a
secret from your own family

131
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:08,440
Is just further proof
that you're not ready.

132
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:10,476
"Not ready" Is a step up from "No."

133
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:12,678
And a million steps
down from "Maybe."

134
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:17,082
I like your bracelet.

135
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,018
Thanks. My sister got it for me.

136
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,420
Can I see it?

137
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:22,454
Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:29,495
Your sister doesn't know you're
hanging out with me, does she?

139
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:32,031
No. No. But I don't see
why it would be a problem.

140
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:33,899
It's not like she
knows what you are.

141
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,769
I'd rather keep it
our little secret.

142
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:42,608
You know, why don't you...
why don't you keep this?

143
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,611
Why would you give this to me?

144
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:50,149
Because. You like it.
And I like you.

145
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,985
You only like me because
of what you want from me.

146
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:55,721
No. I...I like you.

147
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,195
Um...

148
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:05,431
You know, you should wear it.

149
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,666
It looks better on you anyway.

150
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:12,771
I yelled at my mom last night.

151
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:16,375
You know, I feel like the
parent and the screwed-up kid.

152
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:17,843
Maybe she needed to hear it.

153
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,845
Yeah, but just... I worry
that if I push too hard,

154
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,447
Then she will take off again.

155
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:23,015
'cause that's her M.O.

156
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:26,785
Just like Vicki, who I haven't
heard from since she left.

157
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,454
Well, you can't control
your mom, Matt,

158
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,689
Any more than you can
control your sister.

159
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,492
I wish that she would just
try a little. You know?

160
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,928
If she would just try to try,
that'd be ok.

161
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:37,663
Maybe she'll surprise you.

162
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:40,199
People have a tendency to do that.

163
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:46,472
I should go before the roads
get even worse from the storm.

164
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:49,141
Yeah. Are you sure you
should be driving right now?

165
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:52,945
I have to. It's my dad's
boyfriend's daughter's birthday.

166
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:56,014
We have a non-traditional
traditional ritual.

167
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:59,284
Well, buckle up. Don't speed.

168
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:00,986
Stay off your cell phone.

169
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:02,654
And call me when you get there.

170
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:05,324
Got it. Anything else?

171
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:06,492
Yes.

172
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,030
Bye.

173
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,365
Bye.

174
00:08:19,772 --> 00:08:21,240
Hunting party?

175
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,242
That guy did a number on me
last night when he stabbed me.

176
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:24,710
I gotta get my strength back up.

177
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,712
I've got 2 liters of
soccer mom in the fridge.

178
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:28,881
No?

179
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:32,184
We'll talk when I get back?

180
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:34,820
All right. Give my
regards to the squirrels.

181
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:54,006
Aah!

182
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,126
You're ignoring me

183
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:15,989
The 6 missed calls? Sorry.
My phone is dead.

184
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,365
Is Stefan here? No.

185
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,432
Why?

186
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,295
Something wrong?

187
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:21,900
He went out to the woods
and didn't come back.

188
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,965
I can't get him on his phone.

189
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:26,072
I figured he was here with you.

190
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,541
It's going straight to voicemail.

191
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,948
Where could he be?

192
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:33,246
You're not going to
like what I'm thinking.

193
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,976
Pearl! Open this door.

194
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,712
I swear to God I'll bust
through and rip your head off.

195
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,214
Pearl's not home.

196
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,852
Hmm. Beautiful weather.

197
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,388
Not a ray of sun in the sky.

198
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,856
Where's my brother?

199
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,659
Billy.

200
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,700
You're dead. Whoa. I'm sorry.

201
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,836
You haven't been invited in.

202
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,204
Miss Gibbons?

203
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,106
Yes, Frederick honey?

204
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,475
Never let this bad man in.

205
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,077
I'll never let him in.

206
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,414
Ugh!

207
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,349
145 years left starving in a tomb,

208
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,253
Thanks to Katherine's infatuation
with you and your brother.

209
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,988
First few weeks,

210
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,458
Every single nerve in your
body screams with fire.

211
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,028
The kind of pain that
can drive a person mad.

212
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,863
Well...

213
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,365
I thought your brother might've
wanted to get a taste of that

214
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,768
Before I killed him. Billy.

215
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,703
Uhh!

216
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,539
Aah!

217
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,541
You have a nice day.

218
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,154
What happened? Where is he?

219
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,422
They have him. I can't get in.

220
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:57,756
Why not?

221
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,191
Because the woman
that owns the house

222
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,693
Is compelled to not let me in.

223
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,461
I can get in.

224
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,629
You're not going in there.

225
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,863
I'm going! You're not going there.

226
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,167
Why are they doing this?
What do they want with him?

227
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,836
Revenge. They want revenge.

228
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,705
We gotta do something.

229
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,139
I know.

230
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,607
We can't let them hurt him.
We gotta get him out of there.

231
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,143
I know. Elena, I know.

232
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,279
But I don't know
how to get him out.

233
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,967
Vervain on the ropes.

234
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,705
Aah! Unh!

235
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,006
That's gotta sting.

236
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,577
Speaking of...

237
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,818
Aah!

238
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,687
This isn't right!

239
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,426
He killed Bethanne.

240
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,394
One of us, Harper.

241
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,370
And don't you think for a second

242
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:14,333
he wouldn't kill you
if he had the chance.

243
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,869
Pearl says we're not
here for revenge, right?

244
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,139
I say that's exactly
what we're here for.

245
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,611
Starting with this.

246
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,980
Aah! Aah!

247
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,150
And then his brother.

248
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,418
And anyone else that
gets in our way.

249
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,720
This isn't right!

250
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,455
You're gonna want to let go of me!

251
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,357
Miss Pearl will be home soon.

252
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,727
Miss Pearl is no longer in charge.

253
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,297
Tie him up! And then stake him down.

254
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,678
Well, don't you look... alive?

255
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,213
You can't hurt me.

256
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,048
Oh, I can hurt you, all right.

257
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,019
Mr. Saltzman.

258
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,356
We need your help.

259
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,025
Stefan's in the house.

260
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,360
Damon's a vampire.
He can't get in. We need you.

261
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,728
I would go, but--

262
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,131
Your life is valuable.

263
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,432
Yours, on the other hand...

264
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,568
Stefan told me about your ring.

265
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,602
What about it?

266
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,636
Let me recap...

267
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,371
You tried to kill me.
I defended myself.

268
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,673
You died.

269
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:28,841
Then according to my brother,

270
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,576
Your ring brought you back to life.

271
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,744
Am I leaving anything out?

272
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,247
Yeah. The part where I
try and kill you again.

273
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,915
Only this time, I don't miss.

274
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,317
Mr. Saltzman. Please.

275
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,518
It's Stefan.

276
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,256
I'm sorry, Elena.
But it's not my problem.

277
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,390
That's a shame.

278
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,558
Because the woman in
charge of the crowd

279
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,960
Can help you find your wife.

280
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,997
You're lying. Am I?

281
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,932
Why don't you ask her yourself?

282
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,301
Coward.

283
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,603
Come on, Elena.

284
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,443
All right! Wait.

285
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:08,865
I'll go.

286
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,184
So, I have an answer.

287
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,352
To what?

288
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,519
Why you should turn me.

289
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,288
We're back to that?

290
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:20,959
Look, I wake up every day,
and I feel ok,

291
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,761
But there's something missing.

292
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,197
Like a--like a hole.

293
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,000
Some people, they fit...
in life, or whatever.

294
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,768
I... I don't.

295
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,038
So, you want a pity-turn?

296
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,806
I don't think so.

297
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:39,611
You should turn me because
I don't have anything else.

298
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,717
Do you even know why
we turn other people?

299
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,788
It's not to give someone a one-way
ticket out of loner-hood. Ok?

300
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,724
One--we need someone
to do our dirty work.

301
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,493
Two, revenge.

302
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,729
Three, boredom... but, you know,
that never turns out well.

303
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,266
And then you know there's the obvious one.

304
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,371
You love someone so much
that you would do anything

305
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,840
To spend all of eternity with them.

306
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:16,782
Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't
fit any of those categories yet.

307
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,155
So, yeah. Just make sure
your thesis is clear,

308
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,090
And she'll love it.

309
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,792
See you later.

310
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,099
Mom, hey. Did you get everything?

311
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,468
Yeah, the blood-bank was understaffed
because of the rain.

312
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,936
I was in and out.

313
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,604
Who's that you were talking to?

314
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,440
A friend from the library.

315
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,674
Let's get home.

316
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,079
Hey, you're not going
out in that, are ya?

317
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,881
The roads are dangerous.
Route 5 is completely flooded.

318
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,750
We'll make do.

319
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,585
Mayor Lockwood,
we have your table ready.

320
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,020
Great.

321
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,588
Mayor... Lockwood, is it?

322
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,793
I suppose it is
treacherous outside.

323
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,562
My name is Pearl.

324
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,863
Hi.

325
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,865
This is my daughter Anna.

326
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,567
We've just recently moved to town.

327
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,104
Welcome. Richard Lockwood.
This is my son Tyler.

328
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,939
Please--please, join us.

329
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,009
It would be a pleasure.

330
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,114
Be more creepy, dad.

331
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,082
Not like your son is
standing right here.

332
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,985
Grow up. Elections are coming.

333
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,655
She's a constituent.
And a rich one, from the looks of it.

334
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,425
You can tell all that
by looking at her ass?

335
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,894
Awesome. I'm gonna
go shoot some pool.

336
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,768
Teacher by day,
vampire hunter by night.

337
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,971
I've you to thank for that.
What are these?

338
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,507
Those are tranquilizer
darts filled with vervain.

339
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,142
Just get me in.
I'll get Stefan out.

340
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,478
That's your plan? You're just
gonna take them all on yourself?

341
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,648
Well, I'll be a little
stealthier than that, hopefully.

342
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,083
Whoa. What are you doing?

343
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,284
I'm going with you guys.

344
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,520
No. No. No. No. No way.

345
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,422
You need me. I'll get in.

346
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,290
You could distract them,
and then I'll get Stefan out.

347
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,792
You'll get yourself killed.
You're not going in there.

348
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm going.

349
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,762
So, when you get me in,
get out as quickly as you can.

350
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,631
I know how to sneak around
where they can't hear me.

351
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,333
You'll basically
just be in the way.

352
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,669
Damon, now is not the time
to be the lone ranger.

353
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,838
Fine. Elena, you can
drive the getaway car.

354
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,540
You're not going in the house.

355
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,077
You can't stop me. It's Stefan
we're talking about here.

356
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,378
You don't understand.

357
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,780
Oh, I understand. I understand.

358
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,382
He's the reason you live.

359
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,852
His love lifts you up where
you belong. I get it.

360
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,821
Can you just not joke
around for 2 seconds?

361
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,622
I can't protect you, Elena.

362
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,691
I don't know how many
vampires there are in there.

363
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,561
That's how long it takes you
to get your head ripped off.

364
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,030
I have to be able to
get in and get out.

365
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,998
I can't be distracted
with your safety.

366
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,436
Or this will end up a bloodbath
that none of us walk away from...

367
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,371
Including Stefan.

368
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,076
I know.

369
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,645
I get it.

370
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,647
I understand.

371
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,152
If we're gonna go, let's go.

372
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,355
Where are you?
I can barely hear you.

373
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,492
Storm washed out Route 5.

374
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:25,087
Now I'm detoured on some
random backwoods path to hell.

375
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:26,587
Well, you shouldn't be
talking while you're driving.

376
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:28,199
I know, right?

377
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:30,748
I need one of those
bluetooth thingies.

378
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:32,272
Look, you're breaking up.

379
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:35,043
Just turn around and go
back the same way you came.

380
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:37,112
And watch the road. Ok?

381
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:37,592
Ok.

382
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,286
God.

383
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:54,025
Ohh.

384
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:02,769
Ohh. Seriously.

385
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,368
Oh, good, someone's home.

386
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:17,327
Uh, could I use your phone?

387
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:20,255
My--my car broke down a
few miles up the road.

388
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:21,763
This was the first house I saw.

389
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:23,419
Well, lucky you.

390
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,168
Yeah. Lucky me.

391
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:27,429
It's no trouble, is it?

392
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,417
Not the slightest.

393
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,522
Great. Whew.

394
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:33,711
Hey, man, I really appreciate it.

395
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:35,160
It's rough out there.

396
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:38,143
Billy, show our visitor where
the phone is in the kitchen.

397
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,875
And get me something to drink.

398
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:41,882
Yeah. Sure thing.

399
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:50,581
Hey, miss Gibbons,
this guy wants to use your phone.

400
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,874
Oh, sure, honey. It's right there.

401
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,243
Thanks.

402
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:02,831
Aah!

403
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:06,608
What's happening?

404
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:08,238
I'm really sorry.
But you're gonna need to invite

405
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:09,377
A friend of mine inside.

406
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:12,488
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's not allowed in the house.

407
00:20:12,488 --> 00:20:14,019
I know that. But you
gotta make an exception.

408
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,105
Get her out of the house. Now!

409
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:17,272
Miss Gibbons, tell me the truth.

410
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:18,904
Are you married? 
No.

411
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:21,550
Parents, children, anyone else
who lives on this property?

412
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:22,757
No. It's just me.

413
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:23,601
Good.

414
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,069
You were supposed to compel her.

415
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,617
It doesn't work that way...
She is human.

416
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:31,433
And I'm not! So, I don't care.

417
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:34,434
Now, get out of here.
And get rid of the body!

418
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,938
I'm in the process of
obtaining some property.

419
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:08,227
I understand that your

420
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:10,154
family is the largest
property owner in town.

421
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:12,212
Well, yes we are.

422
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:14,602
Dating all the way back to
the town's original charter.

423
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,739
Your family came into a lot
of new property in 1864.

424
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:20,270
You know your history.

425
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,782
It's a passion of mine.

426
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:26,219
Guy's not even subtle about it.

427
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:27,361
Who is that?

428
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:29,470
It's not my mother.

429
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:10,362
I'm sorry, Mayor.

430
00:22:11,224 --> 00:22:12,320
Do you know that boy over there?

431
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:14,580
Yeah it's Jeremy Gilbert.

432
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:18,053
You don't say.

433
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:25,808
Billy, what's the holdup?!

434
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:39,879
Aah!

435
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:52,911
Damn it, Elena!

436
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:08,176
Billy, Jacob, get back in here!

437
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,660
Are you insane?

438
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:51,139
Aah!

439
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:09,590
Aah!

440
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,053
Jeremy Gilbert?

441
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,385
Is that what you've been up to?

442
00:25:26,795 --> 00:25:28,628
He's my friend.
What's the big deal?

443
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:30,888
His family is the reason

444
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:32,792
I was stuck in a tomb
for over a century.

445
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,766
That doesn't mean he'll
make the same choices.

446
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:37,288
I want you to stop seeing him.

447
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,957
I've been on my own for
a long time, mother.

448
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:40,994
I can make my own decisions.

449
00:25:40,994 --> 00:25:43,234
Then stop acting like a child!

450
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:45,152
As soon as Jeremy finds out

451
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:47,253
what you really are,
he will turn on...

452
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:48,410
He already knows.

453
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:50,456
What did you just say?

454
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:52,071
Jeremy knows.

455
00:25:52,336 --> 00:25:54,668
He likes it. And he likes me.

456
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:17,340
Uhh.

457
00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:21,170
Thank you.

458
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:23,639
For trying to help me.

459
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:26,621
They just needed somebody to blame.

460
00:26:27,873 --> 00:26:29,374
Someone to punish.

461
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:33,037
Elena...

462
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:35,498
You shouldn't be here...

463
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:37,292
She was supposed
to stay in the car.

464
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:40,807
Unh! No. No. No. Not him.

465
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:43,300
Whatever. Let's get you down.

466
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:45,911
There's vervain on the ropes.

467
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:47,729
Elena, pull that.

468
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:51,944
Unh!

469
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,032
All right, let's go. Clothes on.

470
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,868
Wait. What? Guys, come on.

471
00:26:55,868 --> 00:26:57,143
We have to get out of here.

472
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:01,106
Uhh! Come on, we gotta go.

473
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:01,684
The other one.

474
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:03,917
Uhh!

475
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:09,185
Can you get him in the car?

476
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:11,233
Yeah. 
All right, go.

477
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:11,980
What about you?

478
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:13,954
You rescue, I'll distract. Go.

479
00:27:19,644 --> 00:27:20,444
Turn that down.

480
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:29,655
It's too quiet.

481
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:36,521
Spread out. Now.

482
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:42,210
You two, back of the house. Go.

483
00:27:42,985 --> 00:27:45,132
Check out both rooms. Cellar, now.

484
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:54,284
Uhh. Can you make it?

485
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:57,846
Uhh! Unh.

486
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,096
Ohh. You ok?

487
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:04,505
Yeah.

488
00:28:05,064 --> 00:28:06,885
Come on, we gotta
keep going. Come on.

489
00:28:07,156 --> 00:28:07,945
Ugh.

490
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:17,004
Aah! Ugh!

491
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:19,440
Aah! Aah!

492
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,377
I'm going after Frederick!

493
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,391
Come on, it's right over here.

494
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,385
Stefan...

495
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,469
Aah!

496
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,637
Ugh!

497
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:31,745
Uhh...

498
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,859
This is for Bethanne.

499
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:43,424
Aah!

500
00:29:43,826 --> 00:29:45,447
And this is for the tomb.

501
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:46,334
No!!!

502
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,429

00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:11,415
You do?

58
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:15,152
Oh. Well, then you should just carry on

59
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,055
making the rest of us vampires look bad.

60
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,592
Have a great day, Stef.

00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:32,036
[Returning footsteps]

62
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:35,039
Oh. Hey, I almost forgot something.

63
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:36,407
Oops.

64
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,912
Mmm. Mmm.

00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:50,721
Elena: Come on, Jeremy. Going to school.

67
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,289
Walking out the door now.

68
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:53,323
You forgot this.

69
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,859
Thank you.

70
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:57,728
Elena.

71
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:59,563
Uncle John. Hi.

72
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,465
Jenna.

73
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:02,666
John. You made it.

74
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,101
Said I'd be in by noon.

75
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,569
Oh, what you say and what you do

76
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,171
are typically very different things.

77
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:08,806
Uncle John. What's up?

78
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,340
Hey.

79
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:13,076
I had some business in town.

80
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:15,012
I thought a visit was in order.

81
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:16,914
- How long you staying?
- I don't know yet.

82
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,650
Hmm. Ok. Well, I'm gonna go
to school. I'll see you later.

83
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:26,123
What's up with Jeremy?

84
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,058
He just lost a friend,

85
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,660
so try to be sensitive.

86
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,929
[Chuckles] I'm always sensitive.

87
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:35,132
Right. So really, how lo are you staying?

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,534
Can't you at least pretend
that you're happy to see me?

89
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:38,569
Oh, my God, John.

90
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,304
It is so good to see you.

91
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:41,538
How have you been?

92
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,607
No, I can't.

93
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:45,409
Did you really think I was just gonna sign

94
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,944
the escrow papers and send 'em back?

95
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,078
Actually, I did.

96
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,113
I'm not gonna let you
sell my brother's office.

97
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:51,748
It's not up you or me.

98
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,150
It belongs to Jeremy and Elena.

99
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:55,719
But they're minors,
so I get the final say,

100
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:57,888
being that I'm the estate's trustee.

101
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:01,058
He said his trip is open-ended.

102
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,126
Uncle John. I never really liked that guy.

103
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:04,995
Heh. Does anyone?

104
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,197
I am here for moral
support if you need me.

105
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,867
Thanks. I think I'll
suffer this one alone.

106
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,501
You've been through enough.

107
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,071
Thank you, by e way,

108
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:15,973
for just... for everything you did

109
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,141
at Vicki's funeral and her memorial.

110
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,376
I couldn't have done it without you.

111
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,511
Of course, Matt.

112
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:27,384
So is Caroline still baking
for you guys around the clock?

113
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:29,486
She finally went to her dad's,

114
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:33,390
which is a good thing, because
my mom was gonna strangle her

115
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,559
if she dropped off more lasagna.

116
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:36,593
Oh.

117
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,096
[Music playing]

118
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,970
Nah.

119
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,472
What's your problem?

120
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,707
I just don't want any.

121
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:53,143
All right.

122
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:57,814
They say she oded.

123
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:01,118
That's what I don't get. She was doin' ok.

124
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:03,453
Apparently not.

125
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,657
How'd she end up buried in the woods?

126
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:07,858
That's what I don't understand.

127
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:10,060
By whoever was with her when she oded.

128
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:11,028
Yeah, but you leave her there.

129
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:12,462
You don't take the time to bury her.

130
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,898
Maybe she saw something and...

131
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,270
Hell, man, I don't know.

132
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,015
The coroner's office has officially ruled

133
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,718
Vicki Donovan's death drug overdose.

134
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:36,753
Her family has been notified.

135
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,288
The truth will stay in this room,

136
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:41,324
and we can put this behind us.

137
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:43,260
Thank you, sheriff.

138
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,430
And on to a more pressing issue.

139
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,532
John Gilbert has ask to say a few words.

140
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,967
Welcome back, John. It's good to see you.

141
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,135
- Thank you, mayor.
- Yeah.

142
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:54,171
Hello, everyone. It's
wonderful to see you.

143
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:56,106
I wish it were under better circumstances

144
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:57,474
as a founding family member,

145
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:00,077
I find it's my duty to report
some very distressing news.

146
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,078
He's a Gilbert?

147
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:02,145
Elena's uncle.

148
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:04,948
His name's John, but I call him jackass.

149
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:07,150
A hospital blood bank in the
neighboring county of Amherst

150
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:09,119
has reported several break-ins
over the past 2 weeks.

151
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:11,888
7 hunters, 4 campers,
and 2 state employees

152
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,890
have been reported missing as well,

153
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,626
all of this within a 75-mile
radius of mystic falls.

154
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:20,430
O... ok. No need to get
alarmed right at this Mont.

155
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:22,732
Meaning he doesn't wanna cancel
the founder's day kick-off party.

156
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,669
You think all of your problems are over,

157
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:29,906
but I'm here to tell you
nothing's been solved.

158
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:34,010
I made a copy of a paper
that Jeremy wrote for me.

159
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,247
I think you should take a look it.

160
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:42,986
Jeremy wrote this?

161
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:46,423
He's very clear that he
didn't think it was real.

162
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,058
I really hope you're right,

163
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:51,962
because I've done so much
to protect him from all this.

164
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,501
So how do you deal with it?

165
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,336
What do you mean?

166
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,838
I don't know. With all
the lies and the secrets.

167
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:05,775
You have to lie to everyone
who's important to you.

168
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,712
It's not safe for them to know the truth,

169
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,881
so, yes, I keep it from them,

170
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:13,383
but it's only because I love them.

171
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:18,822
I think Stefan's a good guy,

172
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,191
but, uh...

173
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,461
At the end of the day,
he's still a vampire.

174
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,496
I know it's hard to understand,

175
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:28,298
but Stefan's different.

176
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,936
He would never do anything to hurt me.

177
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:36,006
I have no interest in the
founder's day kick-off party.

178
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:37,641
Sure, you do. It's tradition.

179
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,776
Far be it for us to break from tradition.

180
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:43,280
The Gilberts have been a part
of this town for 150 years,

181
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:45,448
one of the founding families,

182
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:48,952
and with that distinction
comes certain obligations,

183
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,021
including going to the party.

184
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:54,457
One DA when you can
appreciate the significance,

185
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:57,027
I'll tell you all about your heritage.

186
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:59,629
Hmm. The Gilbert family legacy.

187
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:01,164
I forgot how sacred it was.

188
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm not a Gilbert, so I was
never cool enough to hear it.

189
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:07,070
Why does she hate you?

190
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,572
We used to sleep together.

191
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,275
I'm standing right here.

192
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,246
Why would he write a report on vampires?

193
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:18,682
Do you think he's starting to remember?

194
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,450
Damon took away those memories for good.

195
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:22,586
You don't have to worry about that.

196
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:26,189
Tell you what. Why don't you just ask him?

197
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,225
I... I can't.

198
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,794
Why not? I mean, if he
doesn't know anything,

199
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:34,164
then it's just a-an innocent question.

200
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:37,300
I don't even know how
to talk to him anymore.

201
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:41,838
I mean, we used to be a lot
more open with each other,

202
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:45,308
but now, with all these
secrets just piling up...

203
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,045
You know, I haven't even
told him that I'm adopted yet.

204
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:53,416
Maybe it's time you start
opening up to him again.

205
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,586
I'm not saying you should
tell him everything,

206
00:08:56,654 --> 00:09:00,924
but at least try to find out what
he does know and be prepared for it.

207
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,160
What about you? How are you doing?

208
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:06,363
I'm much, much better.

209
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,599
Yeah, I'm... I'm still,
you know, a little, uh...

210
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:13,270
a little jittery, a little
bit on edge, but, uh...

211
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,904
I'm... I'm gonna be ok.

212
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:19,309
I've been really worried
about you, and I missed you.

213
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:22,612
I just needed to lay
low for a little while,

214
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,481
and, uh, let my body readjust.

215
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:26,750
It's only been a few days.

216
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,652
It feels like a lifetime.

217
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,658
I've missed you, too.

218
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:13,296
Stefan, what's wrong?

219
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,200
Stefan.

220
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,198
Oh, good. You're here.

221
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,466
You ask, I come.

222
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:39,101
I'm easy like that.

223
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,506
[Dramatic] No, Elena, I will not...

224
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:46,074
Go to your bedroom with you.

225
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:50,913
Ah...

226
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,347
Just like I remembered.

227
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,016
Stop messing around.

228
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:03,525
You know, did you know that your uncle's
been kickin' it with the founder's council?

229
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:05,226
- What?
- Yep.

230
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,395
Perfect. We'll just add
it to the growing list

231
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:09,831
of how everything's falling apart.

232
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,699
What happened right there?

233
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:15,403
Uh, nothing.

234
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:20,308
Look, Damon, I... I'm
worried about Stefan.

235
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:21,910
He says that everything's ok,

236
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,278
but he's clearly struggling.

237
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:25,380
How long iit gonna take
before he's back to normal?

238
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:26,748
Few days, give or take.

239
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:27,982
It's been a few days.

240
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,717
Give then. I don't know.

241
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:30,885
What's the big deal?

242
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:33,154
He's not himself, Damon.

243
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:38,226
Well, maybe his problem is is he's
spent too long not being himself.

244
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,195
[Sighs]

245
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:44,432
Please don't make me sorry for asking you.

246
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,633
It is what it is, Elena.

247
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:46,634
Hey.

248
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:50,805
The Stefan you know was "good
behavior" Stefan, "reign it in" Stefan,

249
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:54,642
"fight against his nature to an
annoyingly obsessive level" Stefan,

250
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,779
but if you think there's
not another part to this,

251
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,181
then you have not been paying
attention. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

252
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:01,916
He's not you, not even close.

253
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:03,952
Well, he doesn't wanna be me.

254
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:08,623
But that doesn't mean
deep down that he's t.

255
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,926
Mm-hmm.

256
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,298
[Knocks on door]

257
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:51,432
Hey.

258
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,901
What's up?

259
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,836
Do you have some time to talk?

260
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:58,540
Uh, yeah, sure.

261
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,641
Not here.

262
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,110
Come on. Let's get out of the house.

263
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:09,150
I just can't believe mom and dad
never told you that you were adopted.

264
00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:10,919
I'm sure they would have eventually.

265
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:13,521
Why were y worried about what I thought?

266
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,758
Because... I don't know. It's weird...

267
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:21,362
Going your whole life thinking
you're related blood to someone.

268
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,666
Does it bug you that we're not?

269
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:25,800
No. Jer...

270
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,902
You're my brother.
That's all that matters.

271
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:34,442
So Mr. Saltzman said you've
been doing great in history now.

272
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,978
Yeah. Yeah, he's really
been helpin' me out.

273
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:39,380
He gave me some extra credit and stuff.

274
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:42,016
He loved your vampire paper.

275
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:44,285
Yeah, he thought I had a clever angle.

276
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:46,888
What drew you to that subject matter?

277
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,691
Uh, I don't know. Um, boredom.

278
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:53,928
Or maybe I'm just as nuts as
the long line of Gilbert crazies.

279
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:55,496
The Gilberts aren't crazy.

280
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:58,299
Ah, easy for you to say. You're not one.

281
00:13:58,367 --> 00:13:59,867
Ouch.

282
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,569
[Both laugh]

283
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:04,372
[Music playing]

284
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,717
Oh, God.

285
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,051
I shouldn't be here.

286
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,586
Come on. Don't be a downer.

287
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:20,588
It's a party for the founding families.

288
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:23,424
That would be us. It
would be rude to skip it.

289
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:27,095
You know, I... I really liked you a
whole lot better when you hated everybody.

290
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:28,429
Oh, I still do.

291
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:32,000
I just love that they love me. [chuckles]

292
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,036
How you feelin'?

293
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:36,304
I'm good. I'm fine.

294
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,172
No cravings? No urges?

295
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,009
Has that whiskey you been
drinkin' all day doin' its job?

296
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:42,010
Ah heh.

297
00:14:42,077 --> 00:14:44,679
We are who we are, Stan.

298
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:46,047
Pretending doesn't change that.

299
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:47,849
Ah, nothing would make you happier

300
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,451
than to just see me give in, huh, Damon?

301
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,552
Whatever. It's inevitable.

302
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,487
Hmm.

303
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:54,455
M gonna go find Elena.

304
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:56,791
Don't embarrass me, young man.

305
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:07,535
Ahh.

306
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:10,805
I'm so glad you could join us tonight.

307
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,707
It was nice of you to reach out to us.

308
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:15,109
This town is e big family,

309
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:17,111
and when we lose a member,

310
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,613
we all have to come together.

311
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,983
Matt. Kel.

312
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,556
Well, I guess dead kid

313
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:30,892
rates a special greeting
from the mayor, huh?

314
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,894
Go mom.

315
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:34,462
I need a drink.

316
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:36,898
[Sighs]

317
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:38,833
Hey, check it out.

318
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:42,236
Dude, your dad's gonna beat
you down if he catches you.

319
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:43,571
Yeah, let him try.

320
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,173
All right, screw it.

321
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:54,916
Hey.

322
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,652
Hey. How are you?

323
00:15:58,921 --> 00:15:59,787
Are you drunk?

324
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:02,090
[Clears throat] Um...

325
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,660
Ok, I know it's a little weird,

326
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:07,562
but it's really helping me.

327
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,163
The alcohol, it, uh...

328
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:10,765
Takes the edge off.

329
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,533
You're totally that drunk high school guy

330
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:13,768
at the party sneaking booze.

331
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,503
I totally am. Yeah.

332
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:16,571
How worried do I need to be?

333
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:19,207
Oh, no. You don't need to be worried.

334
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:22,577
It's just until, um, the cravings go away.

335
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:26,381
Listen. How about we
enjoy it while it lasts?

336
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:31,519
Would you like to dance
with me you hate dancing.

337
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:32,787
I usually have to beg you.

338
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:35,356
No, no, no. You have to beg the sober me.

339
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,392
The drunk me, there's
no begging necessary.

340
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,794
There's really no one dancing.

341
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:42,630
That's because they need
something better to dance to.

342
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:44,832
Be right back.

343
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,370
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

344
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:52,106
I already tried to bribe the
guy with 20 bucks and a date.

345

He said Carol Lockwood has complete
control over the music choices.

346
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:00,381
You'd be surprised what
Stefan can accomplish

347
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:02,150
when he puts his mind to it.

348
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:03,151

Thank God.

00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:17,932
Have I entered an alternate
universe where Stefan is fun?

352
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,035
Is he gonna be ok?

353
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,303
Eventually.

354
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:25,239

I haven't seen you in a while.

360
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,785
Yeah. Well, uh,

361
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,553
things have been a little crazy. Heh.

362
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:53,921
But I'm here now.

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,924
Sure.

00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,659
Ok. Great.

366
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:01,929

Heh.

00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:32,593
You know, I had my
doubts about you at first.

like what I have to tell you.

any more information on what
happened to Vicki Donovan.

392
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,294
It was an overdose, Jeremy.

393
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:08,329
Yeah, but her body was buried.

394
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,630
Somebody must have done that.

395
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,999
We're aware of that.

The investigation is ongoing,

397
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:16,671
but there's nothing more I
can tell you at this time.

You see, seems there was
a tomb under the church

along and set them free.

knew that, didn't you?

No one is trying figure
out what happened to her.

believe that she oded.

The coroner's office confirmed it.

I think somebody killed
her and buried her body,

it off just 'cause it's easy.

they can to move on.

00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,839
to do the honors of ringing
our official charter bell.

591
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:02,108
John Gilbert, would you
please join me up here?

592
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,845
[Applause]

593
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:11,551
150 years of community,
prosperity, family.

594
00:30:11,618 --> 00:30:13,419
We take care of each other,

595
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:17,623
look after each other, protect each other.

596
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,960
It's good to be home.

597
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,329
[Applause]

598
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:30,636
Look at his right hand. Whose?

599
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,673
The town's favorite son. Look at his ring.

600
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,610
[Tolling] [cheering]

601
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:39,679
Oh. That looks like mine.

602
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,347
Yeah, and that would be a big coincidence

603
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:43,816
if he didn't just come back
from the dead 5 minutes ago.

604
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,452
When the hell did you get that ring?

605
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,753
Isobel, my wife.

606
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:49,455
[Chuckles]

607
00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:55,895
Who gave birth Elena under the medical
care of the esteemed Dr. Grayson Gilbert,

608
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:57,930
John's brother.

609
00:30:57,998 --> 00:31:00,933
Oh. You think John knew Isobel?

610
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,836
I think John knows a lot of things.

611
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,717
Sorry about that, man.

612
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:20,553
No, really, I'm terribly sorry.

613
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:23,155
You don't wanna do this, man.

614
00:31:23,223 --> 00:31:24,890
[Sniffs]

615
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:27,460
Sorry about that, too.

616
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:30,529
God, all I can do is apologize.

617
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,964
What's that about?

618
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:34,634
Get out of my way, please.

619
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,572
No girl to show off for now?

620
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:44,010
I see how this is. Heh.

621
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:47,980
[Bones crack] [gasping]

622
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:02,495
Wh... what are you, man?

623
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:16,235
Elena: Stefan.

624
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:22,174
Stefan.

625
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:30,249
Hey. Hey, are you ok?

626
00:33:30,317 --> 00:33:32,218
[Groans]

627
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:33,319
What happened?

628
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,554
[Groaning]

629
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,159
My arm.

630
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,496
I lost my balance and fell.

631
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,131
I'm clumsy.

632
00:33:58,755 --> 00:33:59,688
Let's go.

633
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:00,724
Dad, I'm sorry.

634
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,726
I don't even know what happened.

635
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:04,795
I was drinking, and...

636
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:06,663
I lost control.

637
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:09,466
Can't explain it.

638
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:18,674
That is the last time you
ever embarrass this family.

639
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:34,623
What are you doing?

640
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:35,458
Matt, don't.

641
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:38,727
I can't do it anymore,
mom, so just go, all right?

642
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:40,896
You've done it before and
more times than I can count.

643
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:43,332
I'm not leaving you.

644
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,733
Matty.

645
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:46,268
Mom!

646
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,703
Don't you get it?

647
00:34:47,771 --> 00:34:50,372
I'm better off without you.

648
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:55,344
No.

649
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,948
Tonight was a...

650
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,616
God, I'm so sorry.

651
00:35:02,552 --> 00:35:06,255
I know I failed you, and I failed Vicki,

652
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:09,558
but I won't do it to you again.

653
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:11,861
I promise I'll get it together.

654
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,434
I want you out of the house...

655
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:22,304
And my life by morning.

656
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:25,341
Matty.

657
00:35:29,746 --> 00:35:32,014
Goin' somewhere? Hmm?

658
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:34,917
Never like to be the
last one to leave a party.

659
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:35,985
It's too desperate.

660
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,720
You here to kill me again?

661
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:40,089
Or you gonna let Mr.
Saltzman do your dirty work?

662
00:35:40,156 --> 00:35:41,891
Ok, you obviously know who I am.

663
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,460
I do. Alaric Saltzman,

664
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:46,262
the high school history
teacher with a secret.

665
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:49,064
Sure know a lot for someone
who just got to town.

666
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:52,301
More than you can imagine, Damon.

667
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:56,138
My knowledge of this town
goes beyond anything that you

668
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:58,741
you or the council knows.

669
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:02,077
So if you were planning
on some clever high-speed,

670
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:03,479
snatch-ring, vamp kill move,

671
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:08,551
know that if I die everything
I know goes to the council,

672
00:36:08,618 --> 00:36:10,419
including the fascinating little tale

673
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:11,787
of the original Salvatore brothers

674
00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:15,224
and their present-day
return to mystic falls.

675
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:18,561
How'd you get that ring?

676
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:23,566
I inherited one, my brother
gray, the other. This was his.

677
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,200
And I wouldn't have given mine to Isobel

678
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,336
had I known she'd hand
it over to another guy.

679
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:28,971
So you did know her.

680
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,573
Who do you think sent her your way

681
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,974
when she wanted to become a vampire?

682
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:33,008
You sent her?

683
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:34,610
Guilty.

684
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:36,478
Why, did you think someone else sent her?

685
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:37,947
Maybe Katherine Pierce?

686
00:36:38,882 --> 00:36:40,816
How do you know about Katherine?

687
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:42,451
How do I know anything, Damon?

688
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,320
What do you want?

689
00:36:44,387 --> 00:36:45,821
So many questions.

690
00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:48,424
It was a pleasure meeting you, Rick.

691
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:50,726
I've heard so much about you.

692
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:06,141
Not so excited that we have another
month of these founder's day events.

693
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:08,043
[Sighs] Tell me about it.

694
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,614
You ok?

695
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,048
Fine.

696
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:15,050
Are you sure?

697
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:17,152
I'm fine, Elena.

698
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:35,170
[Gasps]

699
00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:37,706
Oh, my God. You scared me.

700
00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:39,008
Sorry.

701
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:40,009
[Clears throat]

702
00:37:40,076 --> 00:37:42,745
I'm sorry that I... I ran off earlier.

703
00:37:42,812 --> 00:37:44,046
What happened?

704
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:45,781
Is everything ok?

705
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,683
[Deep breath]

706
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:49,184
[Chuckles]

707
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:51,120
Uh...

708
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:52,755
No.

709
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:54,390
Talk to me.

710
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:05,734
Stefan, tell me.

711
00:38:06,803 --> 00:38:08,570
I tried...

712
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:10,939
So hard to keep it together tonight.

713
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:14,076
[Sighs] And it was
working. It was working,

714
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:17,613
uh, but... but then Matt's mom, she,h,

715
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:19,615
got hurt, and she was bleeding,

716
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:22,451
and I had her... her blood on my hands.

717
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,219
And then what happened?

718
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:26,488
And then that... that
guy in the parking lot,

719
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:28,123
I wanted to feed on him,

720
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:31,060
and it took everything
inside of me not to do it.

721
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:32,127
But you didn't?

722
00:38:32,195 --> 00:38:34,329
No, but I wanted to.

723
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,364
[Sighs] God.

724
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:38,100
Elena, I... my...

725
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:41,003
my head is pounding,

726
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:45,174
I feel like my... skin
is on... is on fire.

727
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:47,643
I have this hunger inside
of me that I've never...

728
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:49,712
I've never felt before in my entire life,

729
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,747
and all I keep thinking about

730
00:38:51,815 --> 00:38:54,316
is how I promised that I would
never keep anything from you,

731
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:55,651
and so I'm telling you this.

732
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,986
That's ok. I need you
to tell me these things.

733
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:00,189
But I don't want you to see me like this.

734
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,858
I don't want you to know
that this side of me exists.

735
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,426
Stefan, you're gonna get through this.

736
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:05,928
I'm gonna help you pull through.

737
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:08,163
It's gonna be ok. You're gonna be ok.

738
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:09,598
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

739
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:14,236
No, I'm sorry. I can't.

740
00:39:14,304 --> 00:39:19,041
I... I'm afraid of what I could do to you.

741
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:23,946
I'm not.

742
00:39:25,515 --> 00:39:26,381
Stefan.

743
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,650
Stefan, I'm not.

744
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:35,290
I'm not, ok?

745
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:48,704
I love you so much.

746
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:52,341
Oh, I love you, too.

747
00:39:55,378 --> 00:39:58,080
[Footsteps]

748
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:04,887
We have a problem, Stefan.

749
00:40:04,954 --> 00:40:08,657
And when I say, "problem,"
I mean global crisis.

750
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,595
Seems uncle John has a...

751
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:18,267
You don't look so good.

752
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:21,637
It's different this time, isn't it?

753
00:40:21,704 --> 00:40:23,839
The need is too strong.

754
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:28,944
Of course it would be
after all these years.

755
00:40:40,323 --> 00:40:42,124
Have a good night, brother.

00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:10,056
Nice car.

2
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:12,392
I thought it was a waste

3
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:13,760
To leave it sitting in the garage.

4
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:18,632
I didn't know you were
coming back today.

5
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,967
You know, I woke up this morning

6
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:22,636
And I was feeling great,

7
00:01:22,637 --> 00:01:26,306
And I figured it was time for
me to get back into things.

8
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:28,842
Does that mean you're ok now?

9
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,278
With all the cravings?

10
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:33,346
Yeah. I mean,
the worst part is over.

11
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:35,282
So... now all I want to do

12
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:39,352
Is just spend as much
time with you as possible.

13
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:41,921
I'm ok with that.

14
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,991
Hey, thank you.

15
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:47,627
For helping me get through the...

16
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:49,629
The rough patch.

17
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,931
You're welcome.

18
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,434
We're going to be late.

19
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:55,769
Ok, um, you know what,

20
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,305
I'll catch up with you.
I'm gonna grab my stuff.

21
00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,306
I'll be right behind you.

22
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:01,107
Ok.

23
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:27,000
There was a disturbance at the
hospital blood bank last night.

24
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,668
Some of the supply
was compromised.

25
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:31,671
Compromised? You mean stolen.

26
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:33,506
We almost missed it.

27
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,308
The inventory records
were altered,

28
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:36,976
But when the night
manager was questioned,

29
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:39,079
He had no recollection
of changing them.

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,647
Meaning the vampire
who stole the blood

31
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:42,482
Used mind control
to hide the theft.

32
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:43,703
I know what she meant.

33
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:45,752
We wouldn't have noticed
if John not alerted us

34
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:46,986
To recent discrepancies

35
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,788
At other hospital blood
banks in the county.

36
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:51,626
How lucky for us, we have John.

37
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:53,124
We're stepping up
security at the hospital,

38
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,351
Giving the guards vervain

39
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:56,229
To prevent this from
happening again.

40
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,064
Sheriff, might I
offer a suggestion?

41
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,723
Why don't Damon and I
put our heads together?

42
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:02,374
We can track down
whoever's doing this.

43
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,209
Truthfully, I could
use the extra hands.

44
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,581
Is that something you'd
be willing to do?

45
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:09,783
Well, of course, I mean,
if it'll help.

46
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:11,284
I think we'll make a good team.

47
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:13,553
Don't you, Damon?

48
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:15,855
John, whatever I can do to
help keep this town safe,

49
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:18,725
Even if it means
spending time with you.

50
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:25,865
Ok.

51
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,567
This week we're going
to set aside our

52
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:30,170
Regular curriculum for a
lesson in local history

53
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:31,838
As we approach founder's day.

54
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,007
Apparently the community leaders

55
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:35,275
Feel that's more important
than world war II,

56
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:37,010
But hey, what do I know?

57
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:39,312
Sorry I'm late.

58
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:40,680
Looks like we will be
at full occupancy today.

59
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:43,516
Welcome home, Bonnie.

60
00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:45,051
Right, founder's day.

61
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:47,153
What does it mean to
have a founder's day?

62
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:50,223
Well, if you'll turn
your attention to this

63
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:51,691
Exquisite diorama over here

64
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,159
That I spent all night...

65
00:03:56,964 --> 00:03:58,698
I suppose I should be grateful

66
00:03:58,699 --> 00:03:59,966
You learned how to use the bell.

67
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,869
I'm here on behalf of my mother.

68
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,071
On behalf of or in spite of?

69
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:07,607
I'm sorry about what the
other vampires did to Stefan.

70
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,279
Abducting him, torturing him.

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,614
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

72
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:13,083
You were playing house
with half of a tomb

73
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:14,518
Of really pissed off vampires.

74
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,286
What did you think
was going to happen?

75
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:19,389
My mom is devastated.
They tried to overthrow her.

76
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,491
Why isn't she here
telling me this?

77
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:23,160
She doesn't really do apologies.

78
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,127
Well, that's a coincidence,

79
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:25,228
'cause I don't do forgiveness,

80
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,229
So just run along.

81
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,430
And if you're going to continue

82
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:29,132
Playing house with your
little vampire pets,

83
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:31,434
You might want to stop
robbing the blood bank dry,

84
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:33,570
Because they're onto it.

85
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:36,873
I haven't been to the local
blood bank in at least a week.

86
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:38,241
Then it's one of your others.

87
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:39,543
The other ones are gone, Damon.

88
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:41,444
Well, where'd they go?

89
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:42,879
They weren't cut
out for this town.

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,080
After what happened
with your brother,

91
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,282
My mom kicked them out
and they took off.

92
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,951
It's just us and Harper now.

93
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,922
Bonnie.

94
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:54,124
Hey.

95
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,427
Hey, I, um, I tried to
grab you after class

96
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,329
But you'd already taken off.

97
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,698
How are you? How's your family?

98
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,234
We're dealing. It's been hard.

99
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,473
Everyone here really missed you.

100
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,578
Yeah, I just had so
much to deal with

101
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,685
After grams' funeral,

102
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:12,605
And honestly after you told me
that the tomb's spell failed,

103
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,377
I just didn't really
want to come back.

104
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:16,479
I hope you understand
why I called.

105
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,882
I wanted you to know
before you came home.

106
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,718
Yeah, I understand why.
I just wish I didn't know.

107
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:25,188
I know it's been really hard...

108
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:26,289
Bonnie!

109
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,259
Bonnie! Thank God you're home!

110
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,428
I know we talked every day,
but I missed you!

111
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:32,796
How are you doing?

112
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:34,631
Better. Just better. You know,

113
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:36,032
Glad to be back,

114
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,801
And try to keep myself busy.

115
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:39,035
Well, I can help with that.

116
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:42,138
Major wardrobe confab needed asap.

117
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,340
You need to help me
pick the perfect dress

118
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:46,109
For the founder's court. Oh.

119
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,345
The founder's court?
Did I miss something?

120
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,981
The founder's court.

121
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:53,984
You know, miss Mystic Falls.

122
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,186
They announced it today, and, um,

123
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:57,887
You and are both on it.

124
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:59,122
Oh, my God, we signed
up for that so long ago.

125
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:00,924
I completely forgot.

126
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,158
Yeah.

127
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,994
So are you dropping out, then?

128
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:09,266
I can't.

129
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,834
No?

130
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,703
Her mom is the one who
wanted her to enter.

131
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:22,746
How was school?

132
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,482
Fine.

133
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:27,317
Yeah? Same old, same old?

134
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:29,386
Nothing new?

135
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:31,187
No stories to bring home?

136
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,591
You're making small talk, why?

137
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,526
You seem awfully chipper lately.

138
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:39,429
Less doom and gloom,
a little more pep in your step.

139
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,765
And you think it's because
I drank human blood again.

140
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,967
I mean, I don't want to brag,

141
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:46,303
But I would definitely
take responsibility

142
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,238
For this new and improved you.

143
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,240
Right, right. Well,
I hate to burst your bubble,

144
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,541
But I'm clean.

145
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,743
Yeah, not possible.

146
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:56,880
Not only is it possible,
but it is quite true.

147
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:59,949
Stefan, let's be
serious for a second.

148
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,619
You spent the last
century and a half

149
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,488
Being a poster child for Prozac,

150
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:08,091
And now you expect me to
believe that this new you

151
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:11,294
Has nothing to do with
human blood, nothing.

152
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:15,098
I'm clean.

153
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:16,966
You're lying!

154
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,903
Believe what you want.

155
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,776
I'm sorry for the short notice.

156
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:28,812
I didn't even know that
the contest was coming up,

157
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:30,313
Much less that I would be in it.

158
00:07:30,314 --> 00:07:32,449
Well, I'll be happy to
escort you anywhere.

159
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,218
My mom was really into
this founder's day stuff.

160
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,253
She was even miss
Mystic in her day.

161
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:39,622
I kinda wanted to do it for her.

162
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:41,391
Well, it'll be great.

163
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:42,959
We'll have fun.

164
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,495
Ok. I'll see tomorrow. I love you.

165
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:46,830
I love you, too.

166
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,492
Well, well.

167
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:17,560
He's a liar and a thief.

168
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:28,197
So...

169
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:30,466
When were you going to share?

170
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,802
Go ahead.

171
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,080
Help yourself.
No, no, I'm talking about

172
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,606
The fact that you're
a closet blood junkie.

173
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,474
So I'm drinking blood again.

174
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,076
You're the one that
shoved it on me.

175
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:42,278
What's your problem?

176
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,981
I have it under control.
Under control?

177
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,283
You robbed the hospital.

178
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:48,951
So what's your point?

179
00:08:48,952 --> 00:08:51,721
Fine. Whatever, man. Drink up.

180
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:54,323
Just remember we're trying
to keep a low profile.

181
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:55,625
Why don't you just walk up

182
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,260
To sheriff Forbes,
ask her to tap a vein.

183
00:08:57,261 --> 00:09:00,396
Have my actions
negatively impacted you?

184
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:03,299
Ooh. I can't imagine
what that must feel like.

185
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,636
Yeah, what's Elena think
about the new... you?

186
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:09,372
Nothing's changed.
I'm still the same person.

187
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:10,706
Clearly.

188
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,909
Elena doesn't need
to know anything yet.

189
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:17,413
You've been off the human
stuff for years, Stefan.

190
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:18,581
If you're having
trouble controlling--

191
00:09:18,582 --> 00:09:19,682
I'm not having any trouble.

192
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:21,217
Who do you think
you're talking to?

193
00:09:21,218 --> 00:09:22,852
I know what it's like.

194
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,387
That Jekyll and Hyde feeling.

195
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:26,422
There's that switch,
sometimes it goes off and you snap.

196
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:28,069
Right now is not a
good time for me

197
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,959
To be worried about you snapping.

198
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,195
I know that it pains
you to see this.

199
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:34,196
Hmm.

200
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:37,033
But I'm fine, ok?

201
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,768
I'm fine.

202
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,102
So please,

203
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,971
Do me a favor.

204
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,075
And back off.

205
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,515
This year's queen will have

206
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:54,335
The special honor of
taking center stage

207
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:56,719
AT THE 150th FOUNDER'S DAY GALA.

208
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,254
Before we crown our winner,

209
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:59,455
We'd like to get to know

210
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,057
A bit more about each of you.

211
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,959
I'm on the m.F.
Beautification committee.

212
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,994
I volunteer at the rec
center soup kitchen.

213
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,929
I recognize that I haven't
been as involved this year

214
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,194
As I used to be.

215
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:11,028
I implemented this year's
go green campaign at school.

216
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,624
I've been distracted,
and I let a lot of things slide.

217
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,893
I don't think it's wrong for
me to win 2 years in a row.

218
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:17,561
I was surprised to
have been selected.

219
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:19,897
Since I'm not from one
of the founding families.

220
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:21,165
But I'm aware of what
an honor this is,

221
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,500
And I want you to know
that I take it seriously.

222
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,302
Worked with the county's
recycling program

223
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:27,671
And was in charge of the
policemen's yearly raffle.

224
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:30,243
Just because my DUI made my
community service mandatory,

225
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:31,660
Doesn't mean I was
any less committed.

226
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:34,593
This was really
important to my mother.

227
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:36,547
She believed in community,

228
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,016
Family, honor and loyalty.

229
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:42,519
It's the legacy she left for me.

230
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,143
Hey, partner.

231
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:48,054
What do you want?

232
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:50,327
You haven't returned
any of my calls.

233
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:52,529
Most people take that as a hint.

234
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,299
Why don't we start
looking for vampires?

235
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,667
Why the act, John?

236
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:59,216
I mean, you obviously don't
care about catching vampires.

237
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:00,304
You're here talking to me.

238
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,905
Actually, I care very much.

239
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:02,940
What did Isobel say about that?

240
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:05,242
I mean, considering
that she is one.

241
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:09,246
Isobel and I share
a mutual interest.

242
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:11,315
The original Johnathan
Gilbert had an invention

243
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:13,417
That was stolen by a vampire.

244
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:15,219
That vampire was then burned alive

245
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,654
In fell's church,
or so Johnathan thought.

246
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,330
And the invention
was lost forever.

247
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:20,597
Hmm.

248
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,700
But then the vampires
weren't killed, were they?

249
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:26,269
They were trapped.

250
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,670
And now they're free,
thanks to you,

251
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,472
Which means the invention
is retrievable.

252
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:31,374
Well, what is it?

253
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,376
The only thing that matters
is that I want it back,

254
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:36,279
And you're going to help me
if you want your secret safe.

255
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,681
I mean, why bring
me into it, John?

256
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:40,216
I mean, I don't even know
what you're talking about,

257
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:41,284
Much less who has it.

258
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,919
Oh, come on, Damon.

259
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,487
You were around back then.

260
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:47,991
You know who these people are,
what they look like.

261
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:49,592
He was friendly with a woman

262
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:50,994
Who turned out to be a vampire.

263
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,362
Her name was Pearl.

264
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:54,898
Does that ring a bell?

265
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,839
I'm not playing anymore.

266
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,007
Get out.

267
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:05,608
Get out.

268
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:07,043
I beg your pardon?

269
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:08,166
You know, I only entertain

270
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,084
This whole blackmail
scheme thing of yours

271
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:12,486
Because I thought that you and
Isobel could lead me to Katherine.

272
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:15,155
But see, now I know you have
no idea where Katherine is,

273
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:17,591
Because if you did, you would know

274
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:19,093
That Katherine and Pearl

275
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:20,995
Were best friends.

276
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:23,717
See, you don't know everything,

277
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:25,719
Do you, John?

278
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:30,047
I'll tell the entire
council what you are.

279
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,815
Go for it. I'll kill
every last one of them.

280
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:34,884
Then I'll sever your hand,
pull your ring off,

281
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,686
And I'll kill you, too.

282
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:38,921
Do you understand that?

283
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:43,259
Honor your partner.

284
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:50,233
Let's focus. Right hand around.

285
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,570
Flirt with your eyes.

286
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:01,444
Left hand around.

287
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,617
This is ridiculous.

288
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:09,986
Both hands.
You're only saying that

289
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:11,187
Because you don't
know how to do it.

290
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,289
Sorry only one of us was around

291
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,724
When the dance was invented.

292
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,225
Ouch! Oooh!

293
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:18,861
Oh, no, no, no, no.

294
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:20,396
There's no touching
during this part.

295
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:23,633
It's about the simple
intimacy of the near-touch.

296
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:24,700
Very nice, Amber.

297
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,235
Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood!

298
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:30,940
If you ask me,
the near touch is overrated.

299
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:33,543
You seem to be in a good mood.

300
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:34,911
Is that a bad thing?

301
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:37,213
Would you prefer me to
be brooding and tortured?

302
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:38,581
Hey, I'm not complaining.

303
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:40,817
Oh, no touching.

304
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:45,388
The Fell cousins
don't have a shot.

305
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:47,223
And Amber Bradley
is only on the court

306
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:49,959
So the pageant doesn't look like
it's founding families only.

307
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,260
Which, of course, it is.

308
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:52,862
So that leaves Elena.

309
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:55,465
She totally has the sympathy
vote since her parents died.

310
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,200
How can I compete with that?

311
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:59,135
Very nice.

312
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:00,169
Very sensitive.

313
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,504
Oh, I'm sorry. This must sound

314
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:03,840
Really unimportant in
light of everything.

315
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,575
It's ok. I get it.

316
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,276
You want to win.

317
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:09,612
Well, my grandmother
was miss Mystic.

318
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:11,080
And both of my aunts.

319
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:13,349
My mom's the only one
who didn't get the gene,

320
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,284
And I want this.

321
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,153
I mean, I actually deserve this.

322
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:25,595
Bonnie.

323
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:28,130
Hey. Hey.

324
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:30,500
How are you?

325
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,172
I begged Bonnie to
fill in for Matt.

326
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:38,274
He had to work today.

327
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:42,645
Bonnie, do you have a minute?

328
00:14:43,814 --> 00:14:46,549
We only have 30
minutes for rehearsal.

329
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,017
It'll only take a minute.

330
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,486
Please?

331
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:05,501
Bonnie, you have to
tell me what's wrong.

332
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:07,303
It's not worth talking about.

333
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:09,572
What do you mean, not worth it?

334
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:12,174
You've barely said 10 words to me,

335
00:15:12,175 --> 00:15:14,210
And you won't even look at Stefan.

336
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,014
Is that what it is, is it Stefan?

337
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:23,019
Listen.

338
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,488
Elena, I can't just pretend

339
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,156
Like everything is ok.

340
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:29,425
Everything my grams
did was to protect us

341
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:31,827
From those vampires in the tomb.

342
00:15:31,828 --> 00:15:35,898
And now they're out,
which means she died for nothing.

343
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:42,471
I'm so sorry, Bonnie.

344
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:44,840
What can I do to make it better?

345
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:46,208
That's just it.

346
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,044
There's nothing you can do.

347
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:51,581
I blame him, Elena.

348
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:52,815
Him and Damon.

349
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,483
And I'm not going to
put you in a situation

350
00:15:54,484 --> 00:15:56,953
Where you have to choose sides.

351
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:00,523
I'm just having a
hard time with it.

352
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,758
Ok?

353
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,844
Dude, are you ok? You're bleeding.

354
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:34,457
Ahh, Stefan!

355
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,058
Are you ok?

356
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:37,927
Yes. I'm sorry.

357
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:40,730
I was just...

358
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:43,032
I was feeling a little sick.

359
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,934
I'll be fine.

360
00:16:58,112 --> 00:16:59,279
Hey. Hi.

361
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,314
I heard you're driving.
Yeah, I am.

362
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:02,482
Let me get that for you.

363
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:03,884
Thanks.

364
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:05,018
Yeah.

365
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:06,586
Um, how, uh--

366
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,922
How is Stefan?

367
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:11,224
What do you mean?

368
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:13,427
You know, he seems on edge.

369
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:14,961
He went through a lot,

370
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:16,797
He was in bad shape for a while.

371
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:18,331
But he's bouncing back now.

372
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,067
Alaric.

373
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:24,337
Hey, buddy.
What are you doing here?

374
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,373
Well, I'm the chauffer.

375
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:27,808
Oh, I thought I was driving.

376
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,810
Oh, no need.

377
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:31,445
We're going with Rick.

378
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,148
Are we ready?

379
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:36,450
Jeremy can ride with you.

380
00:17:57,472 --> 00:18:00,140
In the running for
miss Mystic Falls?

381
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:03,677
Sometimes you have to wear
uncomfortable heels to blend in.

382
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,715
I remember this event from 1864.

383
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:11,218
I was supposed to enter,

384
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,986
Before everything happened.

385
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:15,922
Ahh, nostalgia's a bitch.

386
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:17,858
If you're just going to mock me,

387
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:20,093
Can you move along, please.

388
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:23,029
John Gilbert thinks your
mom stole an artifact

389
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,234
From Johnathan Sr.
Sr. Back in 1864.

390
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:29,319
What are you, his errand boy?

391
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,021
I don't know what it is,

392
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,655
But I don't want him to have it.

393
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:33,775
I could ask her.

394
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,335
But, you know,
you've made it pretty clear

395
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:36,670
That you don't trust us,

396
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,338
So why should I even bother?

397
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:39,940
Because you want to
stay in Mystic Falls,

398
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:41,875
And John Gilbert's in town,
making that impossible.

399
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:44,244
Find out where it is.

400
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:47,448
He leaves, you can
buy a welcome mat.

401
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:53,220
Thanks for helping me.

402
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:54,688
Don't thank me

403
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:56,824
Until you're sure your hair
isn't going to burn off.

404
00:18:58,426 --> 00:18:59,760
You know, I remember

405
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:02,262
When my mom and I were
first applying for this.

406
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:04,364
She was so excited.

407
00:19:04,365 --> 00:19:06,767
So were you, if I recall.

408
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:08,335
I was.

409
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:10,871
She just made it sound
like so much fun.

410
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:12,906
Lots has changed since then.

411
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,908
Well, I hate to break it to you,

412
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,643
But it's a little
late for cold feet.

413
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:19,580
I don't have cold feet. I just...

414
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:22,249
I think I'd be enjoying it
a lot more if she was here.

415
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:27,855
I'll tell you one thing,

416
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:30,457
Your hair would have a
better chance if she was.

417
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:35,896
Ok, I should go put my dress on.

418
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:37,931
Be careful with that thing.

419
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:39,700
Don't hurt anybody.

420
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,273
You look miserable.

421
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:49,176
Are there really a whole
month of these events

422
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:50,711
That I'm supposed to show up at?

423
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,579
You can fight it if you want,

424
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,715
But it's part of being a Gilbert.

425
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,985
Yeah, you, uh, you mentioned you
know a lot about the family.

426
00:19:57,986 --> 00:20:01,288
Do you know anything about our
ancestor Johnathan Gilbert?

427
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,470
Prolific writer, crazy inventor.

428
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,500
Why do you ask?

429
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,050
Well, I read his journal.

430
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,360
Is that right?

431
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,710
Yeah.

432
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,310
I actually found it
in all dad's stuff.

433
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,110
Well, that's surprising.

434
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,750
Most of them are locked away.

435
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,059
There's more of them?

436
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,940
Johnathan Gilbert
journaled his whole life.

437
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,230
Right down to the bitter,
insane drunken end.

438
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,080
Guy had a lot of demons.

439
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,370
And did you read 'em?

440
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,100
I browsed, yeah.

441
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,700
What'd you think
about what he wrote?

442
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,730
Crazy ramblings of a mad man,
of course.

443
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,460
Well, she's very pretty.

444
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,260
Yeah, yeah, she's a, uh,

445
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,430
A friend of mine. Excuse me.

446
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,990
Are you ok, Amber?

447
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,450
I hate being the
center of attention.

448
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,340
I get panic attacks.

449
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,500
Do you need some privacy
so you can change?

450
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,130
Actually, I'm just-
I'm just going to go get some air.

451
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,429
You can't be back here.

452
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,320
We need to talk.

453
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,280
Does it have to be right now?

454
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,050
Normally I would have a
completely different outlook

455
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,259
On what I'm about to tell you,

456
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,110
But since it could
really inconvenience me,

457
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,340
I'll squeal.

458
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,190
What are you talking about?

459
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,010
Stefan's still
drinking human blood.

460
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,140
What? Yeah.

461
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,290
A month ago,
I would have rejoiced.

462
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,460
But with the council
back on the alert,

463
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:51,379
It is not a good time for
Stefan to fly off the handle.

464
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,739
I know he's been a little edgy,

465
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,130
But he said that was normal.

466
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:57,349
He has a fridge full of
stolen blood bank contraband

467
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,380
In the house.

468
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,599
Oh, my God.

469
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,559
He has no idea what normal is.

470
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,570
His entire existence isn't normal.

471
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,720
Normal to a vampire is
drinking human blood.

472
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,690
But he spent all
this time fighting it

473
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,810
When he should have been
learning how to control it.

474
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,520
And now it's controlling
him instead.

475
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,399
I can't believe this.

476
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,410
I mean, it's Stefan that
we're talking about here.

477
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:21,049
Stefan on human blood, Elena.

478
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,510
He'll do anything,
he'll say anything,

479
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,550
Because he's not going
to want to stop.

480
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,630
Trust me.

481
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,610
Anna!

482
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,020
What is it?

483
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,240
Come on, don't be like that.

484
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,180
Why not?

485
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,839
You're basically using me
to turn you into a vampire

486
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,179
So you could be with someone else.

487
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,540
No, I wasn't using you.

488
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,100
Really?

489
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,620
Then how would you
like to define it?

490
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,849
Look, I don't think it's any worse

491
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,129
Than becoming friends with me

492
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,790
So you could give
your mother my blood.

493
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,670
How do you know that?

494
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,980
That's not important.

495
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,990
Seriously, Jeremy.

496
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,370
What do you know?

497
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,060
Everything. I know everything.

498
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,870
This is all my fault.

499
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:12,860
I'm the one who fed him the
blood in the first place.

500
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,400
What's going on in here?

501
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,429
Just filling Elena in

502
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,030
On your extracurricular
activities.

503
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,790
What are you talking about?

504
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,630
I know about the blood, Stefan.

505
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,699
I'm gonna-- I'll be downstairs,

506
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,410
Drinking.

507
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,810
I was going to tell you.

508
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,920
When?

509
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,690
I'm fine.

510
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,260
I'm fine. The blood,
it doesn't change anything.

511
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,969
It's changing you.

512
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,680
Why, because I kept
it a secret from you?

513
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,719
Come on, Elena.

514
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,699
Look, given the way that
you're reacting right now,

515
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,560
Can you really blame
me for doing that?

516
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,020
Are you hearing
yourself right now?

517
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,010
You've been stealing
blood and lying,

518
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,230
And you say that
everything's fine?

519
00:24:14,231 --> 00:24:15,890
Everything's not fine, Stefan.

520
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,509
So what, so you and Damon

521
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,250
All of a sudden have
everything figured out then?

522
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,580
It's not about Damon.

523
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,409
It's about what's
happening to you.

524
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,320
I know, and I'm telling
you that I'm fine.

525
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,730
I'm fine.

526
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,060
Please, come on.

527
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,410
Elena, I thought you...

528
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,800
I thought you believed in me.

529
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,250
Elena? Let's go.
The line up's starting.

530
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,609
I just--

531
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,370
I need a minute.

532
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,830
You're not even dressed yet.

533
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,690
Escorts wait downstairs, Stefan.

534
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,520
God!

535
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,440
Oh, God, sorry!

536
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,280
Ms. Tina Fell,

537
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,070
Escorted by Bartholomew Whitmore.

538
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,620
Has anyone seen Amber?

539
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,370
Do you see Stefan down there?

540
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:31,960
Nope.

541
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:34,100
Just my boring fill-in escort.

542
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,380
What happened to Matt?

543
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,080
They wouldn't let him out of work.

544
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,350
Hey, what happened to Stefan?

545
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,409
I don't know. He just
disappeared somewhere.

546
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,070
I don't know.

547
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,800
What am I doing?

548
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,130
I never should have
gone through with this.

549
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,970
What do you mean?
I need to find Stefan.

550
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,240
This isn't me.
I'm not this person anymore.

551
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,780
Uh, no, no, no, no way, no.

552
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,080
You had your chance to drop out.

553
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,930
And believe me, I was all for it.

554
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,510
Because there is no way
that I can beat you.

555
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,600
Elena, you're doing this because
it was important to your mom.

556
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,740
Ms. Caroline Forbes,

557
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,920
And her escort Jeffrey
Lockwood Hamilton.

558
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,610
Elena, you're next. Come on.

559
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,640
You're missing
Elena's introduction.

560
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,990
I don't care.

561
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,590
So she has no idea
you read her journal?

562
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,929
She keeps things from me,

563
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,260
I'm going to keep things from her.

564
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,510
What are you going to do now?

565
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,480
Now that you know everything
that she's been hiding from you?

566
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,320
I don't know.

567
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,569
There's a part of me
that's so angry, you know,

568
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,910
That she covered up
what happened to Vickie

569
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,670
And erased my memory,

570
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,240
But there's this other
part of me that's glad.

571
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,830
I--

572
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,620
I don't want to remember
Vickie like that.

573
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,130
As a monster?

574
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,890
No, as someone who
wanted to hurt me.

575
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,390
When I met you,

576
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,450
You were just a part of my
plan to get my mother back.

577
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,910
But then things changed.

578
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,180
All the time we spent together.

579
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,640
I would never do anything
to hurt you. Not now.

580
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,990
You know that, right?

581
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,180
Yeah, I know that.

582
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,589
Where are we going?

583
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,250
I don't know.

584
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,640
I'm in the ceremony.

585
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,690
Not now, you're not.

586
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,200
You're standing in the
parking lot with me.

587
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,360
I'm in the parking lot with you.

588
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,970
I'm sorry.

589
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,650
I'm sorry.

590
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,309
I'm not very good to
be around right now.

591
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,470
I'm a little bit on edge.

592
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,709
I've--I've been
drinking the human stuff

593
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,960
And it's really
screwing with my head.

594
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,280
Oh! she knows now.

595
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,689
God, she wasn't
supposed to find out.

596
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,800
I didn't want her to find out,
now everything's ruined.

597
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,430
You seem sad.

598
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,870
I'm not sad!

599
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,720
I'm freaking hungry!

600
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,470
Ms. Elena Gilbert,

601
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,130
Escorted by Mr. Stefan Salvatore.

602
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,130
Where's Stefan? I don't know.

603
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,270
What is she doing with Damon?

604
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,890
I have no idea.

605
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,689
What are we going to do?

606
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,350
Right now we just have
to get through this.

607
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,560
I don't hurt people.

608
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,269
I don't do that.

609
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,370
I'm the good brother.

610
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,220
Do you want to hurt me?

611
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,080
I want to kill you.

612
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,100
I want to rip into your skin,

613
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,680
And I want to feed on your blood.

614
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,170
Under your skin,

615
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,570
Pulsating, flowing.

616
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,680
Your carotid artery, right there.

617
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,859
If you puncture this just right,

618
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,290
You can control the blood flow.

619
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,670
It takes practice,

620
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:17,289
But it doesn't have
to make a mess.

621
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,550
You don't have to waste any.

622
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,650
What's stopping you?

623
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,430
If I do this,

624
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,360
If I give in,
there's no going back.

625
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,650
Then don't.

626
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,319
I just want one taste.

627
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,300
That's all I need.
Just one more taste

628
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,170
One taste?

629
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,930
Where's Amber?

630
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,230
I don't know.

631
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,660
Before I crown the winner,

632
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,970
I'd like to offer a
personal thank you

633
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:03,049
To all of these young
ladies for their efforts

634
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,520
To better our communities.

635
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,830
So, without further adieu,

636
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:15,819
It is my honor to announce our
very own miss Mystic Falls,

637
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,380
Ms. Caroline Forbes!

638
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,740
Congratulations!

639
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,030
I actually won!

640
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,950
There's blood on the glass

641
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,880
Get me Damon Salvatore.

642
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,060
I can't do this!

643
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,920
What's the matter?
I can't do this.

644
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,540
It's ok.

645
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,190
It doesn't hurt that much.

646
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,760
Just not so hard next time.

647
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,410
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

648
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,470
I can't stop.

649
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,040
I can't stop.

650
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,990
Why aren't you afraid of me, huh?

651
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,800
You told me not to be.

652
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,890
What?

653
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,450
What's your name?

654
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,630
Amber.

655
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,560
Listen to me, Amber.

656
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,550
I need you to be afraid of me.

657
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,179
I need you to run like hell,

658
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,210
Do you understand me?

659
00:33:28,211 --> 00:33:30,210
Run, run, now!

660
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,740
What is it, did you find him?

661
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,810
There were signs of struggle
in the upstairs bathroom.

662
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:43,960
There was blood.

663
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,960
And that Amber girl is missing.

664
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,310
Oh, my God.

665
00:33:47,311 --> 00:33:48,940
He wouldn't hurt her.

666
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,069
He won't.

667
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,460
Let's just find him, ok?

668
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,090
Let's get your coat, come on.

669
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,290
You said to run!

670
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,830
I changed my mind.

671
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,030
Stefan! oh!

672
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,240
Stefan.

673
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,700
Come on. Get control of it.
Come on.

674
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,470
It's ok. Come on.

675
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,290
Breathe through it, man.

676
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,080
Stefan, stop it!

677
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,610
It's ok.

678
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,770
Stefan.

679
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,240
She doesn't remember
what happened.

680
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,119
It's a good thing the girls
got here when they did.

681
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,240
She lost a lot of blood.

682
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,130
You didn't see anything?

683
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,179
No. We just found her

684
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,430
And then called Damon.

685
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,070
She gonna be ok?

686
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,040
Looks like it, yeah.

687
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,130
Why don't you girls
get back to the party.

688
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,120
Damon and I can take it from here.

689
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:35,820
Yeah. Ok.

690
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,540
They didn't see the bite mark?

691
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,599
No, I got here before
they got too close.

692
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
There was too much blood,
they couldn't see it clearly.

693
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,989
Bonnie, can we talk about this?

694
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,190
There's nothing to talk about.

695
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,910
Bonnie, please.

696
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,110
I told you I wasn't going
to make you choose,

697
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,850
But I need to make the
choice for myself.

698
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,160
Please just leave me alone.

699
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,670
Jer.

700
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,670
You ready?

701
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,140
Uh, just a second.

702
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,100
Who's that girl with Jeremy?

703
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,180
His friend Anna.

704
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,440
What's her story?

705
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,589
Why so nosy? I'm just curious.

706
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,660
He really seems to like her.

707
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,900
She's new in town, I think.

708
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,580
She and her mom, Pearl.

709
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,889
The family you're so
rudely trying to prevent

710
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,150
From buying Grayson's building.

711
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,540
Her mother's name is Pearl?

712
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,170
Yes, so?

713
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,040
Well, I believe I already
know all about her.

714
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,510
Oh, good, there you are.
Jenna wanted me

715
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,900
To get the car.

716
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,610
What happened?

717
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,560
All right, now this
is getting weird.

718
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,600
We're here to talk.

719
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,369
I'm not in the mood. Today's been

720
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,750
A no-good, very bad day.

721
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,299
Annabelle tells me you're
looking for something

722
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,630
I took from Johnathan Gilbert.

723
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,220
I'm listening.

724
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:30,850
What is that?

725
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:33,120
Johnathan was passionate
about his inventions.

726
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,829
He confided in me that he had
created a detection device

727
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,340
Meant to track down the
town's vampire element.

728
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,800
It was a pocket watch.

729
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,570
That's what it turned
out to be, yes.

730
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,900
But that's not what I stole.

731
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,990
I discovered my mistake when I
saw the watch in Johnathan's hand

732
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,630
The night they took us.

733
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,640
Its dial pointed at me.

734
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,140
So what is this? I have no idea.

735
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,660
But now it's yours.

736
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,380
What's the catch?

737
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,550
There's no catch.

738
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,540
My daughter wants to stay here.

739
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,770
I want to stay here.

740
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,340
You refuse to trust us,
and for good reason.

741
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,040
Consider this an apology.

742
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,670
You shouldn't be here.

743
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,050
I know.

744
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,960
Now you know.

745
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,250
That wasn't you.

746
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,160
Oh, it was absolutely me.

747
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,719
A monster, a predator

748
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,690
It's who I am, Elena.

749
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,659
That's what the blood makes you.

750
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,600
The blood brings out
what's inside of me.

751
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,840
And if you think any differently,
then you're an idiot.

752
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
I know this isn't you, Stefan.

753
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,270
I wanted to drain

754
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,960
Every ounce of blood
from that girl's body.

755
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,779
- No.
- It's who I am, Elena.

756
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,500
No. You can't scare me off.

757
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,449
Why would you risk it?

758
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,110
Why would you come here?

759
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:20,470
Because I did this.

760
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,139
This is my fault.

761
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,350
I'm the one who made you
drink the blood.

762
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,369
All you did was expose
me to who I really am.

763
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,289
This isn't you.

764
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,170
Stop saying that!

765
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,789
Don't get any closer to me.

766
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,240
I'm not going
to let this happen to you.

767
00:39:36,297 --> 00:39:37,140
Stop.

768
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,950
Stefan, I'm not going
to give up on you.

769
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,998
I believe in you.

770
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:40,880
Stop!

771
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,200
Stop!

772
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,160
I'm so sorry.

773
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,840
It's ok.

774
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,050
It's ok.

775
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,630
I don't know what's
happening to me.

776
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,270
It's ok, Stefan, shhh.

777
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,410
It's ok.

778
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,140
It's ok.

779
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,590
You're gonna be ok.

780
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,860
Sure you want to do this?

781
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,980
I'm sure.

782
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,580
There's no guarantee
this is going to work.

783
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,530
It has to.

784
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,030
You comin'?

785
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:09,823
I'm gonna stay here.

For over a century,
I have lived in secret.

3
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:06,051
Until now. I know the risk.

4
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:07,119
But I have to know her

5
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:09,121
Elena... she's a dead
ringer for Katherine.

6
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:10,923
I want you all to myself.

7
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,858
Just as he wants me, but I'm the one.

8
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:14,526
Who gets to make all the rules.

9
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:15,961
Go get the sheriff. We have a vampire.

10
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:17,162
No. Don't take her!

11
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,564
You'll be killed along with them.

12
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,332
Then let me be killed.

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,800
Damn it. We'll get her back.

14
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:23,402
Don't you think that you've done enough?

15
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,970
Stefan's still
drinking human blood.

16
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:26,405
Aah! Stefan!

17
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:27,406
Stefan.

18
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:29,475
Blood brings out what's inside of me.

19
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,310
I'm not gonna give up on you, Stefan.

20
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:33,979
I believe in you. Stop! Stop!

21
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:36,248
Stop! I'm so sorry.

22
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:39,751
It's OK. You're gonna be OK.

23
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,214
Uhh.

24
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:19,057
We have to get to the
church. They're waiting.

25
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,693
Circle around that
way. I'll distract them.

26
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:23,128
Go.

27
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:26,999
Over here!

28
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,600
There's another one! Quick!

29
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:30,402
Help me!

30
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,204
Arm yourselves.

31
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:42,748
Uhh!

32
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,253
We don't have long.

33
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:50,622
Katherine.

34
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,191
Katherine.

35
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:04,603
We're gonna get you out of here.

36
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:08,207
Damon, hurry. Hurry.

37
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,844
Aah!

38
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:14,680
No!

39
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:17,816
No.

40
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:24,957
Damon. Oh...

41
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:29,695
Come on. Let's go.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,334
Uhh!

43
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,683
Stefan.

44
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:57,656
Stefan.

45
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:02,227
I love you, Stefan.

00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:54,212
It's so hard to see
him locked up like this.

48
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,114
You're the one who locked him up.

49
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:57,683
You helped.

50
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,018
I couldn't have him running
around chewing on people.

51
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,721
While the town was looking
for vampires, now, could I?

52
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,856
It had nothing to do with
you actually caring about him.

53
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:07,492
Your thing, not mine.

54
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:56,141
Katherine had me make
that for you weeks ago.

55
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,977
- Where am I? 
- The quarry just north of town.

56
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,813
My brother and I brought
you here last night.

57
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:04,716
We found you dead in the woods.

58
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,785
Where's Damon?

59
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,029
Am I... am I a... not yet.

60
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:20,065
You're in transition.

61
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,600
But how? I...

62
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:24,136
You had Katherine's blood
in your system when you died.

63
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:25,771
No. I never...

64
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:28,874
She's been compelling you to
drink it for weeks, Stefan.

65
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:32,644
And Damon?

66
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,880
No compulsion was necessary.

67
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,783
He drank from her willingly.

68
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:02,974
I woke up last night. I
didn't know where I was.

69
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:04,976
I went to the church.

70
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:07,913
And I watched them drag her inside.

71
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,850
Then they set fire to it.

72
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,086
And the whole church went up into flames.

73
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:20,992
They killed her, Stefan.

74
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,931
She's gone.

75
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:33,338
Did you ever
figure out what that is?

76
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:35,574
Nope. Whatever it is, it doesn't work.

77
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:38,009
Pearl didn't say anything else about it?

78
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,145
She thought she was
stealing his vampire compass,

79
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,147
but it was a pocket watch.

80
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:45,517
That Johnathan Gilbert
was a crazy scientist.

81
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,820
Have you spoken to your uncle lately?

82
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:51,323
I've been avoiding him, actually.

83
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,758
That, and I've been here most nights.

84
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:55,894
So, you'll be here again tonight?

85
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,762
Is that a problem?

86
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,364
Yes.

87
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,132
You're a complete nuisance.

88
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:03,468
Heh. See you later.

89
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:15,447
Hey. Surprise.

90
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:17,282
What are you doing here?

91
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,651
Picking up this.

92
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,354
A class schedule?

93
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,023
Starting tomorrow, I'm
officially a student here.

94
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,925
You're kidding me, right?

95
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:30,462
No. I finally beat my mom down. Heh.

96
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,464
But why would you want to go 
to high school?

97
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,299
It blows.

98
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,669
Do I really need to answer that?

99
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,542
You'd suffer through all
this just to hang out with me?

100
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:45,043
Yeah.

101
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,778
I would.

102
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:48,980
That's, um...

103
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,949
Stupid? Pathetic?

104
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:53,184
Old lurky me?

105
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:55,420
It's awesome.

106
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,090
It's awesome.

107
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,367
Brought you something to eat...

108
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:12,237
100% Stefan diet approved.

109
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:15,040
You know what will
happen if you don't eat.

110
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:17,409
You'll get all rotting and crusty.

111
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:18,710
I'm not hungry.

112
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:20,312
Of course you are.

113
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:22,447
We're eternally hungry. Take it.

114
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:26,785
The human blood should be gone by now.

115
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:28,653
You want to explain why
you're still in here.

116
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,422
Feeling sorry for yourself?

117
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:33,692
Come on. Drink up.

118
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,569
Fine. Starve.

119
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:46,304
What do I care?

120
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:51,443
Hello?

121
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,178
Hey, it's Alaric Saltzman.

122
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:54,713
Before I hang up, how
did you get this number?

123
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,781
Ah, it's a mystery. 
Listen, I've, uh,

124
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:59,017
been doing some digging on Elena's uncle.

125
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:01,286
You interested? What kind of digging?

126
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,355
I've got an old friend from Duke.

127
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:05,256
Who studied criminology
when we were there together.

128
00:09:05,324 --> 00:09:07,993
Let's just say he's become
a very proficient digger.

129
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,928
Well, did he find anything, by chance?

130
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:12,731
Well, I had him run a track
on John's cell records.

131
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,399
He was getting a call from a number...

132
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,468
The same number that
Elena dialed to get Isobel.

133
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,169
And then the number was disconnected.

134
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:20,639
- Isobel knows John. 
- Whatever. We knew that.

135
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:22,974
Right. Well, after that, he started
getting calls from a new number.

136
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:24,643
And I had my friend run a geotrack.

137
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,245
Got the address. It's...

138
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,247
It's an apartment in Grove Hill.

139
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:31,316
Isobel's in Grove Hill?

140
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:33,585
I don't know. I thought we could
take a look and see what we find.

141
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,186
Perfect. Give me the address.

142
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:37,956
Oh, so you can go without
me? No. I don't think so.

143
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:39,724
I'm not going with you.
You tried to kill me.

144
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,226
Yeah, well, you did kill me.

145
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,796
Hold on. What?

146
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,399
I'm just grabbing some clothes,
and then I'll be right over.

147
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,434
- How's Stefan? 
- Extra broody.

148
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:50,769
Hold on.

149
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:52,504
You drive. Pick me up in an hour.

150
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:53,938
Done.

151
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:58,810
He won't eat anything.

152
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:01,179
He has to ea what's his favorite...

153
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:02,847
Kind of, um...

154
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:05,116
His favorite kind of what?

155
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,118
Type of animal blood that he prefers?

156
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:08,653
Ew. Gross.

157
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,522
Heh. Your joking doesn't help.

158
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,090
Helps me. Now, hurry up.

159
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:14,592
I can't baby-sit all
night. I have things to do.

160
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,261
I would say, "drop dead," but...

161
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,762
Ha ha.

162
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,031
Stefan likes...

163
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,533
Puppy blood...

164
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,369
Little golden retriever
puppies with cute, fluffy ears.

165
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:26,171
That's his favorite.

166
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:34,946
Sorry.

167
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,648
Uncle John.

168
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,616
I didn't see you there.

169
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:42,020
I thought we could talk. We
haven't had a chance to catch up.

170
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:45,356
I'm actually just heading out, so...

171
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:48,326
Well, it won't take long.

172
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:51,296
What did you want to talk about?

173
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,331
Well...

174
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,166
I know you know.

175
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:56,868
Know what?

176
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:59,003
It's really silly to keep pretending.

177
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:01,639
What do you think your mother would say.

178
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:04,843
If she knew you were dating a vampire?

179
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,780
Which mother?

180
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:27,332
I bet Johnathan Gilbert
has told father by now.

181
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,968
Wonder how he took the
news that we're dead.

182
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:32,604
As if he cares. He betrayed us.

183
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,606
He thought he was protecting us, Damon.

184
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,008
He thought he was protecting this town.

185
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:38,143
God.

186
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,245
This sun hurts my eyes.

187
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:42,781
It's part of it.

188
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:44,649
The muscle aches, the sick feeling...

189
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,685
Emily says it's our
bods pushing us to feed,

190
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:50,255
to complete the transition.

191
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:52,757
That's not gonna happen.

192
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,226
Is that your choice, then?

193
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:56,761
To die instead?

194
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,663
Isn't it yours?

195
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:02,333
This was all to be with Katherine.

196
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,068
But she's gone.

197
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:06,437
I want it over.

198
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,609
How you feelin'?

199
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,212
Damon says you need to drink that.

200
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:17,882
You need it, Stefan.

201
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,717
Can't survive without it.

202
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:22,620
- I don't want to survive. 
- What?

203
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,924
- No, don't say that. 
- I'm sorry, Elena.

204
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:27,458
No more.

205
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:31,396
After what I've done, it has to end.

206
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:34,299
I just want it over.

207
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:40,716
He's just being dramatic.

208
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:42,317
He's not gonna starve himself.

209
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:43,819
Why would he say that?

210
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:45,320
He feels bad about hurting that girl.

211
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:47,589
It's a very typical step of martyr stuff.

212
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:49,357
- It will pass. 
- Will it?

213
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:52,027
Because he seemed to be in lot of pain.

214
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,229
Yeah. Well, that will
pass, too, once he eats.

215
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:56,465
I didn't mean physical pain.

216
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:58,400
I know what you meant.

217
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:00,969
Look, are you gonna be OK here if run out?

218
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:02,838
I have to go to an
errand with the teacher.

219
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:04,473
The teacher?

220
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,209
Alaric? Are you two friends now?

221
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:09,478
I don't have any friends, Elena.

222
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:12,447
Right.

223
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:14,516
You should, um,

224
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:17,586
you should stay up here. You
shouldn't be down there by yourself.

225
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:19,121
I'll be fine.

226
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:20,889
You know...

227
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:24,459
You're very trusting of
him, given the circumstances.

228
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:27,129
So are you.

229
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:30,132
Otherwise, you wouldn't be leaving.

230
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,368
I won't be long.

231
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:46,681
Hello, Mr. Gilbert.

232
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,917
Pearl. What a pleasure.

233
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:51,720
I must admit, I'm surprised that you came.

234
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:54,856
Jenna tells me that you wanted to discuss
the sale of the building in person.

235
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:57,559
Still, revealing yourself to me
like this, it took quite a risk.

236
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,961
I'm not stupid, Mr. Gilbert.

237
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:02,464
You knew who I was when
you requested the meeting.

238
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,368
So, Damon tells me that
you're looking for the device

239
00:14:06,435 --> 00:14:08,236
I took from Johnathan.

240
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:10,839
I'm sure you realize I have no
intention of giving it to you.

241
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,974
That's why I wanted to meet you.

242
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,010
I'm planning on changing your mind.

243
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:17,145
Really? How so?

244
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:19,481
With my Gilbert charm.

245
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:23,051
I know that you have a weakness for it.

246
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:26,922
May I buy you a drink?

247
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,493
So, your mother was
in love with Johnathan Gilbert,

248
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:33,795
and he betrayed her? Yup.

249
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:35,864
And now my uncle John.

250
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:38,033
Wants this invention-device thing.

251
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,668
That she gave to Damon.

252
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:42,204
That's pretty much it.

253
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:44,439
John mentioned there were
more Gilbert journals.

254
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:47,375
I bet that's how he knows everything.

255
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:49,344
Do we have to talk about ts all night?

256
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:52,214
I've told you everything.

257
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,082
I probably shouldn't have,

258
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,117
'cause that could get us
both in a lot of trouble.

259
00:14:57,954 --> 00:14:59,955
I'm not gonna say anything.

260
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:02,657
Your uncle John wants us dead.

261
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,227
Oh, you don't know that.

262
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:06,995
Yes, I do.

263
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:08,997
He's a hater, Jeremy.

264
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:11,099
Well, I'm not.

265
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,701
No.

266
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:14,769
You're something else entirely.

267
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:17,239
Oh, yeah? What would that be?

268
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:21,243
My weakness.

269
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:52,107
I don't want Jenna to walk in on us.

270
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,843
Jenna's in the kitchen.

271
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,645
She just opened the refrigerator.

272
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:59,347
Wait. You can hear that?

273
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:02,384
That is so cool.

274
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,155
This is the one here.

275
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:09,624
The records show is was
paid 3 months in advance.

276
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,293
This is where it gets tricky.

277
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,628
I may or may not be able to get in.

278
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:16,331
Yeah, how does that work? You
always have to be invited in?

279
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,466
By the owner or the person of entitlement.

280
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:21,569
Short-term rentals and hotels
are a bit of a gray area.

281
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:23,538
You kind of gotta play it by ear.

282
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,273
Heh.

283
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:27,876
Could we not kill anyone tonight, please?

284
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:30,779
You mean, you just brought
me along for my company?

285
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:38,486
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

286
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:42,624
Yeah. I'm good.

287
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:46,928
No permanent resident, apparently.

288
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:56,972
Uh, Rick, we have company.

289
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,685
Boys, boys, that's enough.

290
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:12,620
I know you.

291
00:17:13,622 --> 00:17:14,723
Damon?

292
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,558
Your name is Henry. You were in the tomb.

293
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,560
Yes, sir.

294
00:17:18,627 --> 00:17:21,463
What are you doing here?

295
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:40,715
May I offer
you a drink, Mr. Gilbert?

296
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:42,617
Thank you, Mr. Salvatore.

297
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:45,020
This won't take much longer.

298
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:49,624
I want to make sure the
founder's archives are accurate.

299
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:52,594
Be sure you document the loss
of civilian life in the church.

300
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,729
They were hardly civilians, . Salvatore.

301
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:57,399
As far as anyone needs to know, they were.

302
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:59,401
As the record keeper for the council,

303
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:02,404
what you write will be passed
down through generations.

304
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:04,706
Certain details should be
kept only between you and me.

305
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:05,874
For example?

306
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,642
My sons.

307
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,013
They will be remembered the innocent
victims of the battle of willow creek,

308
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:13,782
not for their shame.

309
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:15,483
Certainly, Mr. Salvatore.

310
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:25,427
You know, Damon hasn't
fed me vervain in a while.

311
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:28,263
I could be at those bars
in flash, and you'd be dead.

312
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,198
Yeah, you could.

313
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:32,100
But you won't.

314
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:34,669
Please just go away.

315
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:37,439
I don't want you here.

316
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:45,947
What are you doing?

317
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:47,382
- Get out of here. 
- No.

318
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,517
You're taking a stupid
risk. I could hurt you.

319
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:51,786
Then I'm stupid.

320
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:54,155
You need to drink this.

321
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:57,092
Elena, get out of here,
or you'll regret it.

322
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,494
Drink.

323
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:02,997
I said get out!

324
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
No.

325
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:29,744
So, how do you know John Gilbert?

326
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:32,280
Well, I've known him for years.

327
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:34,782
He's a good friend. How do you know him?

328
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,585
I met him right after
I got out of the tomb.

329
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:39,987
He's been helping me
out. Helping you out how?

330
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:43,057
Adapting. It's a whole new world...

331
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,260
Cars, computers, match.com.

332
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:49,830
There's so much to learn.
He helped me get this place.

333
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,700
So, do you live here alone,

334
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:55,069
or is there someone else here?

335
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:58,639
That's my friend's very...
Passive-aggressive way of asking,

336
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:01,375
uh, do you know a woman named Isobel?

337
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:04,278
Uh, no. No, I don't know an Isobel.

338
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:07,281
I know John. He's my only real friend.

339
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:10,184
He really showed me the
ropes... how to use a microwave,

340
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,686
separate my whites.

341
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,054
What else do you do for him?

342
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:15,389
I help keep an eye on things...
You know, with the others.

343
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:17,525
The others? From the tomb.

344
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,393
They're still pissed at
the founding families.

345
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:20,962
For trying to burn them alive.

346
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,798
I'm cool, but those tomb
boys, they want revenge.

347
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,366
What does John want with them?

348
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,401
He's just keeping an
eye on them, you know?

349
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:29,036
Trying to make sure
they stay out of trouble.

350
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,472
Well, that's John. Heh.
He's such a do-gooder.

351
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:36,310
Heh. That's John now.

352
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:38,679
Oh. Hey, let me talk to him.

353
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,815
All right. Yeah.

354
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,555
Are you gonna answer that?

355
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,891
Am I gonna... answer that?

356
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,830
What's going on?

357
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:00,301
Uhh! Uhh!

358
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:01,669
Aah!

359
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:10,644
"Let's not
not kill anyone tonight."

360
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:13,314
Your words. Just pointing that out.

361
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,951
My apologies.

362
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:18,953
No apologies necessary.

363
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:22,390
So, tell me, Mr. Gilbert, why
should I let you have the device?

364
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:25,092
Because I can help you.
I'm connected around here.

365
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,195
The town council's eating out of
my land. They do whatever I say.

366
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,264
And I know that you just
want to live your life.

367
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,500
Complete with a white picket
fence, and I can help you do that.

368
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,136
But the device doesn't work.
Why would you even want it?

369
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,938
It's a family heirloom.
Call me sentimental.

370
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,408
Johnathan was ahead of his time.

371
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:42,877
I read his journals.
They're very extensive.

372
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,545
He actually wrote about you.

373
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:46,947
You were his one regret.

374
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,985
He loved you, and he hated
himself for what he did to you.

375
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:53,721
- You're lying. 
- No.

376
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,525
On his last days, he
wrote how sorry he was.

377
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:01,328
You were the only woman he ever loved.

378
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,437
Good God.

379
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:13,541
You vampires... you're so emotional.

380
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,576
Johnathan Gilbert hated you.

381
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:19,780
His only regret was that he didn't
drive a stake through your heart himself.

382
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,453
- I gave it to Damon. 
- What?

383
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,321
I gave your device to Damon.

384
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,156
Why don't you ask him for it yourself?

385
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:32,593
I'm sure he'd be delighted to give
it to you. And then, Mr. Gilbert,

386
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:34,895
may you rot in hell.

387
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,901
Talk to me, Stefan.

388
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,470
Why are you doing this?

389
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:46,073
I'm making the decision I
should have made years ago.

390
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:48,275
What are you talking about?

391
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:52,813
You have to feed in order
to complete the transition.

392
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:55,516
I know that.

393
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:59,053
It was a choice I shouldn't have made.

394
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:10,564
Dear God.

395
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:13,067
Even in our death, you only feel shame?

396
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:15,436
- You're one of them now. 
- No.

397
00:23:15,504 --> 00:23:17,571
Father, I came to say good-bye.

398
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,640
I watched you die.

399
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,976
You were there when we were shot?

400
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:23,978
I pulled the trigger myself.

401
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:26,347
You killed your own sons?

402
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:29,250
You were both dead to me the
moment you sided with the vampires.

403
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:32,253
I only thank God that your mother isn't
alive to see the disgrace you've become.

404
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,522
I haven't turned yet. I don't want to.

405
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:36,457
I'm going to let myself
die, father. Please.

406
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:38,092
Yes, you are.

407
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:45,533
Uhh!

408
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,835
Father, I didn't mean to.

409
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:50,804
- Get away from me. 
- No, let me help you. Please.

410
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:15,529
Ohh.

411
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:26,407
Ohh.

412
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:31,178
Uhh. Uhh!

413
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:33,814
Oh, God. What's happening to me?

414
00:24:38,863 --> 00:24:40,931
How can you even look at me right now?

415
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:44,368
You need to be able talk
about these things, Stefan.

416
00:24:44,436 --> 00:24:47,304
I need to hear them.

417
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:49,573
Come upstairs.

418
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:50,974
We can talk about it more,

419
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:53,544
and we'll keep talking
as long as you need.

420
00:24:55,513 --> 00:24:57,848
You're so sure I'm ready.

421
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:07,491
And when you feel the same way...

422
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,793
I'll be upstairs.

423
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:24,775
Find anything yet?

424
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:26,777
No, I looked everywhere. The place is...

425
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:28,846
The place is clean. Well, I found this.

426
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:30,748
Behind the blood in the fridge.

427
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:35,586
Oh, man, this was a real dead-end.

428
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:37,521
I wouldn't beat myself up over it, man.

429
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:40,190
What did you think you
were gonna find, huh?

430
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:43,494
Isobel with a cigar and slippers?

431
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:49,133
Oh, man. I...

432
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,237
I gotta stop this. I can't...
I can't keep searching for her.

433
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:55,439
Really? After only 2 years?

434
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:57,975
That's actually...

435
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:00,010
Moderately healthy.

436
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:02,713
What are you going on? 146?

437
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:05,616
Well, I figure the 200 mark is
probably a good stopping point.

438
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:10,053
Ahh.

439
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:12,022
I mean, no answer is enough.

440
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,891
I keep thinking I wanna kn why,

441
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,626
when, you know, the precise moment.

442
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:19,229
When my wife decided life
with me wasn't enough.

443
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:23,233
She charmed me, your wife Isobel.

444
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,202
She talked a good game, man.

445
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,071
She was smart. She had
this excitement in her eyes.

446
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:30,440
I probably should have known there
was something different about her,

447
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:32,176
some tie to Katherine.

448
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:34,144
There had to be some
reason I didn't kill her.

449
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:36,180
That's enough, Damon. I
don't wanna hear anymore.

450
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:38,882
I just don't want to
waste any more of my life.

451
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,618
Searching for answers
that I really don't want.

452
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:47,224
I'm through with Isobel. I...

453
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm done with all of this.

454
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:53,063
Yeah.

455
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,876
Hey.

456
00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:07,644
What's the matter?

457
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:09,813
I need you to pack your
things. We're leaving.

458
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:11,682
What? No.

459
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:14,251
I was wrong to think that
we could make a home here.

460
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,286
It's time for us to move on.

461
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:18,822
But I don't want to
move on. I want to stay.

462
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,357
We can't stay.

463
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:23,093
There's too many people
here who know the truth...

464
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,528
Too much history.

465
00:27:24,596 --> 00:27:26,496
So, what, you're just gonna give up,

466
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:28,332
pack us up, and move us out?

467
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,467
It's not safe here. You know that.

468
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:32,502
Please.

469
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,771
This is about Jeremy.

470
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,340
No. It's about me.

471
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:39,843
Finally getting to
build a life for myself.

472
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:41,378
Please, mama.

473
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:45,515
You gave me my life back. I am
just trying to protect yours.

474
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:49,620
I can't force you.

475
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:52,155
It's your decision.

476
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:01,231
Ugh. God. You're still here?

477
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:04,034
Were you expecting anything else? No.

478
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:05,903
Ahh.

479
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,472
So, how was the "errand"?

480
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,007
Futile.

481
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:12,009
Although, I think I
witnessed the teacher having.

482
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:13,844
An existential crisis.

483
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:15,112
Has Stefan eaten yet?

484
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,813
I thought you didn't care.

485
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:19,316
Chalk it up to morbid curiosity.

486
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:22,319
I think he's getting there.

487
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:24,888
But he's got a lot of guilt
that he has to deal with.

488
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:28,091
And it doesn't help that
you've spent the last 145 years.

489
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,994
Punishing him for
Katherine getting caught.

490
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:32,462
This is my fault now?

491
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,364
No, it's no one's fault, Damon.

492
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,067
I'm just... saying you're
not exactly innocent.

493
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:40,871
You've made it your life's
mission to make him miserable.

494
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:45,309
Let me ask you a question.

495
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:47,010
In all this important soul-searching.

496
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:48,979
And cleansing of the
demons of Stefan's past,

497
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:51,248
did you ever manage to
get e rest of the story?

498
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:53,450
He said there was more.

499
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:56,019
Yeah. That's an understatement.

500
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:57,487
Damon...

501
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:59,656
Damon.

502
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:01,692
Tell me.

503
00:29:11,636 --> 00:29:14,871
What are you doing? Who is that?

504
00:29:14,939 --> 00:29:16,873
I brought her for you.

505
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:20,644
She's a gift. Have a seat, please.

506
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:25,983
What have you done, Stefan?

507
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,452
Damon, I've been to see father.

508
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,886
He came at me.

509
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:34,291
I didn't know my own strength.
There was blood everywhere.

510
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,227
He was dying, and the
blood was too strong.

511
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:40,097
I needed it. I had to have it.

512
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:42,766
- You fed. 
- Yes. And it's incredible.

513
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:46,870
My body is exploding
with power, Damon. No.

514
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:49,172
I can hear things from far away.

515
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,776
I can see through the darkness.
I can move, like it's magic.

516
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:55,679
And the guilt, the pain...
Damon, I can turn it off.

517
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:57,347
Like a switch.

518
00:29:57,415 --> 00:30:00,484
Katherine was right. It's a whole
another world out there, Damon.

519
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,086
Katherine is dead, Stefan.

520
00:30:03,154 --> 00:30:05,589
- There's no world without her. 
- No.

521
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:07,324
You can turn that off, too.

522
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:09,393
You don't have to feel that pain anymore.

523
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,794
I don't want it.

524
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:12,929
You're weak. You'll be dead soon.

525
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:14,831
You need this.

526
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:16,933
No. You'll die.

527
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:19,569
No. I can't.

528
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:21,605
Please.

529
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:34,851
I won't let you die.

530
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,253
No. I can't.

531
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,854
Don't fight it.

532
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:41,324
We can do this... together.

533
00:31:15,293 --> 00:31:18,462
From the moment Stefan had
his first taste of human blood,

534
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,363
he was a different person.

535
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,299
I suppose I should thank him.

536
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:24,868
It's been a hell of a ride. Heh.

537
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:28,071
Oh, my God. He said he wanted to die.

538
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:30,974
That's why he wot feed.
Now I understand why, but...

539
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,476
His choice.

540
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:35,946
If he's stupid enough
to make it, so be it.

541
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:40,050
Don't do that. Ok? Don't
pretend like you don't care.

542
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:44,121
Where are you going?

543
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,159
Hey.

544
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:17,762
It's getting impossible
to sneak up on you.

545
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,664
Nice try, though.

546
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:22,233
Sorry I woke you.

547
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:24,202
That's OK.

548
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,038
You only woke me halfway.

549
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:33,511
So, listen. I...

550
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,913
That feels good.

551
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,767
Good-bye.

552
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:20,358
How do you feel?

553
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:22,360
You were right.

554
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:24,595
It is a whole new world.

555
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:26,931
We can explore it together.

556
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:33,371
You got what you wanted...
You and me for all eternity.

557
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:36,774
But here it is, brother.

558
00:33:36,842 --> 00:33:39,844
I will make it an eternity.

559
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:42,647
Of misery for you.

560
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:45,183
Damon!

561
00:33:56,695 --> 00:33:59,097
You've transitioned.

562
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:02,800
You'd have rather found me dead?

563
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:06,137
Katherine saved my life once. I owed her.

564
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:08,973
That doesn't mean I'd
wish her curse on anyone.

565
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:12,276
It feels more like a gift.

566
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:15,713
- That will change. 
- Why is that?

567
00:34:20,085 --> 00:34:22,019
Because even in death,

568
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:24,388
your heart is pure, Stefan.

569
00:34:24,456 --> 00:34:27,291
I sense that about you.

570
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:31,996
That will be your curse.

571
00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:34,999
Emily, wait.

572
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,743
Stefan.

573
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,217
Damon told me the rest of the story.

574
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:56,220
I thought I might find you here.

575
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:58,556
I should have died that night,

576
00:34:58,624 --> 00:35:02,560
just like I had chosen.

577
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:05,163
I should have let Damon die, too.

578
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,999
But you didn't. And if you die now,

579
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,968
it's not gonna change what happened.

580
00:35:11,036 --> 00:35:15,406
Every single person that's been hurt...

581
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:19,277
Every single life that's
been lost, it's because of me.

582
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:27,018
The night that my parents died...

583
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:31,222
I blew off family night so that
I could go off to some party.

584
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,826
I ended up getting stranded,
and they had to come pick me up.

585
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:38,362
That's why we ended up in
the car at Wickery bridge.

586
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,132
And that's why they died.

587
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,469
Our actions are what set things in motion.

588
00:35:45,537 --> 00:35:48,506
But we have to live with that.

589
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:54,645
I made a choice, Elena.

590
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:57,849
And because of that choice,
a lot of people were hurt.

591
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:59,684
You also made a choice to stop,

592
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,752
to reject the person
that the blood made you.

593
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,421
- You made a choice to be good, Stefan. 
- No.

594
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:05,556
Please don't do that. That's the person

595
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:07,792
who jumped in the water
to save the family

596
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,794
whose car had driven
off the bridge. Please.

597
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:11,996
Don't make this all OK. That's the person.

598
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:14,799
- Who saved my life.
- You don't understand, Elena.

599
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:17,201
Then tell me. It hurts me.

600
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:20,104
It hurts me, knowing what
I've done, and that pain...

601
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:22,273
That pain is with me all the time.

602
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:25,209
And every day, I think that if I just...

603
00:36:25,277 --> 00:36:28,012
If just give myself over to the blood,

604
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,781
I can make that pain stop.

605
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:33,985
It would be that easy, and
every day, I fight that.

606
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:37,355
And I am so terrified that one day,

607
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:40,124
I'm not gonna want to
fight that anymore, Elena.

608
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,629
And the next time I hurt somebody...

609
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:46,797
It could be you.

610
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:48,666
There will be no next time.

611
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:50,668
You don't know that.

612
00:36:50,736 --> 00:36:53,070
Maybe I don't.

613
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:55,840
But what I do know.

614
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:58,175
Is that you can take this,

615
00:36:58,243 --> 00:37:01,078
throw it in the quarry,
and let the sun rise.

616
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,215
Or you could take this ring and put it on.

617
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,784
And keep fighting.

618
00:37:19,398 --> 00:37:22,033
It's your choice.

619
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,778
Elena.

620
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:11,159
- Thank you, Harper. 
- You're welcome

621
00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:12,961
Annabelle should be back in a minute.

622
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:15,797
You know, you don't have to come
with us if you don't want to.

623
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:17,665
This was never my home, miss pearl.

624
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:19,634
I was just a soldier who was left to die.

625
00:38:19,702 --> 00:38:22,137
You saved me. I'm coming with you.

626
00:38:22,204 --> 00:38:24,439
Let me help you with these.

627
00:38:53,335 --> 00:38:55,770
- I'll be upstairs, OK?
- Ok.

628
00:38:56,872 --> 00:38:59,340
Good night, Damon.

629
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:07,982
- Thank you. 
- No, Stefan, thank you.

630
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,618
You're back on Bambi blood, and
I'm the big badass brother again.

631
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:12,620
All is right in the world.

632
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:14,122
I mean it.

633
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,824
Thank you.

634
00:39:15,891 --> 00:39:18,626
For... helping her take care of me.

635
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:21,696
You brood too much. Everything
on this planet is not your fault.

636
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:23,631
My actions, what I do,
it's not your fault.

637
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,433
I own them. They belong to me.

638
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:27,669
You are not allowed to feel my guilt.

639
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:30,939
Do you feel guilt?

640
00:39:31,006 --> 00:39:32,874
If I wanted to,

641
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:34,876
it's there.

642
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:48,623
Emily waited till after I turned
to tell me she'd been successful.

643
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:50,558
In protecting Katherine with her spell.

644
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:52,827
She didn't want me to know about the tomb.

645
00:39:52,895 --> 00:39:55,096
She thought it would impact my decision.

646
00:39:55,164 --> 00:39:57,499
She didn't want either one of us to turn.

647
00:39:57,566 --> 00:40:00,201
She said it was a curse. Witches...

648
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:02,637
Judgy little things.

649
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,205
Why didn't you tell me?

650
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:06,141
'Cause I didn't want you to know.

651
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,243
'Cause I hated you, and I still do.

652
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:11,212
I know.

653
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,848
But not because you forced me to turn.

654
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,317
Then why?

655
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,057
Because she turned you.

656
00:40:24,393 --> 00:40:27,862
It was just supposed to be me, Stefan...

657
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,564
Just me.

658
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:37,038
I'm back.

659
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:41,509
Oh!

660
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:43,478
Mom! Mama!

661
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:48,883
Uhh!

662
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:51,653
Please don't leave me again.

663
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,822
No. Please wake up. You have to wake up.

664
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,893
No.

665
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:10,405
Sheriff Forbes, John Gilbert.

666
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:12,407
Sorry to call so late.

667
00:41:12,474 --> 00:41:15,243
I have an update about the vampires.

668
00:41:25,054 --> 00:41:27,222
Hello, Rick.

669
00:41:36,065 --> 00:41:38,133
Isobel.

Previously on
"the vampire diaries"...

2
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:04,269
Stefan: for over a century,
i have lived in secret

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,770
Until now.
I know the risk.

4
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,138
But i have to know her.

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,307
The original
johnathan gilbert
had an invention

6
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:11,109
That was stolen
by a vampire.
Her name was pearl.

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,810
I gave your device to damon.

8
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,445
Why don't you
ask him for it yourself?

9
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:18,783
Mom! Mama!

10
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,451
My wife isobel
spent her life

11
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:22,654
Researching paranormal
activity in this area.

12
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,522
What have you done to my wife?
I turned her.

13
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,257
Why do i look like her?

14
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:28,293
You were adopted.
This girl showed up,

15
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,094
16 and about to give birth.

16
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:32,096
What else do you know
about her?

17
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:34,098
Just her name--Isobel.
Stop looking.

18
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:36,167
She doesn't want
to know you.

19
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:38,569
She's alive?
Does that mean
she's a--

20
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:42,106
Woman: hello, rick.

21
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,642
Isobel.

22
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:49,247
It's good to see you.

23
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,349
You look good.

24
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,319
I hear that you're
a high-School history teacher?

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,288
How--How is that?

26
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,624
Where have you been,
isobel?

27
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,528
I don't have any reasons
that are gonna comfort you.

28
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:08,666
I don't have any explanations
that are gonna satisfy you.

29
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,635
I wanted this.

30
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:12,003
It's that simple?

31
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:13,538
Yeah.

32
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:17,041
You were supposed to
mourn me and move on.

33
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,644
You were my wife.

34
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:22,180
And i loved you.

35
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,782
How could i not
search for you?

36
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:29,454
Because i wasn't lost, rick.

37
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:35,360
I understand that you know
my daughter elena.
Oh.

38
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:39,931
And i hear that she's been
looking for me.

39
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:42,867
So...

40
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:44,902
I want you to arrange for
a meeting with us.

41
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:49,841
You want me...
[clears throat]

42
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:51,709
To deliver a message?

43
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,611
Heh.
Yeah.

44
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,649
Screw you...

45
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,254
You selfish bitch.

46
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:17,568
What do you want
from me?

47
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,071
I told you.
I'm not gonna
do anything for you.

48
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,979
You better tell elena
that i want to meet,

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,915
Or i'm gonna start
killing the citizens of
this town one by one,

50
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,317
And i'm gonna start with
your history students.

51
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:36,421
Got it?

52
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,622
http://www.addic7ed.com

53
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,710
I'm supposed to help build
the miss mystic float

54
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,779
For the founder's day
parade.

55
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,182
If i don't, i get
the wrath of caroline.

56
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,150
But i wanted
to check in first.

57
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:08,820
Well, i'm doing great.
Thanks for asking.

58
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,022
I'm checking on stefan.
Oh, him?

59
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:13,424
Oh. He's--He's terrible.

60
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:15,493
What's the matter?

61
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:17,995
He's just back to boring,

62
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:21,299
Strait-Laced, off the junk.
You've successfully cured him of

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,601
Anything that was interesting
about his personality.

64
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:26,103
Don't forget who helped me.
I hate myself.

65
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,175
Hey, did uncle john
mention anything to you

66
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,644
About my field trip
with the history teacher?

67
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:36,314
No, i've still been
avoiding him.
Why? What's he up to?

68
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,483
I don't know.
But i'd love it if you
could find out for me.

69
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,984
I gotta go. I'm late.

70
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,987
Have fun
with the mystic queen.
I know i did.

71
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:52,196
Elena called.

72
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,442
These are the specs
for the history
department's

73
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,077
Founder's day float.

74
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,880
We're gonna be recreating
the battle of willow creek.

75
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,115
Tyler's been nominated head
of the production design.

76
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:12,617
By who?
By me.

77
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,552
I've seen
your sketches,
and they're good.

78
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,220
Look, i'm not really
into the whole--

79
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:19,257
Yeah, well, you just
pick your team,
be creative, and...

80
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,792
And don't screw up.

81
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:23,995
Great.

82
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:26,063
You want
to help me out with this?

83
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:27,899
Not really, no.

84
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,402
Hey, mr. Saltzman.
Come with me.

85
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,204
We need to talk.

86
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,776
Let's reference
last year's
miss mystic float.

87
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:42,346
This is
what they did last year.

88
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:46,784
And it's exactly
what we don't want to do.

89
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,119
Ew.
Yeah.

90
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,855
Ok. So, what are
we doing?

91
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:53,090
Southern classic elegance.

92
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:55,393
"Gone with the wind"?
How did you know?

93
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:57,194
You channel
scarlett daily.

94
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:58,829
So true.
Yeah.

95
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:03,467
Uhh. Where's elena?
She's supposed to
be helping.

96
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:05,770
I don't know.

97
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:08,105
Ok, what's the deal?
What do you mean?

98
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:09,874
Don't play dumb.

99
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,510
You and elena
are fighting. Spill.

100
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,612
It's nothing.
It's not nothing.

101
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,614
You know, this whole float

102
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:19,550
Is supposed to be about friends
creating something together,

103
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,452
And everyone is fighting.

104
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:23,354
Matt and tyler
hate each other.

105
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:25,189
You and elena
are on the outs.

106
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,191
I--I don't like it.

107
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,796
And i can't fix it
if i don't know what's wrong.

108
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:35,199
I can't talk about it,
caroline. I'm sorry.

109
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:44,675
Damon.
Thanks for coming.

110
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:46,877
Sorry i'm late.
The dog ate my, uh...

111
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,580
Never mind.

112
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:55,386
What's all
the furrowed brows?

113
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,188
I saw isobel
last night.

114
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,858
Isobel's here?
In town?

115
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,103
You're late.

116
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:47,872
I didn't realize
there was a schedule.

117
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,473
What's with the side show?

118
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:51,409
Cherie is a little
jazz singer

119
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,678
That i picked up
in a blues bar
in brooklyn.

120
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,714
And i got the cowboy
at a gay rodeo
in amarillo.

121
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:59,283
He's gay?
Not right now.

122
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:01,018
He's very good
to me.

123
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,555
Hey, cherie?
[Speaking french]

124
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,262
I'm teaching them french.

125
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:14,999
Ooh. I can smell
the judgment
coming off of you.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,268
Well, they're people, isobel,
and you're treating them

127
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,270
Like they're dolls.
If we're gonna be partners,

128
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,906
You really have to stop
being such a hater.

129
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,308
We're in a partnership together
because we share a mutual goal.

130
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:27,478
Don't ever confuse that for
an acceptance of your lifestyle.

131
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,946
My lifestyle?

132
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:34,418
So, i assume that you still
don't have the invention.

133
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,153
I'll get it.
I said i would.

134
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:38,823
Uh, you threatened to
expose damon salvatore.

135
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:41,258
That didn't work.
You killed
that pearl lady.

136
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,094
Still no invention.

137
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,963
I really don't think
that your plan
is working, john.

138
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:48,766
Well, you being here
isn't going to help anything.

139
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:53,938
You failed, john.
I'm gonna take it
from here.

140
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:00,177
Damon: did you ask
about une john?

141
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,012
Are they working
together?
No.

142
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:03,347
No, they're not?

143
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,449
No, i didn't ask.
What about the invention?

144
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,785
Didn't ask.
Does she know
about the tomb of vampires?

145
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:10,654
I don't know.
Did words
completely escape you?

146
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:13,090
No, i was a little
too distracted by
my dead vampire wife

147
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,626
To ask any questions.
What did she want?

148
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,461
She wants
to see me, damon.

149
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,833
Alaric is supposed to
arrange a meeting.

150
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,769
We don't know why
or what she wants.

151
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,570
You don't have to see her
if you don't want to.

152
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,707
I don't really have
a choice.

153
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,776
She's threatened
to go on a killing spree.

154
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,182
I take it that's...
not ok with you guys.

155
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:41,452
I want to do it.
I want to meet her.

156
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,954
If i don't,
i know i'll regret it.

157
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:00,337
Thanks.

158
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:04,708
Can you hear me?

159
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:09,380
Thanks for coming.

160
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:12,016
I'm nervous.

161
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:16,554
But i'm happy
that you're here.

162
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,656
Love you.

163
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:38,642
Hello, elena.

164
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,735
You look just like her.
It's eerie.

165
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:46,537
You've met katherine?

166
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:49,072
She found me
after i turned.

167
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:51,375
Genetic curiosity,
i suppose.

168
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:53,810
She would be fascinated
by you.

169
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:56,847
Is that how you can
walk in the day?

170
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:59,016
Katherine helped me
obtain it.

171
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:00,817
Who's my father?

172
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:03,687
Not important.
He was a teenage waste of space.

173
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:05,689
A name would be nice.
It would, wouldn't it?

174
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,425
You ask a lot of questions.

175
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:11,094
Why did you compel
that man to kill himself

176
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:13,197
Right after he told me
to stop looking for you?

177
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:16,333
Traumatic impact.
Wish it would have been
more effective.

178
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,468
Human life means
that little to you?

179
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:20,404
Means nothing to me.

180
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:23,707
It's just part of being
what i am.

181
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:27,311
No. It's not.

182
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:29,479
I know other vampires.
That's not true.

183
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,549
Your boyfriend over there
by the pool table?

184
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,318
Stefan salvatore.

185
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:37,821
Why stefan?
Why didn't you go for damon?

186
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:41,425
Or do enjoy them both?
Like katherine did?

187
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:50,033
we should be in there.

188
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:51,868
No.
Isobel made it clear

189
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:53,737
We're not to
step foot inside.

190
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:55,539
I'm not gonna kill her
in a crowded restaurant.

191
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,441
You're not gonna
kill her, period.

192
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:59,776
She ruined your life,
and you still want
to protect her?

193
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:01,612
She's my wife.

194
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:04,248
Was--Was my wife.

195
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:06,516
I looked for
the woman i married,
but she wasn't there.

196
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:08,518
Whoever that is is...

197
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,520
Cold and detached.
[Scoffs] yeah.

198
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,756
She's given up
her humanity.

199
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:14,524
Yeah, see,
i don't get that.

200
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:17,060
Stefan has his humanity.
He's a good guy.

201
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:19,029
Oh, you're a dick
and you kill people,
but i still see

202
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,265
Something human in you.
But with her,
there was...

203
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,133
There was nothing.

204
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:26,570
You can turn it off...

205
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:28,972
Like a button you can press.
I mean, stefan's different.

206
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:31,108
He--He wants the whole
human experience.

207
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:34,044
He wants to feel every episode
of "how i met your mother,"

208
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:36,013
So he shuts his feelings out.
The problem is,

209
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:38,315
As a vampire,
your instinct is not to feel.

210
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,855
Isobel chose the easier road--

211
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:46,990
No guilt and shame...

212
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:49,192
No regret.
I mean, come on.

213
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:51,261
If you could turn it off,
wouldn't you?
You haven't.

214
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:53,196
Heh. Of course
i have, rick.

215
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:55,332
That's why i'm so fun
to be around.

216
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,103
Elena: why did you
want to meet me?

217
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:02,539
It can't be to just
catch up.

218
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,841
Because i'm curious
about you.

219
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:07,544
But the real reason is

220
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:09,479
I want
what your uncle wants--

221
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,848
Johnathan gilbert's invention.

222
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:13,950
How do you know
my uncle?

223
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,820
I used to spend a lot of time
here when i was younger.

224
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:19,122
John had a crush on me
for years.

225
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:21,658
He was the first one
that told me about vampires.

226
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,493
So, what made you
want to be one?

227
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:26,029
It's a very long list
of reasons, elena,

228
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,898
All of which i'm sure
you've thought about.

229
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,668
That was your first lie.

230
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,571
It's inevitable.
You're gonna get old.

231
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:38,742
Stefan won't.
Forever doesn't last very long

232
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:40,711
When you're human.
I'm sorry,

233
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:42,846
But i don't have
what you're looking for.

234
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:45,215
Sit down.

235
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:47,984
And tell your boyfriend
to walk away.

236
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,761
I want the invention.

237
00:12:57,762 --> 00:12:59,763
I don't have it.
I know that.

238
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:01,898
But damon does.

239
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:03,900
And you're gonna
get it for me.

240
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:05,936
He's not gonna
give it to me.

241
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:08,538
Then the blood
will be on your hands.

242
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,615
It was nice
meeting you, elena.

243
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:53,817
Hey, anna.
Uh, where are you?

244
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:56,653
What's up? Uh...

245
00:13:56,654 --> 00:13:59,489
Give me a call
when you get this.

246
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,160
How is anna?

247
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:05,495
I like that girl.
She has fire.

248
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,597
Uh, i--I don't know.

249
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,433
She won't return
my calls.

250
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:11,435
Girl trouble?

251
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:13,036
No, no trouble.

252
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:15,071
Anna just owes me
a call. That's it.

253
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:18,275
Is it the girl
that i saw you with
at the founder's pageant?

254
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:20,977
You two are gettin'
pretty hot and heavy, huh?

255
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:23,413
When was the last time
you saw her?

256
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:25,315
Why?

257
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:27,150
I'm just
making conversation.

258
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:29,052
No one else in this house
likes me.

259
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:32,255
At least i can talk to you,
especially if you need someone
to talk to about girls.

260
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:34,758
Ugh. Please.

261
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:42,232
So, seriously,
how well do you know anna?

262
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,267
I know anna
extremely well.

263
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,371
Well, know that you can
talko me about anything.

264
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:50,974
I'm here to answer
any questions that you have.

265
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:53,510
I'll help you
in any way i can.

266
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:54,744
Why?

267
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:57,481
'Cause your dad
would want me to.

268
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,620
I'm, uh, i'm good.

269
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:12,362
[Music playing]
uh-Oh, cherie.

270
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:15,365
You won again.
Hope i'm wearing
my good underwear.

271
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,334
Heh heh.

272
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:19,803
It's just on
blast from the past

273
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:21,471
After another.
No, no, no.

274
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:24,608
cherie.

275
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:31,648
Damon: it's good
to see you, isobel.

276
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,050
I was just having fun with
your naughty little minion.

277
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:37,153
How'd you find me?

278
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:39,222
Searched all
the neighborhood
bank-Owned foreclosures

279
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:40,891
And found
the most expensive one.

280
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:42,859
Oh, i should have known.

281
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,794
You were the one
who taught me that.

282
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:46,796
Mm-Hmm.
What are you really doing here?

283
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:49,566
Well, you caused
quite a stir when
you blew into town.

284
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:53,136
Oh.
So, everyone except for
me you would have hurt.

285
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:55,105
I'm so sorry.

286
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:56,940
Did you bring
the device?

287
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:06,216
What are you doing
with john gilbert?

288
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,084
We dated a few times
when we were young.

289
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:10,287
He was a little bit
in love with me.

290
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:12,055
I'm sure one of the many.

291
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:14,558
You know,
this little invention,
what do you want with it?

292
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,760
Oh, me personally?

293
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:20,063
I don't want anything with it.
I'm just doing what i'm told.

294
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,432
You know, damon,
we're on the same si..

295
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,801
[Scoffs] oh, yeah?
Which side is that?

296
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:26,536
Katherine's.

297
00:16:26,537 --> 00:16:29,205
She wants john gilbert
to have the device.

298
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:31,841
And i think that you know
that she's not happy

299
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:34,177
When she doesn't get
what she wants.

300
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:36,079
Why are you doing
her dirty work?

301
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,514
Don't kill the messenger.

302
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:40,350
We both know that you can't
control katherine.

303
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:42,852
She does what she wants.
[Scoffs] so do i.

304
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:45,522
Oh, really, damon? You do?

305
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:51,061
What should we do now?

306
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,268
Oh, yeah.

307
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:00,270
Resurface.

308
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:14,017
Now that i have
your attention, listen up.

309
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:16,820
You do not come into my town,
threaten people i care about.

310
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:19,055
Going after elena--
Bad move.

311
00:17:19,056 --> 00:17:21,391
You leave her alone,
or i will rip you to bits,

312
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:23,827
Because i do believe
in killing the messenger.

313
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,729
[Whispering]
you know why?

314
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,631
Because it sends a message.

315
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,435
Katherine wants something
from me,

316
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:34,571
You tell that little bitch
to come get it herself.

317
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:54,993
Hi.

318
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:57,529
Hey.

319
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,165
I couldn't sleep
last night.

320
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,501
You were
obviously upset
about something,

321
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,536
And i just
walked away.

322
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:06,505
That's not me.

323
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:09,675
That can't be us.

324
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:12,845
You're my friend,
elena.

325
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:15,414
If you need me,
i'm here for you.

326
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:18,283
And i'm sorry
i couldn't show you
that yesterday.

327
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:25,457
I met my birth mother.

328
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:29,294
Oh.

329
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:32,064
Was it...

330
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:33,132
Are you ok?

331
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:45,144
Uhh!

332
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:50,249
Hey, man.

333
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,316
Yeah?

334
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:53,986
So, caroline
tells me

335
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:56,522
You've been
on your own
the past 2 weeks.

336
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,190
Is everything ok?

337
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:01,360
You're asking me
about my mom. Seriously?

338
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:04,196
Look, man, why don't i just
have her give you a call when
she walks back through town?

339
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:05,697
Dude...

340
00:19:05,698 --> 00:19:07,599
That's not
what i meant.

341
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,036
Ok? I'm just
trying to...

342
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:12,771
I don't know
what to say.

343
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:14,573
Well, good, man.
Don't say anything,

344
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:16,642
'Cause you're a dick.
End of story.

345
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:18,944
I know...

346
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,213
Whatever.

347
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:29,922
Bonnie: thanks for
meeting me.

348
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:31,757
I wanted you
to see this.

349
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:33,559
Is that emily's
spell book?

350
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,527
I've been going through it
since grams died.

351
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:38,197
Check this out.

352
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:43,702
That's the vampire compass.
Yeah.

353
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:45,637
According to emily,
johnathan gilbert

354
00:19:45,638 --> 00:19:47,906
Never actually
succeeded in
inventing anything.

355
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:51,043
Emily secretly
spelled them all
with magic--

356
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:52,444
Compass...

357
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,781
Rings...

358
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:01,053
And the mystery device
you told me about.

359
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:03,121
Yeah, that's it--

360
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:05,991
Well, part of it.
Damon only has the one piece.

361
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:08,994
Emily pledged
her loyalty to katherine.

362
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:12,764
But she couldn't stand by
and watch innocent people
get killed.

363
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:15,100
This was the only way
she could think of
to help--

364
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:18,904
To let johnathan gilbert
believe he'd actually
invented these devices.

365
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,572
Does it say what it does?

366
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:30,716
Are you sure this is
what isobel wants?

367
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:32,384
Yeah, i'm sure. Why?

368
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:36,355
This is a weapon...

369
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:38,824
Against vampires.

370
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,601
Elena!

371
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:51,937
Hey. Um...
have you seen stefan?

372
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:53,438
I need to find him.

373
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:56,041
No, not lately. Listen.
Um, you have a second?

374
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:58,410
Uh, yeah. What's up?
What's going on?

375
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:01,313
Well, it's anna.
I left her
all these messages,

376
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:03,916
And she hasn't
gotten back to me--
Not even a text.

377
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,484
Anna?

378
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:07,953
I didn't know that you guys
were still friends.

379
00:21:07,954 --> 00:21:09,588
We're more than friends.

380
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:11,924
Look, something could be
seriously wrong.

381
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:14,293
And if you know anything,
you gotta tell me.

382
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,562
I haven't talked
to her, jer.

383
00:21:17,563 --> 00:21:19,464
Are you lying to me
right now?

384
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:21,300
Why would you say that?

385
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:24,369
'Cause that's what
you do, elena. You lie.
You lie about everything.

386
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,338
I know what anna is.

387
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,273
And i know
that you know.

388
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:29,741
So, tell me.

389
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:31,843
Do you have any idea
where she is?

390
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,781
No.

391
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,186
But jer...

392
00:21:41,187 --> 00:21:43,121
Jeremy. Wait.

393
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:44,423
Jeremy!

394
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,627
Isobel.

395
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:52,364
What are you doing here?
I'm your mother, elena.

396
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:55,033
I want to be
more involved in your life.

397
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:58,904
I don't want you in my life.
I understand that.

398
00:21:58,905 --> 00:22:01,206
You already have
a lot of people
that you care about.

399
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:02,674
But i've been studying.

400
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:05,010
Let's see if i got this right.

401
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:08,947
There is the witchy
st friend bonnie.

402
00:22:08,948 --> 00:22:11,750
Gonna stay away
from that one.

403
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:12,918
Oh...

404
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:15,387
Sad little brother jeremy.

405
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:17,889
And there's caroline--

406
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,791
Obnoxious caroline.

407
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,827
I got all of my info
from her, by the way.

408
00:22:21,828 --> 00:22:25,197
She had no idea
who i was, and she
wouldn't stop yapping.

409
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:27,532
Oh.

410
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,267
There's matt--

411
00:22:29,268 --> 00:22:32,771
Friend, ex,
yappy's future ex.

412
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:35,273
Lots of connections there.
Matt's not involved with us.

413
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:37,209
He's involved with you.
Isn't he?

414
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,378
Look, you shouldn't
be here.

415
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,380
You need to leave.
No.

416
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,982
I have some friends
here, too. Look.

417
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:47,252
See that man over there
standing next to matt
by the float?

418
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:50,722
His name's frank.
He's very handsome.

419
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:52,524
And he's also very handy.

420
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:55,060
And he noticed that the axle
was kind of rusted,

421
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:58,163
Which is very dangerous.
So, all you have to do

422
00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:00,999
Is apply a little bit
of pressure, and--

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,401
No!

424
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:04,770
Aah! Uhh!

425
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,239
Boy: hey, get this trailer up!
Come on, guys,
lift it up, please!

426
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,607
Give me a hand!

427
00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:10,709
Uhh! Aah!
Come on, lift.

428
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,745
Oh!
Come on!

429
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:15,547
Aah!

430
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,251
Call for help.

431
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,752
Caroline: ok.

432
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:22,954
Why are you doing this?
I'm showing you how easy it is

433
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:24,956
To hurt the people
that you care about.

434
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:26,291
You're doing this
just because of

435
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:27,626
Johnathan gilbert's
invention?

436
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,361
Hand it over
and the fun will stop.

437
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:31,196
I told you, damon's not
gonna give it to me.

438
00:23:31,197 --> 00:23:34,266
And i think that you
underestimate how much
damon cares about you.

439
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:36,334
He'll kill you
before he gives it up.

440
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:38,637
Is that before or after
i kill your brother jeremy?

441
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,774
Elena: jeremy?

442
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:44,242
Jeremy!

443
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,553
The ambulance is saying
15-20 minutes.

444
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,021
I have my car. I can take him
to the hospital.

445
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:54,090
Caroline can take me.
I didn't drive.

446
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:55,591
Then i'll wait.
It's fine.

447
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,593
You will not wait!
Ok, you need
to see a doctor.

448
00:23:57,594 --> 00:23:59,762
Tyler's driving.
End of story.

449
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:03,099
Go!
I'll bring my car around.

450
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,442
I see you're packing.
That's a good sign.

451
00:24:12,443 --> 00:24:14,410
Won't be long now.

452
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,379
Did you get the missing piece?
Where is it?

453
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,147
I don't have it yet.

454
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:20,316
Then why did you
call me here?

455
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:22,819
'Cause i have
the next best thing.

456
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:30,159
What the hell are you doing?
Getting what i want.

457
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,161
Yeah, but he's my nephew.

458
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:34,697
And you're gonna let him go
right this second.

459
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:36,866
The gaudy ring
on your finger--

460
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:39,202
It comes off.
Come on.

461
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:41,370
Come on, isobel.
I--I know you.

462
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:42,972
Ok?

463
00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:45,374
It's me, john.
You can't hurt a kid.

464
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,144
I'll kill him
to prove you wrong.
Really?

465
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:50,213
Are you that far gone?

466
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:52,348
Look, i know you've changed.

467
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,885
Ok? But the old isobel
is in there somewhere still.

468
00:24:55,886 --> 00:24:57,353
Isn't she?

469
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:00,857
Come on. Let him go.

470
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:01,958
Ok.

471
00:25:18,742 --> 00:25:20,209
Ok.

472
00:25:22,746 --> 00:25:24,881
Isobel: nice try.

473
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:27,984
We'll see how you do
without this.

474
00:25:36,593 --> 00:25:38,127
Where's the device?

475
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:39,462
Damon has it.

476
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:41,464
He's gonna be difficult
to reason with.

477
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:44,000
Then we'll--We'll
go go him.
I'll talk to him.

478
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,303
He's not just gonna
hand it ov, , pecially if
it's harmful to vampires.

479
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:52,074
What if it's not?

480
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,580
Damon: absolutely not.

481
00:25:57,581 --> 00:25:59,916
Just hear me out.
I'm not gonna give the device

482
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:02,185
To isobel so she can give it
to john who's gonna
turn around and kill me.

483
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,187
I like being
a living dead person.

484
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,088
But it'll be useless.
Bonnie can take
its power away.

485
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:07,356
I don't trust her.

486
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,525
I can remove
the original spell.

487
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,461
John and isobel
will never know.
No.

488
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:14,831
No, i'll get jeremy my own way.
Mm-Hmm.
Stefan: really?

489
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:16,499
How are you gonna
do that? H?

490
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,034
Because isobel
is a vampire,

491
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,736
And jeremy can be dead
the second you
walk in the door.

492
00:26:22,105 --> 00:26:24,907
Are you even up for this?
I mean, no offense.

493
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:28,177
You're no emily bennett.
Emily knew what she was doing.

494
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:30,513
I've been practicing.
It's not piano lessons, honey.

495
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:34,283
What's your
favorite book?

496
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:36,085
What?
Name a book,

497
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:37,386
Any book.

498
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,922
Name a book.

499
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:41,757
How about...

500
00:26:41,758 --> 00:26:44,427
"Call of the wild,"
jack london?

501
00:26:54,137 --> 00:26:55,438
Jack london.

502
00:26:57,341 --> 00:26:58,808
Great parlor trick.

503
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:00,176
Elena:
we're doing this, damon.

504
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:02,178
And we're gonna do it
my way.

505
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:04,280
Now, give me the device.

506
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:06,082
We're wasting time.

507
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:09,986
I don't trust you.
I tried to kill you.

508
00:27:09,987 --> 00:27:12,889
Hmm. You're right.
You can't trust me.

509
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,757
But you can trust me.

510
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:33,809
Thank you.

511
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,781
Here you go.

512
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:46,449
Thank you.

513
00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:49,619
What is she after?

514
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,292
Your ancestor
invented a weapon--

515
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:59,195
A device that's extremely
harmful to vampires.

516
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:02,465
We've been trying to get it.
Why?

517
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:06,169
'Cause there's a group of
vampires from a long time ago

518
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,071
That wants revenge
on this town.

519
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:12,208
But why--

520
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:15,111
Why would a vampire
help you kill
other vampires?

521
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:18,047
She has her own reasons
for wanting them dead.

522
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,782
Look, jeremy,

523
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,552
No one ever thought
vampires would return
to this town--

524
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:24,487
Not in modern times.

525
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:26,355
But they have.

526
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,658
And we have to destroy them.
All of them?

527
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:31,694
No--There are some
good ones out there.

528
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:33,596
There's no such thing.

529
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:36,499
I don't believe that.

530
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,568
Well, your dad did.

531
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:41,537
And as his son, that should
mean something to you.

532
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,841
How did my father
know about all this?

533
00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:48,377
Who do you think taught me
about the family history?

534
00:29:27,784 --> 00:29:29,719
Done.

535
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:34,123
Damon: great.

536
00:29:34,124 --> 00:29:36,225
Now what?
Now we give it
to isobel.

537
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:47,303
[Bell ringing]

538
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,755
Where's the device?

539
00:30:05,756 --> 00:30:06,889
Where's my brother?

540
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,524
This isn't
a negotiation.

541
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:10,793
Where's
the invention?

542
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:12,328
Where is my brother?

543
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:14,797
Do you really think
that i came alone?

544
00:30:17,768 --> 00:30:20,636
Do you really think
that i came alone?

545
00:30:26,777 --> 00:30:29,545
For god sakes,
call home.

546
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:30,846
What?

547
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:34,383
Call home, ask to speak
to your brother jeremy.

548
00:30:39,623 --> 00:30:41,123
Hello?

549
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:43,859
Jeremy. Are you ok?

550
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:46,262
Yeah, yeah, i'm fine.

551
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,598
Uncle john, uh,
hit his head.

552
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,099
It was an accident.

553
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,501
And we're all laughing.
[Chuckles]

554
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:55,237
Yeah, but, um,
i'm ok.

555
00:30:55,238 --> 00:30:56,772
I'll be home soon,
all right?

556
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,474
Yeah.

557
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,553
You were never
going to hurt him.

558
00:31:10,554 --> 00:31:13,823
No. I was going
to kill him.

559
00:31:13,824 --> 00:31:16,959
Don't look
for any redeeming
qualities in me.

560
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,195
I don't have any.

561
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:20,997
But you took
a risk with damon.

562
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:23,065
How did you know
that he was going
to give it to me?

563
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:24,634
'Cause he's
in love with you.

564
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:40,483
Thank you.

565
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,451
For what?

566
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:46,322
For being such
a monumental disappointment.

567
00:31:47,858 --> 00:31:51,494
It keeps the memory
of my real mother
perfectly intact.

568
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:53,062
Good-Bye, elena.

569
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:57,967
As long as you have
a salvatore on each arm,

570
00:31:57,968 --> 00:32:01,303
You're doomed.

571
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:03,973
Katherine was smart.

572
00:32:03,974 --> 00:32:06,575
She got out.

573
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:09,078
But we all know that
you're not katherine.

574
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:29,699
Sorry.

575
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:52,250
Hey, it's anna.
Leave a message.

576
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:57,755
Jeremy, we have
to talk about this.

577
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:00,024
No, we really don't.

578
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,826
I don't know
what anna told you,

579
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:04,729
But there are things
that you need to know.

580
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,430
Yeah?

581
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,865
Because...

582
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:10,401
I'm pretty sure
that your journal
covered it.

583
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:13,204
You read my journal?

584
00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:15,840
And save me
the speech about
invasion of privacy,

585
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:17,942
Because i read
a section about damon
erasing my memory,

586
00:33:17,943 --> 00:33:19,610
About what happened
to vicki.

587
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:22,847
Jeremy, please,
you don't understand.

588
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:25,383
The night that vicki died,

589
00:33:25,384 --> 00:33:28,152
It was like mom and dad
died all over again.

590
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:30,021
It was all over your face.

591
00:33:30,022 --> 00:33:32,623
And it hurt so much
to see you like that.

592
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:33,858
I just wanted
to take away your pain,

593
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:36,294
I'm so sorry.
Just get out.

594
00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:37,628
No, jeremy--

595
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:39,830
Elena!

596
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,199
Just get out.

597
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,968
Please.

598
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,815
Jer, i--

599
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:21,872
What do you want?

600
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:25,142
I totally get it.

601
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:28,012
You here as a history teacher.

602
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:29,847
It's good.

603
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,148
What the hell
are you doing?

604
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:32,383
You act like
you don't care,

605
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:34,485
And yet here you are
hunting me down.

606
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,025
I'm leaving.

607
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:42,893
I just thought
i'd say good-Bye.

608
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,595
Well, you couldn't be
bothered the first time,

609
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:46,864
So why now?

610
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:48,399
You hate me, good.

611
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,568
Does that make it
easier for you?

612
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:52,036
I mean, what is
the whole point
of this exercise?

613
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:53,604
What did you expect?

614
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,406
You spent alalalisyingngngngngn,

615
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:56,874
What did you think
you would find?

616
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,910
The woman
who gave me this...

617
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:01,278
I mean, you act
like you don't care.

618
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,114
But you cared enough
to protect me
after you left.

619
00:35:03,115 --> 00:35:06,484
I was a different person
back then.

620
00:35:06,485 --> 00:35:07,652
Coffs] right,
right, right.

621
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:09,286
And that person is gone.

622
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:12,723
The woman i married,
the woman i loved,
she's just--She's gone.

623
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:17,094
You expect me
to believe that?

624
00:35:22,234 --> 00:35:24,268
What are you doing?

625
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:25,369
Well, i'm ring-Free.

626
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,837
I'm vervain-Free,

627
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:29,173
So either kill me
or compel me,

628
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:31,208
Because...

629
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,411
I don't believe it.

630
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:37,481
Not for a second.

631
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,285
[Grunts]
i wanted this.

632
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:43,854
I needed this.

633
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,794
And i'm going
to regret it forever.

634
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:55,499
This was my mistake.

635
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,102
Not yours.

636
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:05,810
You are not going
to remember this.

637
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,845
When you think
of our marriage,

638
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:09,413
You are going to have
such fond

639
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:12,183
And beautiful memories.

640
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:13,751
But that's in the past now,

641
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:16,353
And your heart's
free of me.

642
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:19,256
It's better this way.

643
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:23,394
Good-Bye, rick.

644
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,835
Anna? Hey,
what are you doing here?

645
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:08,105
My mother.

646
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,742
She's dead.

647
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:13,544
What?

648
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:18,149
She was killed.

649
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,151
Oh, my god, anna...

650
00:37:20,152 --> 00:37:22,086
Hey.

651
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:23,988
Hey, i'm so sorry.

652
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:27,124
I know i'm not supposed
to be here,

653
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,760
But i don't have
anywhere else to go.

654
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:35,533
Hey, it's ok.

655
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,776
Would you like one?

656
00:37:45,777 --> 00:37:47,444
Ahem.

657
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:49,380
Say it.

658
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:52,683
Whatever it is,
purge, get it out.

659
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:56,120
It's about what isobel said.

660
00:37:56,121 --> 00:37:57,121
What about it?

661
00:37:57,122 --> 00:37:59,957
Well, i know that
you and elena bonded,

662
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:02,259
And i know that
she cares about you, and, uh,

663
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,928
I know you care about her.

664
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:06,964
Well, this is going
in an interesting
direction.

665
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:10,568
I'm just concerned
about elena being hurt.

666
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:12,169
She considers you a friend.

667
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,005
Same here. Elena's
a very good friend.

668
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:18,542
Actually,
she might qualify
as my only friend.

669
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:20,411
Is that a problem?

670
00:38:20,412 --> 00:38:23,480
So, at the risk
of sounding like a, um,

671
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:25,416
Like a jealous boyfriend--

672
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:26,951
Oh, there's no risk.

673
00:38:26,952 --> 00:38:28,152
You do.

674
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:30,654
History will not be
repeating itself

675
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:32,923
Where elena's concerned.

676
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,126
Do you understand
what i'm saying?

677
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:39,129
Sure.

678
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,002
Do you...
understand?

679
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:47,504
Hey, whatever you say, man.

680
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:49,473
I mean, honestly,
we're just friends.

681
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:50,941
And as her friend,
i wasn't looking forward

682
00:38:50,942 --> 00:38:52,476
To telling her
the truth, anyway.

683
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:54,545
So, i'll let you do it.

684
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:57,481
What truth?

685
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,316
About john.

686
00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:01,886
'Cause i know you guys
don't like to keep
secrets from each other.

687
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:03,187
What are you
talking about?

688
00:39:03,188 --> 00:39:04,555
Am i the only one
around here

689
00:39:04,556 --> 00:39:06,390
Who has the ability
to put two and two together?

690
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,826
Isobel. Hello?

691
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:13,130
She dated john
when she was 15.

692
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:15,199
She gets pregnant,
and ends up

693
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,201
At the doctor's office
of john's brother.

694
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:19,136
Now, what do you think
is john's role is
in all of this, huh?

695
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:20,271
I mean, go ahead,
think about it.

696
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:23,140
I'll wait. You get it?
You there yet? Hmm?

697
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:26,310
So, you think
that john

698
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:28,545
Is elena's father?

699
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:29,580
Ding ding ding!
[Scoffs]

700
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:31,849
What proof
do you have?

701
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,851
I don't need any proof.
I have the dna tests

702
00:39:33,852 --> 00:39:35,653
For john, elena,
and [indistinct].

703
00:39:35,654 --> 00:39:39,757
But i know how well
you deal with these
big bombshells, so...

704
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:41,892
Sleep tight.

705
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:44,395
Oh, and when you do
tell elena,

706
00:39:44,396 --> 00:39:47,164
And she needs a friend
to talk to about anything...

707
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,134
I'm here for her.

708
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:04,481
Hello?

709
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:05,683
On your doorstep,

710
00:40:05,684 --> 00:40:07,651
You'll find what
you've been looking for.

711
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:08,752
And my ring?

712
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:11,255
Don't screw this up.

713
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:20,831
I got it.

714
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,333
I won't fail.

715
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:23,934
You better not.

716
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:25,502
Katherine wants

717
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:27,638
All of those
tomb vampires dead.

718
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:30,507
And i want to add
two more to that list.

719
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,344
Let me guess.

720
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:35,446
Stefan and damon.

721
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,147
I don't want
this life for her.

722
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:38,749
Well, it was always
a part of the plan.

723
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,551
Consider them gone.

724
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:43,253
She's our daughter, john.

725
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:45,489
We owe that to her.

726
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:48,192
I know.

727
00:40:57,502 --> 00:41:00,070
So you're not going
to tell me what happened?

728
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,245
I did something bad,
caroline.

729
00:41:08,246 --> 00:41:11,081
And i lied about it.

730
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:14,151
To who?

731
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:17,021
To elena.

732
00:41:17,022 --> 00:41:19,690
I pretended
to do something

733
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:22,426
I didn't really do.

734
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:25,062
What are you talking about?

735
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:28,899
I couldn't do what
she wanted me to do.

736
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,267
It wasn't right.

737
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:31,802
Grams would have
never done it,

738
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:34,838
So i couldn't,
either.

739
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:37,841
But when elena
finds out...

740
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:41,412
She's never going
to forgive me.

Woman: Previously on
"the vampire diaries"...

2
00:00:02,657 --> 00:00:04,553
Stefan: For over a century,
I have lived in secret

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,413
Until now.
I know the risk.

4
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:07,634
But I have to know her.

5
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:09,460
Elena--she's a dead ringer
for katherine.

6
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:11,695
I want the invention.
Don't have it.

7
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:14,232
But damon does.
And yore gonna
get it for me.

8
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:15,799
I'm not gonna
give the device to isobel

9
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:18,002
So she can give it
to john who's gonna
turn around and kill me.

10
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,604
But it'll be useless
bonnie can take
the spell off.

11
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,476
You took
a risk with damon.

12
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:27,977
How did you know
that he was going
to give it to me?

13
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:29,946
'causee's
in love with you.

14
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:34,984
I couldn't do what
she wanted me to do.

15
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:36,453
It wasn't right.

16
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,256
But when elena
finds out...

17
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:42,158
She's never going
to forgive me.

18
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:15,189
Ow. This dress hurts.

19
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:17,791
Humph.
Suck it in, baby.

20
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:21,128
[music playing]

21
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:23,564
[indistinct chattering]

22
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:29,168
Mrs. Lockwood:
No, no, no, no.

23
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:30,769
This lineup
is all wrong.

24
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:33,506
The marching band
should be in front of
the historicalociety.

25
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:35,174
Matt, time to get
on your float.

26
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:39,145
Boys, I asked you
to put the chair
on the founder's float.

27
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:41,981
Ladies, time to get
on your float.

28
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,350
Look at you,
all retro.

29
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:46,951
What are you
doing here?

30
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,987
Why wouldn't I be here?

31
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,788
Bonnie deactivated
the gilbert inventn.

32
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:54,593
Isobel's gone. Heh.
And it's founder's day.

33
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,730
I'm here to eat cotton candy
and steal your girl.

34
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,465
Don't start with me, damon.
Oh, you started it, stefan,

35
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:04,301
With that whole "I'm insecure,
leave ena alone" speech.

36
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,570
I'm just enjoying that.

37
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:08,405
As long as you heard it.

38
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:10,007
Huh? What?

39
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,708
[chuckles]

40
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,710
You have
noense of humor, stefan.

41
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:17,313
Actually, I just
have no see of
damon humor.

42
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:19,449
Damon humor--
hey, look.

43
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:20,850
I get it. I get it.

44
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,785
I'm the better, hotter,
superior choice,

45
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:25,054
And you're scared now that
katherine's out of the picture

46
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:27,290
That I'm gonna turn
all my attention to elena.

47
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:30,360
But don't worry.
Elena is not katherine.

48
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:33,228
You're right.
She's not.

49
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:14,169
Anna.

50
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:18,674
Look at you.

51
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:21,075
Heh. I know,
it's stupid, huh?

52
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:23,977
I'm part of
e parade.
But how are you?

53
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:26,046
I've been--I've been
so worried,

54
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:28,382
And I feel awful.

55
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,950
Why?

56
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:33,387
You didn't kill my mother.
Your uncle did.

57
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,556
Are you sure
it was him?

58
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:37,524
Who else
would have done it?

59
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:41,895
He doesn't
understand, anna.
It's who he is.

60
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:43,797
He hates
all vampires.

61
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:46,366
He's just doing
what he thinks is right.

62
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,301
Are you defending him?

63
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:51,105
No. No way.

64
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:52,671
It's just--

65
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,208
I do understand
where he's coming from.

66
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,309
He's convinced
all the tomb vampis

67
00:03:57,377 --> 00:04:00,880
Want revenge
on this town,
and he's just...

68
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,882
He's trying
to protect it.

69
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,218
They do want revenge.

70
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:07,120
Or, at least, they did.

71
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:10,088
But that's why
we separated from them.

72
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:14,392
My mom wasn't after venge.
She just wanted her life back.

73
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:18,630
I haveo get out
of this town, jeremy.

74
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:20,698
You're leaving?

75
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:24,034
But I've been thinking.
You could come with me.

76
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:26,871
I could turn you.
I mean, you said
you wanted me to.

77
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:29,073
Here.

78
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,108
It's my blood.

79
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:33,844
If you die with it
in your system,
you'll come back.

80
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,149
Anna--
I know you,

81
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,949
What it's like for you--

82
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:42,852
Being alone,
always feeling empty inside,

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,821
No one to understand.

84
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:48,391
But when youe a vampire,
you don't have to feel that way.

85
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,559
You can shut it off.

86
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,295
I can show you how.

87
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:59,067
I wanted to. I did.

88
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,708
But I don't think
I ca

89
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:09,011
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:16,650
John?

91
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:18,686
Is--is that even posble?

92
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:22,323
Well, there's no proof,
but he dated isobel
when she was a teenager,

93
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,326
And he was the one who
brought her to your dad's
office for the delivery.

94
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,994
My who life,
I've never liked this man.

95
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,362
I...

96
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,531
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just--

97
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,433
I wanted to te you
before damon dropped
it on you

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,135
In some typically
inappropriate way.

99
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:38,104
No, I'm happy
that you told me. I just...

100
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,241
I really hope
that it's not true.

101
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:45,410
What am I supposed to do?
Do I just...

102
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,281
Confront him and say,
"are you mbiological father?"

103
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,051
I guess
when you're ready.

104
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,486
I'm never gonna be ready.

105
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,224
Stefan, I have enough problems
with the family that
I actually care about.

106
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,492
Jeremy hates me,
and why wouldn't he?

107
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,728
My journal gave him
every single reason to.

108
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:05,663
He's just hu.
He's confused.

109
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,798
He's never gonna
forgivme for vicki,

110
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,901
For taking away his memory,
for lying to him.

111
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,737
He's your brother.
He'll forgive you.

112
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,973
Just give him some time.

113
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,574
Bonnie: Say cheese.
Wait. Hide your cast.

114
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:20,443
It's not era-appropriate.
Seriously? Uhh.

115
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,812
Yes. [giggles]
ok. All right.

116
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,416
[shutter clicks]
I want one with bonnie now.

117
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:27,885
Here, I can take it.

118
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:32,288
I'll be on the float.

119
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:33,622
Uhh.

120
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,624
I said I was sorry.

121
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:38,827
You made out with his mother,
and then you beat him to a pulp.

122
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:42,331
You're gonna have to do
a little bit better than sorry.

123
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:45,501
Elena: Jeremy.

124
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:47,736
Heh. I was wondering
where you were.

125
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:49,237
You look great.

126
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:51,072
You guys did
a really great job
on the float.

127
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,041
Go away, elena.
Jeremy, come on, please.

128
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:55,476
I don't want it to be
like this between us.

129
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:57,712
Why don't you have damon
erase my memory again?

130
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,548
Then I can go back to
being your in-the-dark
little brother.

131
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:02,284
Jer, please.

132
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:04,919
Just don't.

133
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:06,320
You n't fix this
that easily.

134
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:10,057
Something like this
doesn't just get fixed.

135
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,698
[crowd cheering]
let's give a big hand

136
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:22,068
To the mystic falls
high school marching ban

137
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:25,571
[band playing]

138
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:34,113
Mrs. Lockwood:
And for a little local history,

139
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:36,614
Mr. Saltzman's students
have recreated

140
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:39,384
Virginia's
battle of willow creek.

141
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,125
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

142
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:50,128
Our stunning
miss mystic falls court

143
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:52,296
And their handsome escorts.

144
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:55,199
[cheering intensifies]

145
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:04,408
This is caroline forbes,
miss mystic falls.

146
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:08,078
Mrs. Lockwood:
Aren't they beautiful?

147
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:28,563
What do you want?

148
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,532
Just watching
the parade.

149
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,302
Where are you going?
Away from you.

150
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,769
I want to say
something to you.

151
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:37,272
Just leave me alone.
Thank you.

152
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,574
The device
that emily spelled
could have killed me.

153
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:43,744
I don't take whayou did
lightly, so...

154
00:08:43,812 --> 00:08:45,480
Thank you.

155
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:49,317
I did it for elena.
I know that.

156
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:51,386
But I'm still
very grateful.

157
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:53,454
And...

158
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:55,689
I owe you.

159
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:01,594
Enjoy the parade.

160
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:09,403
Mrs. Lockwood: Let's hear it
for the stic falls
high school football team.

161
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,938
All rit! Let's show them
our support, everybody.

162
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,947
This is the key.

163
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,017
Once inserted,
the device will be activated.

164
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:28,087
It will work only once
for an estimated time
of 5 minutes.

165
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:29,688
Mayor lockwood:
Yes. How does it work?

166
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:32,357
It's a high-pitched frequency
that humans can't he..

167
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,627
Any vampire
within a 5-block radius
will be incapacitated,

168
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:37,195
Exposing them.

169
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:39,229
At that time,
the sheriff's v5 depies

170
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:41,165
Will inject them with vervain
and bring themere,

171
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,667
Where we'll finish them off.

172
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:44,569
And you're certain
they're attacking tonight?

173
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,071
I had a source.
One of the vampires
from the tomb--

174
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:48,573
He confirmed the attack.

175
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,075
Man: Everybody listen up.

176
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:53,210
The plan stays the same.

177
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:55,045
We wait
till the fireworks start.

178
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:57,080
Ununtil then, blend in.

179
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:59,115
Stay a part
of the celebration.

180
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,817
They'll never see us coming.

181
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:04,420
They want revenge for what
our ancestors did in 1864,

182
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:06,155
Which makes us their targets.

183
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:08,024
This area here is the stage.

184
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:10,659
This is where
the founding famies
are gonna be.

185
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,462
Any questions?

186
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,497
We're taking
an enormous risk.

187
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:18,166
We're talking about
our families, john.

188
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,038
Anna.

189
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:25,307
What are you
doing here?

190
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,043
It's the only way
to draw them out
and kill them...

191
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,112
All of them.

192
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,033
I like you better
like this.

193
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:50,102
The period look, it...

194
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:52,369
Didn't suit you.

195
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:54,706
Is that an insult?

196
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:57,308
Actually, elena,
is a compliment

197
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,376
Of the highest order.

198
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:04,348
Look, I know
stefan is worried

199
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,484
About our friendship.

200
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:08,318
Did he mention
something to you, too?

201
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:10,687
No.Idid he mention
something to you?

202
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:13,323
No. Nothing worth repeating.

203
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,959
So, I think
you should stop with
the flirty little comments

204
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:17,794
And that eye thing
that you do.

205
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:19,863
What eye thing?

206
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:23,532
Heh.

207
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,702
Don't make me regret
being your friend.

208
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,805
Ok?

209
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,785
I don't believe
that we can't fix this.

210
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:46,287
I lied. I was wrong.

211
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,790
But you're my brother,
jer, and I love you.

212
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,725
And I have to fix it.

213
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,227
So, just tell me.
What can I do?

214
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:58,699
You can go to hell, elena.

215
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,934
[music playing]

216
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:19,052
Damon, mockingly:
I have so many emotions,

217
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,453
But I don't have any way
to express them.

218
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,556
Being a teenager is so hard.
You dick.

219
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,725
You do not
talk to me like that.
I'm not your sister.

220
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:27,993
And from now on,
don't talk to your sister
that way, either.

221
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,662
So, what, you're gonna
kill me just 'cause
I hurt ele's's feelings?

222
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,731
Cut her some slack.

223
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,733
She erased my memories.

224
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,267
No, I did.

225
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,171
She was protectingou.

226
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:42,240
It wasn't
her call to make.

227
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,508
[panting]

228
00:12:44,576 --> 00:12:47,578
Let go of me
before I cau a scene.

229
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,814
You'll be unconscious
before you even
got a word out.

230
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,215
Let him go.

231
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:55,219
You all right?

232
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:57,021
Yeah.

233
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,089
What my brother
is trying to say

234
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:01,424
Ison't blame elena
for this.

235
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:04,160
Damon turned vicki.

236
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:06,863
I killed her.

237
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:10,934
She was a threat to you,
and she was a threat
to your sister.

238
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:15,938
I'm sorry that it happened.
I wish that it hadn't.

239
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:20,508
Shouldn't have
made me forget.

240
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:24,479
Good cop, bad cop--
I like it.

241
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:26,915
What are you doing? Hmm?
He was being a punk.

242
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:29,317
Elena's relationship
with her brother is
none of your business.

243
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:31,052
You stay out of it.
Oh, the's only one

244
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,055
Do-gooder hero role available.
Oh, my bad. I'm sorry.

245
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:35,489
Get over yourself.

246
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:37,725
We both know that
you're not doing this
for e right reasons.

247
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:40,862
See, there you go with
th little jealousy act again.

248
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,164
Uh, wh-what are
the right reasons, stefan?

249
00:13:43,232 --> 00:13:44,966
Enlighten me. Please.
Well, see, damon,

250
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,868
It's only real when
it comes from your desire

251
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:50,571
To do the right thing
for nothing in return.

252
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,573
Right. Yeah.
And I know that that is

253
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,475
An entirely
foreign concept to you.

254
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,211
I completely understand
how you wouldn't get it.

255
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,383
You wa to use
our town as bait?

256
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,151
It's too dangerous.
It's insane.

257
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:07,253
Wee e gone over the plans
with your deputies.

258
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:09,088
They're all on board.

259
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:10,456
You've gone
behind me?

260
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:12,858
Yeah, because wenew that's
exactly how you'd react.

261
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:15,161
Our children are here.
Liz, we need to do this.

262
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:18,063
We have no choice.
This is the reason
for the secret council.

263
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:22,867
Our founding fathers
created the secret council
for just this rpose.

264
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:31,209
I'm the sheriff.
It's my call.

265
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:33,412
And I say no.

266
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:36,914
Richard, let me speak
to the sheriff alone.

267
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:44,488
John, you're not
thinking clearly.

268
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:46,791
I'm not gonna
change my mind abouthis.

269
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,673
Yorerellllroround?

270
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:18,346
Hehere's setetng

272
00:15:22,283 --> 00:15:24,084
How do you know this?
I went to them.

273
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:26,953
They think
I'm m th them, but I'm not.

274
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:29,789
They want
the founding families dead.

275
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,992
When is this
supposed to happen?

276
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,595
When the fireworks start.

277
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:40,199
John gilrt wants to use
that invention o othem.

278
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,700
Waitit
thenene can't bebeere.

279
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:43,635
It doesn't work.
It's been deactivated.

280
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:45,504
Well, then a lot
of people are nna die.

281
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,606
Where are they right now?

282
00:15:47,674 --> 00:15:50,009
They're already here,
dan.

283
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:54,914
Remember, we don't know
which of them
ingest vervain.

284
00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:56,849
It's not about the feed.

285
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,950
It's about the kill.

286
00:15:59,018 --> 00:16:01,186
You know what to do.

287
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:11,562
Rick.
Yeah.

288
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,563
You keep those
nifty little
vamp weapons

289
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:15,565
In the car?
Yeah. Why do you ask?

290
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:18,002
Because this square
is crawling with
tomb vampires.

291
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:20,004
I think we might
need a stake or two.

292
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,738
Got it.

293
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:25,575
[chatterg
and laughing]

294
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:29,379
Uh, what are you doing?
Saving your life.

295
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,214
15 words or less--

296
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,849
Tomb vps are here.
Founding families
are the target.

297
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:35,851
Get her out of here. Now.
Wait. Wait.

298
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,153
Where are you going?

299
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,122
That's more than
15 words, stefan.

300
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:41,424
Wait.
Jeremy's out here somewhere.

301
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,193
Let's go find him.
Come on.

302
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:46,361
[music playing]

303
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:51,400
There was this time
freshman year

304
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:53,201
When bonnie and I were
in a fight.

305
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:55,804
And we swore that we would
never talk again.

306
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:58,040
Caroline,
give it a rest.

307
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:02,977
Thanks.

308
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:11,452
What are you doing here?
I told you to goome.

309
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,087
I decided not to.

310
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:15,356
If I tell you
to do something,
you do it.

311
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:17,757
Get off me.
Mayor. Is everything ok?

312
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,098
Please, tyr, I need
you to go home. Now.

313
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,899
Take your friends
with you.

314
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:28,801
But why?
What's going on?

315
00:17:30,271 --> 00:17:32,305
I can't explain.

316
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:34,473
All of you need
to get home. Now.

317
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,808
Please.

318
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:38,810
Yeah, ok.

319
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:41,146
[exhales] here.

320
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:43,648
[keys jingling]
take my car.

321
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:45,951
It's outack.

322
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:48,420
Come on. Caroline, matt,
go with him.

323
00:17:57,997 --> 00:18:00,198
Anna, what are you doing here?
My uncle could s you--

324
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:02,700
I don't care about that.
Needed to find you.

325
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:08,972
For 150 years,

326
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,875
Mystic falls has been
the kind of town

327
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:14,444
That everybody
wants to call home--

328
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:18,515
Safe, osperous, welcoming.

329
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,817
And we have the founders
to thank for that.

330
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:25,921
And that's why I'd like
to dedicate this evening's
fireworks display

331
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:27,856
To their legacy.

332
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:29,925

334
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,842
Enjoy the show!

[fireworks whistling]
[crowd cheering]

336
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,785
Stay clo to me.

337
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:01,021
[cheering continues]

338
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:18,104
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

339
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:30,282
[door opens and closes]

340
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:32,617
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

341
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,819
Yes. As a matter
of fact, I do.

342
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:36,521

345
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:42,359
Aah!

346
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,027
Aah!
Stefan?

347
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:46,130
What's going on?
What's happening?

348
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,031
My head.
What?

349
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,033
My head.

350
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:54,105
Uhh! Aah!

351
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,507
Aah!
What's wrong?

352
00:19:56,575 --> 00:20:00,009
Anna.
[sobbing] please make it stop.

353
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:13,422
[squealing continues]
what the hell is that?

354
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,023
What's the matter?

355
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,259
That noise.
Wait, what noise?

356
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:21,263
Oh.
Whoa.

357
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:23,064
Tyler. Tyler!
Aah!

358
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,900
Aah! Aah! Unh!

00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:41,282
Stefan.
Ow.

365
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:44,385
I got this one.
There's one over there.

366
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,886
Take this. Go. Go. Go!

367
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,024
I don't know what happened.
He jt dropped.

368
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:54,093
He's not the only one.
Cops are grabbing everyone
whs gone down,

369
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:56,763
Injecting them
with vervain.
What?

370
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:01,867
They're rounding up
the vampires.

371
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,536
Please help him.

372
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:13,011
Aah! Uhh! My head!
[sobbing]

373
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,447
Hey, I got one.

374
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:17,915
What a you doing?

375
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:20,117
What a you doing?
Hey! Leave her alone!

00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:21,786
Hey!
[sobbing]

377
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:23,555
What are you doing?
Hey! Leave her alone!

378
00:21:23,622 --> 00:21:26,290
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Anna! Leave her one! Anna!

379
00:21:52,382 --> 00:21:53,783
The device is done.

380
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:56,019
The only thing keeping them down
is the vervain.

381
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,321
We don't have much time.
Let's finish this.

382
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:06,829
Anna.

383
00:22:08,164 --> 00:22:11,200
[liquid sloshing]

384
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:13,367
You can head up.
I'll take it from here.

385
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:18,973
[grunting]

386
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,215
Please.
Uhh.

387
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,684
Uhh.

00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,520
[gasps]

389
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,126
Are you ok?
It's like needles

390
00:23:19,193 --> 00:23:21,193
Were piercing my skull,
and then it just stopped.

391
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:23,129
I saw at least
5 vampires go down.

392
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,430
They were taking them to
your family's old building.

393
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:29,635
It's the gilbert device.
It has to be.

394
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:31,771
But how did he
get it to work?

395
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:33,538
Bonnie unspelled it.

396
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:35,174
Maybe she didn't.

397
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:37,041
She did.
We saw her do it.

398
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:39,443
No, no, no. He's right.
Think about it.

399
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:42,446
We asked bonnie
to deactivate a device

400
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:44,783
That could protect people
against vampires.

401
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,651
So we could
protect you.

402
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,788
And damon. Vampires.

403
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:51,823
Where is damon?

404
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:55,325
I don't know.
I haven't seen him
since this started.

405
00:23:56,761 --> 00:23:58,896
Can you get my broer?
Take him home?

406
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:01,198
Of course.
Let's go.

407
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,433
[door opens]

408
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:06,136
Liz. Are you ok?

409
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:07,771
There's a key in--
what is going on?

410
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,672
There's a key in my belt.
I need you to get it.

411
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,874
Uhh. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

412
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:13,742
Something's happened
to richard.

413
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:15,744
They took him.
Who took him?

414
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:18,314
Your deputies.
I--I don't understand.

415
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:20,449
He's not a vampire.

416
00:24:20,517 --> 00:24:22,084
Let's go.

417
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:26,054
[grunting and groaning]

418
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,425
Mayor.

419
00:24:31,627 --> 00:24:33,995
Ishat you?
What are you doing here?!

420
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:36,264
I'm a vampire.

421
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,467
What's your excuse?

422
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:42,669
No, really.

423
00:24:42,737 --> 00:24:45,272
The vervain
didn't affect you.

424
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,543
You're not a vampire.
What the hell are you?

425
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:53,113

Hey, are you ok?
Your side took
the biggest hit.

429
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:00,453
I'm fine. I'm fine.
No, they need

430
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,655
To check you out.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

431
00:25:02,723 --> 00:25:04,557
They're helping tyler.

What the hell?
What? What's wrong?

435

His eyes.

[inhales and pants]

437
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:29,847
What happened?
Dude, don't scare me like that.

some help over here.

Caroline, hey.
God, what happened?

442
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:39,924
Caroline, wake up.

443
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:43,261
Wait, wait, wait.

444
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:45,128
I can hear them.

445
00:25:45,196 --> 00:25:46,863
The building's
on fire.

446
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:48,932
Elena: What?
Building's on fire.

Where's damon?

With the rest of them,

450
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:05,281
Where he should be.
It's over for damon.

451
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,184
You're crazy.
Why?

452
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:12,454
'cause I'm doing what
shou have been done
145 years ago?

453
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:14,856
This is
the right thing, elena.

454
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:20,395
Go ahead.
You won't make it out.

455
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:22,997
It'll save me the trouble
of killing you myself.

456
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:25,266
You know
the building well.

457
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,568
Is therenother
entrance in?

458
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:30,838

00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,374
Take one more step,
and I'll alert those deputies

461
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:37,911
That they missed a vampire.
I'm asking you not to.

462
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:40,680
That doesn't mean
anything to me.

463
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:44,517
As my father, it should.

464
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:53,092
You know.

465
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,627
I wasn't sure.

466
00:26:55,695 --> 00:26:57,529
But now I am.

467
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:07,072
Boie: Hey!
You can't go in there.

468
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,040
The fire
will take you out.

469
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:12,243
He's my brother, bonnie.

470
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:20,251
Ahh.

00:28:04,327 --> 00:28:07,462
Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

Are they gonna be ok?

[radio chatter]

489
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:55,690
The fire's out.

490
00:28:55,757 --> 00:28:59,660
The story is that
the building's old wiring
is what caused it.

491
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:03,130
Did you see
where damon nt?

492
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:06,100
No, he just
kind of disappeared.

493
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:08,502
Figures. [chuckles]

494
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:10,970
Ohh.

495
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:14,274
I'm so glad you're ok.

[exhales]

497
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:19,646
I try so hard...

498
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:22,315
To hate him.

499
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:25,917
I guess it's just
pointless.

500
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:28,621
You care about him.

501
00:29:30,657 --> 00:29:32,391
So do I.

502
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:37,763
But I love you, stefan.

503
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,066
I know that you're worried
about that.

504
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:45,470
I just...
You know,

505
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,372
I-I know my brother.

506
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:48,906
But I love you, stefan.

507
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:51,743
I know the trouble
he can cause.

508
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:55,480
I love you, stefan. You.

509
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:09,359
You have nothing
to worry about.

510
00:30:10,495 --> 00:30:13,929
Ok?

511
00:30:13,997 --> 00:30:16,899
[exhales] so jenna called.

512
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:19,335
Jeremy's home.

513
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:20,936
I'm just gonna run over
to the school

514
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:22,905
To pick up my dress,
my clothes
the rest of my stuff.

515
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:25,207
And en I'll check on him.

516
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:50,030
What are you doing here?

517
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:52,499
Anna's dead.

518
00:30:53,968 --> 00:30:58,138
I figured that
once they took her away.

519
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,941
I know you cared
about her.

520
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:04,910
Yeah, I did.

521
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:07,347
I saw her killed.

522
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:13,753
I was watching
and all I could
think about was...

523
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:16,689
I wanted to help her.

524
00:31:16,757 --> 00:31:19,190
But I couldn't.

525
00:31:19,258 --> 00:31:22,494
Why are you telling me
all this?

526
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:26,598
I took away
your sfering
once before.

527
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:29,401
I can do it again.

528
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:31,436
But it's your choice.

529
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:33,471
Look...

530
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:36,907
I know you think
you took it away,

531
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:40,143
But it's still there.

532
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:42,713
Even if I can't
remember why,

533
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:45,249
I still feel empty.

534
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:47,217
Alone.

535
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:53,423
And making me forget
won't fix it.

536
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:56,526
It won't fix
what's really wrong.

537
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:06,301
What I did to vicki

538
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:09,037
Was wrong.

539
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:12,674
Sorry for my part.

540
00:32:18,314 --> 00:32:21,516
Anna said that vampires
don't have to feel pain;

541
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:25,219
That they could turn it off
if they shut out their humanity.

542
00:32:26,688 --> 00:32:29,323
That's very true.

543
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:31,426
Is it easier that way?

544
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,361
Is what easier?

545
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,831
[scoffs] life.

546
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:40,133
Life sucks
either way, jeremy.

547
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:43,437
At least
if you're a vampire,

548
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,639
You don't have
to feel bad abouit
if you don't want to.

549
00:32:45,706 --> 00:32:47,674
Is that what you did?

550
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:49,609
I did it for...

551
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:53,012
I did it for
a very long time.

552
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:58,517
And life was
a lot easier.

553
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:07,493
[crickets chirping]

554
00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:11,529
Hey, man.

555
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,032
I'm so sorry.

556
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,435
Look, I don't even know
what happened.

557
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:20,472
It's ok, man.

558
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,040
L right.

559
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:35,586
What's happening?
Is she all right?

560
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:37,988
Oh, there was some
internal bleeding.

561
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:39,189
We're taking her
into surry.

562
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:40,757
What else did they say?

563
00:33:40,825 --> 00:33:41,791
Is she going to be ok?

564
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:44,927
They're going to do
everything they can.

565
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:52,768
Tyler, have you
talked to your mom?

566
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:56,238
I left her message
telling her I was here.

567
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,139
You need to call her.

568
00:33:58,207 --> 00:33:59,941
What is it?

569
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:03,745
It's your dad.

Hey.
You, uh,

573
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,106
You just missed
elena.

574
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:09,774
I was looking for you,
actually.

575
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:11,609
Oh.

576
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:14,411
Elena is my best frien

577
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:16,646
And because she loves you,

578
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,349
I couldn't let you
or damon die in that fire.

579
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,750
I'm very grateful,
bonnie.

580
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,119
I hope you know that.

581
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:25,455
I do. But I hope you know
that tngs have to change.

582
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,491
Damon has to change.

583
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:31,795
We both want
the same thing.

584
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:35,198
We both want to protect
the people we care about.

585
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:37,066
The difference is,
for you,

586
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:38,601
Damon is one of them.

587
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,604
You saw what I was able
to do tonight.

588
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:44,040
I know who I am now.

589
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:48,044
And if damon spills
so much as one drop

590
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:53,115
Of innocent blood,
I'll take him down.

Even if have
to take you with him.

592
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:05,060
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that.

593
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:07,829
Let's hope it doesn't.

594
00:36:21,176 --> 00:36:23,677
Whatre you doing here?

595
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:30,517
A failed and feeble attempt
at doing the right thing.

596
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:33,320
Which was...

597
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:38,458
It's not important.
I'll take this from you.

598
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:47,634
Thank you.

599
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:49,168
You know,
I came in this town

600
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,770
Wanting to destroy it.

601
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:52,037
Tonight I...

602
00:36:52,105 --> 00:36:56,074
Found myself wanting
to protect it.

603
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:00,946
How does that happen?

604
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:03,682
I'm not a hero, elena.

605
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,817
I don'do good.

606
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:06,684
It's not in me.

607
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:09,621
Maybe it is.

608
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,089
No.

609
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:13,825
No, it's reserved
for my brother
and--and you,

610
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:15,860
Andonnie,

611
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,796
Even though
she has every
reason to te me,

612
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:22,166
Still helped
stefan save me.

613
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:24,501
Why do you sou
so surprised?

614
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:25,803
Because she did it
for you.

615
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:29,173
Which means
that somewhere
along the way,

616
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:33,677
You decided that
I was worth saving.

617
00:37:33,745 --> 00:37:35,413
And I wanted to...

618
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,381
Thank you for that.

619
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:43,219
You're welcome.

[music playing]

621
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,031
Hi.

622
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:32,299
It's late.

623
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:34,634
You should probably
come inside.

624
00:38:37,171 --> 00:38:39,339
[elena sighs]

625
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:50,082
What are you doing?

626
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,186
I don't want
to talk about it.

627
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:36,825
[chuckles] you scared me.

628
00:39:36,893 --> 00:39:39,495
Sorry.

629
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:43,632
Ohh.

630
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,369
You know, I first
met isobel when
I was a teenager.

631
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:49,004
I fell in love
with her instantly,

632
00:39:49,072 --> 00:39:50,639
Although I'm pretty sure

633
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:52,808
She never loved me.

634
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:54,643
She was special.

635
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:56,845
And part of why I hate
the vampir so much

636
00:39:56,913 --> 00:39:58,346
Is because
what she became.

637
00:39:58,414 --> 00:40:02,650
How it ruined her.

638
00:40:02,718 --> 00:40:04,185
And I never would have
sent her to damo

639
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:06,821
Had I known
she wanted to turn.

640
00:40:10,025 --> 00:40:12,359
It's my fault.

641
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:14,929
I'm telling you this

642
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:17,164
Because I hoped

643
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:19,299
Maybe you'd
understand.

644
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,805
Thank you.

645
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:28,241
Can I help?

646
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:33,379
Sure.

00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:48,260
I looked everywhere.

652
00:40:48,328 --> 00:40:51,630
Yeah, someone definitely
took my stuff.

653
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:55,033
I just gotta check
on jeremy before
I go to the hospital.

654
00:40:55,101 --> 00:40:57,568
Can you meet me there?

655
00:40:57,637 --> 00:41:01,472
Ok. I love you,
stefan.

656
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:07,778
Jeremy?

657
00:41:07,846 --> 00:41:08,912
You up?
