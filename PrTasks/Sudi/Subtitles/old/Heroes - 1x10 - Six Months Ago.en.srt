1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,212
To everything,
there is a season,

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,797
and a time to every purpose.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,937
The world needs to know about my
findings, that's all that's important!

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,732
It is one thing to publish a book
in the comfort of the university,

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,609
it is another to leave
everything behind,

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,539
chasing a theory that
is pure fantasy!

7
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,060
The earth spins at
1,000 miles an hour

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,104
as we desperately try to
keep from being thrown off.

9
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:25,442
Like the first blush of winter
that signals a great migration.

10
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:27,440
You're sweet.

11
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,821
I'm sweet!

12
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,281
Was there any warning
of their arrival?

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,490
She has a name: Jessica.

14
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,072
A sign,

15
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:39,992
a single event that set
this chain into motion?

16
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:45,082
- This is what you've been waiting for.
- Was it a whisper in God's ear?

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,710
Be the one we need.

18
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,961
Survive. Adapt. Escape.

19
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:53,051
And if we could mark that
single moment in time.

20
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:56,432
That first hint of the prophecy
of approaching danger...

21
00:00:56,648 --> 00:01:00,222
I found a tape of a conversation my
father had with a man named Sylar.

22
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:02,682
Hello, Chandra,
you made me this way.

23
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:04,850
Would we have done
anything differently?

24
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:08,313
Could it have been stopped?

25
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:11,322
You helped me to
discover my potential.

26
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,742
Or was the dye long ago cast?

27
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:15,782
And if we could go back,

28
00:01:15,955 --> 00:01:17,162
alter its course,

29
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:18,742
stop it from happening...

30
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:20,832
- Would we?
- I can go back.

31
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:22,121
Hiro.

32
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,382
My name is Hiro Nakamura!

33
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:38,470
I'm here to save your life!

34
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,263
Hey, Charlie!

35
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:43,812
Charlie, come on over here,
and blow out the candles!

36
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:45,432
Hold that thought, okay?

37
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,522
I just gotta make a wish.
Come on.

38
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:49,943
- Hi.
- Come on, honey!

39
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,152
P-Please, listen.

40
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:57,402
Very important.

41
00:01:57,748 --> 00:01:59,702
Say... "cheese."

42
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,420
Chapter Ten - Six Months Ago

43
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:49,041
Can I help you?

44
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,540
I hope so, Mr. Gray.

45
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:57,213
I can fix it.

46
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,552
My watch isn't broken.

47
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,683
Actually, it is.

48
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,731
Yeah, the self-winding
coil is loose.

49
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:16,151
- Your watch is running two seconds slow.
- How did you know?

50
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,782
Just a talent I have for
the way things work...

51
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:23,240
- How the parts should go.
- That looks rather complicated.

52
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:25,911
That...oh. The body's standard,
but the parts,

53
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:30,120
the insides, are German. 1917.

54
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:33,292
I've been working on
it for seven years.

55
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:38,882
How much do I owe you?

56
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:41,722
Oh, please.
Don't worry about it.

57
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,772
You didn't come
here for the watch.

58
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:51,190
I came to find you, Gabriel.

59
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:56,063
My name is Chandra Suresh.
I'm a geneticist.

60
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:58,051
I have a theory about
human evolution.

61
00:03:58,235 --> 00:03:59,612
And I believe you...

62
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,403
are a part of it. Read it.

63
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:03,960
If you'd like to talk more,

64
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:06,701
I've written my phone
number and address inside.

65
00:04:34,738 --> 00:04:36,483
License and registration.

66
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:39,401
Oh, this isn't my car,
I kinda stole it.

67
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:41,852
Can you take off the
glasses for me, please?

68
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:51,480
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the car.

69
00:04:51,797 --> 00:04:53,663
No, I don't feel like it.

70
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,542
That wasn't a suggestion.

71
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:57,672
Well, here's a suggestion.

72
00:04:57,886 --> 00:04:59,882
Why don't you go get
back in your car,

73
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:02,173
and eat a dozen donuts.

74
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,340
That is what you cops
like to do, right?

75
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:08,641
I said step out
of the car. Now.

76
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,601
I think you really want
to eat some donuts.

77
00:05:51,975 --> 00:05:53,721
Major developments!

78
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:57,101
Lori Trammel skanked her way
through the entire football team!

79
00:05:57,318 --> 00:05:59,861
- Who told you that?
- The entire football team.

80
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:02,822
Anyway, somehow she
found shame and resigned.

81
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,440
Turned in her pom-poms...

82
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,820
I'm in? Are you kidding?

83
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,740
Claire, destiny is calling you.

84
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:12,212
Come on, try it on.
You can model, I'll take pictures.

85
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,803
We'll totally
commiserate the event.

86
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:15,340
I think you mean "commemorate."

87
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:17,160
And... I'll try it on later.

88
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,760
'Kay, most girls can't wait
to get their uniforms on.

89
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,851
I mean, except Lori Trammel.
She couldn't wait to take it off.

90
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:24,510
Why do you have
to be like that?

91
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:26,561
Okay, first of all,
I've earned that.

92
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,283
And if you don't
want it or this,

93
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:30,643
Kristy Chan is salivating
for your position.

94
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:33,220
- No! I want it, I do.
- Then show it!

95
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:35,773
Show me some S, P, I, R, I, T!

96
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:38,310
- I'm not gonna drool!
- Then prove it, Claire!

97
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:39,772
Prove it!

98
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:47,073
Oh, my God.

99
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,030
-  What were you girls doing?
- Ugh, this is gonna need stitches.

100
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,922
I'm gonna take her to the emergency
room. Jackie, honey, grab my purse.

101
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:55,741
Let's go.
Come on, come on, honey.

102
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:58,663
Hello.

103
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,172
- Mr. Bennett?
- Yes.

104
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:02,170
My name is Chandra Suresh.

105
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,962
I need to speak to you
about your daughter Claire.

106
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:11,553
No, no.

107
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,640
I-I teleport from future.

108
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:16,220
- Do not go to work tomorrow.
- Hmm?

109
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:18,100
Very, very...

110
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:21,441
It wasn't raining yesterday.

111
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,400
Hmm?  Mm, April showers.

112
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,971
It's been storming all week.

113
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:28,033
April? No, no, October.

114
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:31,863
No, April 24th.
It's my birthday.

115
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:36,493
Six months?

116
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,082
I've got to get back.

117
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:41,580
If I teleport again I
could end up anywhere.

118
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:43,752
Lunch for a T-Rex!

119
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:45,253
I'M STUCK!

120
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,093
Birthday cake?

121
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,800
Happy Birthday.

122
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:11,822
Hi, my name is Niki.

123
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:14,990
And I'm an alcoholic.

124
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,161
Hi, Niki.

125
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:21,251
- I'm one year sober today.
- Happy anniversary!

126
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,513
I work 60 hours a week.

127
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:32,553
I stink of cigarettes.

128
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:37,140
I got a kid so smart that he
is flunking out of school.

129
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:39,103
My husband can't
find a job because

130
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:41,390
no one wants to hire an ex-con.

131
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,391
There's a leak in the roof.

132
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,650
And I'm feelin' thirsty.

133
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:49,113
Feels like too much
for one person.

134
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,703
So why are you here?

135
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:01,701
I don't want another year to go by
without you in my life, Nicole.

136
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:04,751
Not being in your life
was never my choice.

137
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:08,501
- You kinda made that happen.
- Look, I know how you feel about me.

138
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:12,630
And Lord knows I deserve it. I was
awful to you, and everyone I ever met.

139
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,091
You weren't awful,
you just weren't there.

140
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:17,801
You can't be awful if
you're not present.

141
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:21,392
You know, I'm married now.

142
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:23,983
I heard. Look, Nicole...

143
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:26,230
I would love to
meet him some time.

144
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:29,821
I-I really want to get to know
my grandson and my son-in-law.

145
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,531
And you.

146
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:38,160
Yeah, well, I don't know if
I'm ready to get to know you.

147
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,960
Hey. What's going...?

148
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:50,670
Ladies, 10 1/2.

149
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:54,232
Oh, you know, the reason I became a
nurse was to wear shoes like this,

150
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:55,690
- thank you very much.
- Of course.

151
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,402
- Get a drink?
- Yeah, it's right inside.

152
00:09:57,435 --> 00:10:00,100
- I told him it wasn't funny.
- I know.

153
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:02,562
- Hey, Mom.
- Hello, sweetheart.

154
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,890
- How are you? Come on in.
- I'm good.

155
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:08,983
Your father is
very proud of you.

156
00:10:09,405 --> 00:10:11,452
- And still couldn't make it.
- Well, he had a meeting.

157
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,123
Mr. Linderman's in
Atlantic City...

158
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:15,253
Listen, I-I did this
without his blessing,

159
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:16,530
and  without his money.

160
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:20,281
Okay? So I think it's only right
that we celebrate without him.

161
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:24,621
I have always wanted
a nurse in the family.

162
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:27,710
- We have enough lawyers.
- Thanks, Mom.

163
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:37,671
So, Peter,
have you chosen a specialty?

164
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,580
Uh, I'm thinking
of hospice care.

165
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:40,763
- Oh!
- Yeah.

166
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:43,231
- Taking care of dead people?
- They're not dead.

167
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,681
They're dying.
And I think it's noble.

168
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,272
Thank you.

169
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:50,982
- What's the pay?
- Ugh. Honey.

170
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,080
You know,
I'm gonna go call the sitter,

171
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:54,363
and when I come back...

172
00:10:54,615 --> 00:10:57,901
you are gonna dance with me.

173
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,291
What's going on?

174
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,132
The DA wants me to
prosecute Linderman.

175
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:18,133
- Dad's biggest client.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

176
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:19,260
Well,

177
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,932
the DA thinks Linderman's
mob ties run so deep,

178
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:25,131
if I can take him down,
the empire crumbles.

179
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:28,273
You do that, though,
Dad'll go down too.

180
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:30,733
You used to tell him

181
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,021
he was a criminal

182
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:34,060
for protecting criminals.

183
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,153
Here's a chance to
set things straight.

184
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,451
- Take the stink off the family na...
- He's still our father.

185
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:42,872
No matter what he's done.

186
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,371
You go after him,

187
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,692
you're never going
to forgive yourself.

188
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:48,951
Ever.

189
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:00,342
Come on, handsome.

190
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:06,013
- Hold this for me, will you?
- Yep.

191
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,681
May I?

192
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:30,543
So...

193
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:32,923
What? You're gonna cut me open?

194
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,040
I'd like to run some tests.

195
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,963
EEG, EKG, nothing invasive.

196
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:43,842
- A friend at Columbia has access to an MRI.
- Mapping the brain.

197
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:47,011
Measuring alpha waves,
resting rates, neuron clusters.

198
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:52,682
The brain controls every human action,
voluntary or involuntary.

199
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:55,903
Every breath, every heartbeat,
every emotion.

200
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:57,403
If the...

201
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:01,071
soul exists,
scientifically speaking,

202
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:03,493
it exists in the brain.

203
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,571
When I was a kid...

204
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,581
I used to wish some

205
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:14,250
stranger would come and tell me my
family wasn't really my family.

206
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:17,421
They weren't bad people,
they were just...

207
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,300
insignificant.

208
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,172
And I wanted to be different.

209
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:26,133
Special. I wanted to change.

210
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,390
A new name, a new life.

211
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,182
The watchmaker's son...

212
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:35,942
became a watchmaker.

213
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:38,652
It is so futile.

214
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,650
And I wanted to be...

215
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,322
important.

216
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,700
You are important, Gabriel.

217
00:13:47,248 --> 00:13:49,878
What do you think my
abilities might be?

218
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,253
Grand theft auto,
larceny, robbery, arson,

219
00:13:54,587 --> 00:13:57,123
and suspected of
murder in Oklahoma.

220
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:00,592
That's no way for a young
lady to behave, now is it?

221
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,923
You need a goal, Hayden.

222
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,302
A purpose.

223
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:15,142
Let me go. Now!

224
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:20,400
You know...

225
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:25,151
With your ability,
you can get anything you want.

226
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:26,823
Created your own morality.

227
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:30,823
There's no person in the world
that could say no to you.

228
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:37,292
Now there is.

229
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:44,252
Yamagato Industries.

230
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:46,511
Ando Masahashi, please.

231
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,470
Ando I need your help...

232
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:52,053
Sorry, Ando is sick.

233
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:54,183
This is Hiro Nakamura.

234
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:55,560
May I help you?

235
00:14:57,435 --> 00:14:59,310
Great Scott.

236
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:08,203
Matt.

237
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:10,570
What are you doing?

238
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,451
What?

239
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:15,342
What are you doing
sitting here?

240
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:17,201
Detective test is in an hour.

241
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:19,711
R ight.

242
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,851
- Oh, you're not chickening out, are you?
- No! No, man, of course not.

243
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,470
All right, good, 'cause second time's
the charm for you, I can feel it.

244
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:28,101
Just don't go being a nervous
wreck this time, okay?

245
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,050
What's up with the donut?

246
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:36,681
- Uh...
- Dude, you're like a walking cliché.

247
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:42,401
Yeah, well, you know what?

248
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:46,403
After today,
I am gonna be a different man.

249
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,152
Confidence! I like that.

250
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,991
Right? Let's go crush it.

251
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,241
Hello, what's up?

252
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:57,160
Hey.

253
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,912
Oh, I don't know what we'd
do without you, Hiro.

254
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,290
- You have such an amazing attitude.
- I have gift for you.

255
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:10,841
- Happy Birthday.
- Oh...

256
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:12,890
Mmm.

257
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:16,761
A Japanese phrasebook.

258
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,681
I love it.

259
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:22,902
Oh, now we can understand
each other better.

260
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:26,522
Maybe you visit Japan.
Very soon.

261
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:29,903
Get out of Midland, far away.

262
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,571
You are a kind
and generous man.

263
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,413
You speak Japanese
very quickly.

264
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:40,211
Lately, I've just been able
to remember everything.

265
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:44,922
You have power, big memory.

266
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,542
It will only get
stronger in the future.

267
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:50,883
The future. Right.

268
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:53,210
I keep forgetting that's
where you come from.

269
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:55,970
You don't believe me?
I bend time and space.

270
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:58,183
Oh,  yeah, of course you do.

271
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:05,063
Charlie, honey.
Your order's up.

272
00:17:06,617 --> 00:17:08,271
Hey!

273
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:12,320
- Where'd these come from?
- Flower store, two blocks from here.

274
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,071
Ha ha, funny.

275
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:18,283
Oh. Oh, hang on,
I have an order up.

276
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:20,913
Already finished.

277
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:24,833
Lynette!

278
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:27,080
You have got to see this!

279
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,753
Hiro's a magician!

280
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,462
Oh, no, it's not a trick.

281
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:35,092
You don't understand.

282
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:36,841
I'm trying to save your life.

283
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:42,931
A very, very bad man is
going to come here and...

284
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:53,942
Tomorrow, the swallow
will slay the dragon.

285
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,792
- Having a drink with your sister?
- Thinking about it.

286
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:15,513
Used to be, couldn't go an
hour without missing Jessica.

287
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:22,891
It's important not to forget.

288
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,523
Hal is back.

289
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:35,070
He came to one of my meetings.

290
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:37,361
He wants to meet you and Micah.

291
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:40,323
He won't meet anybody
unless you want him to.

292
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:42,780
He's got money.

293
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,583
He could...
he could help with tuition.

294
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:49,333
We can get Micah into
that private school.

295
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:52,632
Now, you wanna have Hal over,
let's have him over for dinner.

296
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:57,510
We can all say a
prayer for Jessica.

297
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:08,063
My brother Peter,
the hospice nurse.

298
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:09,741
Can you believe it?
It's just...

299
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:11,481
Oh, it's a perfect fit.

300
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:15,832
- He's selfless and empathic...
- He's self-centered and righteous. Self-righteous.

301
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:18,582
- He's a hell of a lot nicer than you.
- He can afford to be.

302
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,240
He hasn't been under
as much scrutiny.

303
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,410
My dad did what he had to do
to take care of his family,

304
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:28,312
and that's something that Peter
is never gonna understand.

305
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:29,962
And you do.

306
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,081
It's my responsibility.

307
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:35,961
It's my
inherited... birthright.

308
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,220
I didn't ask to be
Dad's favorite.

309
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:42,763
I never asked to be loved more
than Peter, but that's just...

310
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:44,933
the reality.

311
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:50,272
What does this guy want?

312
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:11,831
Nathan!

313
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,210
Heidi!

314
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:14,540
Nathan!

315
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,092
Aah!

316
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:24,392
Heidi!

317
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,230
Hello.

318
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,821
Hey. How is she?

319
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:48,123
She's been in surgery
for ten hours.

320
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,831
It's something with her back,
her spine.

321
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,223
I should probably call Mom.
She's got the kids.

322
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:57,082
- It's what Heidi would do.
- You have your phone? Yeah.

323
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:59,920
- You're not hurt?
- No.

324
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:02,421
Landed 300 feet away
from the wreck.

325
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:04,422
Couldn't tell you
how I got there.

326
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:06,152
Couldn't tell you much of
anything at this point.

327
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:07,892
Let me see that, let me see.

328
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:10,352
Yeah, that's a bad cut.
You need to lie down.

329
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:12,182
No, not until
Heidi's all right.

330
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,081
-  Won't get a signal.
- Do you remember the other car?

331
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,532
- What?
- In the accident.

332
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,241
Who told you that?

333
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,530
Who told you that?

334
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,160
I had a dream right
before you called.

335
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:33,870
My wife's in surgery,
and you're dreaming.

336
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:36,292
That's great.

337
00:21:36,585 --> 00:21:38,751
There was another car,
wasn't there?

338
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:41,843
Nathan.

339
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:46,090
Wasn't there?

340
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:49,813
Yeah.

341
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,393
It was Linderman's guys.

342
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:55,981
Must've found out
about the DA's plans.

343
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:58,252
It's my fault for
even considering it.

344
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:00,112
- Hey! Look at me.
- Taking them on.

345
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:01,751
This is...
this is not your fault.

346
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,781
This is Dad's fault, okay?
And you know,

347
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,741
you know that this
is not gonna end.

348
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:07,030
If...

349
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,990
If I agree to take
the DA's case,

350
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:12,372
will you give a deposition?

351
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:14,202
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

352
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:16,710
Against your father?

353
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:18,671
- Mr. Petrelli?
- Yes?

354
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:20,341
Please.

355
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:48,861
They did it!

356
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:53,241
See, the Swallows
slay the Dragons!

357
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,712
"The Tokyo Swallows defeated
the Chunichi Dragons yesterday

358
00:22:58,005 --> 00:23:00,431
with a surprising rally
with two out in the ninth."

359
00:23:00,468 --> 00:23:02,002
What, what is this? Baseball?

360
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,630
You read Japanese flawless.
In one day.

361
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:07,840
You have power.

362
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:09,800
I have power too.

363
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:11,553
Okay.

364
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:14,723
So because you knew this
baseball team was gonna win,

365
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:17,562
I'm supposed to believe
you're from the future.

366
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:22,361
There is an ancient Japanese
tradition, origami.

367
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:24,821
- Folding paper.
- I read about that.

368
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:27,650
Yeah, it says if a person
can fold 1000 cranes,

369
00:23:27,695 --> 00:23:30,321
- you'll be granted one wish.
- Yes.

370
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:45,841
How did you...

371
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:57,141
A trip to Japan?

372
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:00,351
I don't care if you
don't believe me. Just...

373
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:04,572
Please tell me you'll go.

374
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,443
Only one ticket?

375
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:17,413
- Just in case you said yes.
- Hai!

376
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,090
Why do you repair
watches, Gabriel?

377
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:28,512
My father didn't really
give me a choice.

378
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:31,972
Yes, but why not do what you want to do?
Why not change?

379
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,510
You use a phrase
in your book...

380
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:39,771
- Evolutionary imperative.
- That which we are destined to do.

381
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:42,900
Sea turtles die on the same
exact beach where they were born,

382
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:46,690
lions slaughter gazelles,
spiders eat their young.

383
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:49,612
They don't want to.
They have to.

384
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:51,031
Well...

385
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,613
The good news is
you're healthy.

386
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:57,620
You mean normal?

387
00:24:57,835 --> 00:24:59,912
- What, there's still no signs?
- No.

388
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:03,050
Well, maybe tomorrow.
We're still going to the CT scan, right?

389
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:05,581
I think we should prepare
for the possibility that

390
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,840
I may have been wrong.
You may not have a special ability.

391
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,800
I am so close.

392
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:13,300
I can feel it.

393
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:15,553
You came to me!

394
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:20,181
- I am on your list!
- These tests aren't 100%.

395
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,682
Don't give up on me.

396
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,033
There are other opportunities
I need to focus on.

397
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,853
What... what,
these people, huh?

398
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:27,611
They're important? This guy?

399
00:25:27,905 --> 00:25:30,231
Brian Davis,
you think he's... telekinetic?

400
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:31,790
Moves things with his mind,

401
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,951
or are you just gonna
toss him aside too?

402
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,201
You better leave now, Mr. Gray.

403
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,563
Wow!

404
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,390
That's a very
generous gift, Hal.

405
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:06,312
Oh, it's amortized
over 10 birthdays.

406
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:08,813
Hell, then, you skimped.

407
00:26:09,906 --> 00:26:12,862
- Thanks, Grandpa.
- It's my pleasure, young man.

408
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,822
Now, go break the internet in half,
or something.

409
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:21,123
If I could buy stock in
that kid right now...

410
00:26:21,168 --> 00:26:24,250
God, I wish his teachers
saw it that way.

411
00:26:24,508 --> 00:26:26,793
We want to move him
into a private school,

412
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:29,891
it's just, you know,
we're trying to figure out the details.

413
00:26:29,928 --> 00:26:31,632
Details?

414
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:34,552
If you're trying to
ask me for something,

415
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:36,632
it's already yours.

416
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,223
It's a man's God-give right
to dote on his grandson.

417
00:26:41,055 --> 00:26:42,603
Thank you.

418
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,313
It'd make a really
big difference for us.

419
00:26:47,027 --> 00:26:49,873
Well, you know, I feel lucky that
you even let me through the door,

420
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:53,193
- after all the things I've done.
- Stop saying that.

421
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:56,183
- You didn't do anything.
- Why do you keep doing that?

422
00:26:56,826 --> 00:26:58,410
Doing what?

423
00:26:58,995 --> 00:27:02,373
You... you're only as sick
as your secrets, Nicole.

424
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:06,711
I know the mantras, Hal.

425
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:09,420
I've been reciting
them for over a year.

426
00:27:13,347 --> 00:27:18,261
Well, I guess I'll go see
what the boy's up to now.

427
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:25,223
You are doing great.

428
00:27:29,697 --> 00:27:33,650
What the hell is this? You've torn
the whole damned computer apart!

429
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:36,781
- That computer cost $2,000.
- Hey!

430
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:39,861
- What the hell you think you're doing?
- You okay?

431
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:44,280
I have no business being here.

432
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,752
Then why did you bother?

433
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:51,631
I owe you more than an
apology could ever do.

434
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:54,551
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- I don't know.

435
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:58,010
Make your life easier,
I don't care how, okay?

436
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:03,352
What did you do that was so bad
I can't have my father back?

437
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:06,220
You really don't remember,
do you?

438
00:28:17,575 --> 00:28:19,990
So what's going to
happen to my Claire?

439
00:28:20,247 --> 00:28:21,573
How is this...

440
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:24,451
This genetic abnormality
going to effect her?

441
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:27,872
I don't know.
It's possible nothing might ever happen.

442
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,660
It's possible.
I might be wrong.

443
00:28:31,257 --> 00:28:33,043
Where did you find
this picture?

444
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,713
Union Wells High
School website.

445
00:28:36,885 --> 00:28:39,132
She's growing up
so quickly now.

446
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:42,843
I couldn't do
anything to stop it.

447
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:44,340
You cannot,

448
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:46,310
try as you might.

449
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,182
You have a daughter?

450
00:28:48,815 --> 00:28:52,603
- How old is she?
- She... was five.

451
00:28:54,946 --> 00:28:56,322
I'm so sorry.

452
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:58,360
Mutations are

453
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:03,162
much like cancers or diseases,
meant to eliminate a species.

454
00:29:03,536 --> 00:29:07,780
Shanti had a genetic anomaly, and
that was the portal into my research.

455
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,250
My hope is that no one
will suffer as she did.

456
00:29:11,506 --> 00:29:12,963
If you do figure this out,

457
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,421
what happens then?

458
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:18,212
We can change the world.

459
00:29:18,596 --> 00:29:20,460
Give people hope
for the future.

460
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,882
That is your
daughter's destiny.

461
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,473
I'd, um,
very much like to meet her.

462
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,391
You can see how that
might be a problem.

463
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,022
For my family?

464
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,520
Yes, of course.

465
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,940
Let me think on this and
the best way to proceed.

466
00:29:38,157 --> 00:29:41,323
Well, I appreciate your coming,
Mr. Bennett.

467
00:29:41,785 --> 00:29:43,653
It was educational.

468
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:06,012
You do remember.

469
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:09,351
Oh, how could I forget?

470
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:15,100
- Nicole!
- Not Niki.

471
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:18,400
It's me, Daddy, Jessica.

472
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,862
The daughter that you
threw beer bottles at.

473
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:23,692
The daughter that you choked.

474
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:25,703
The daughter that you killed.

475
00:30:25,747 --> 00:30:27,413
I didn't kill anyone!

476
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:30,033
No... It was an accident.

477
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,881
And they left Niki with you
to be your punching bag.

478
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,753
- I came to apologize, Nicole.
- Apologize?

479
00:30:36,087 --> 00:30:37,963
You don't apologize to Nicole.

480
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:40,542
You apologize to me.

481
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:45,511
Niki doesn't remember.

482
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:47,380
But I do.

483
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,512
Someone had to be
there to protect her.

484
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:53,223
I remember the stink of
alcohol on your breath.

485
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:56,940
I took every punch,
so that she wouldn't have to.

486
00:30:58,988 --> 00:30:59,580
You are not Jessica.

487
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:01,860
You have no idea who I am.

488
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:06,862
Nicole...

489
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,411
You need help.

490
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,570
You're right, she does.

491
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,710
I thought she had learned
to protect herself,

492
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,370
but no such luck.

493
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:20,292
You're going to go away,
and never come back.

494
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:38,141
Cheerleading, huh?

495
00:31:40,657 --> 00:31:44,983
- What do you think?
- I think I can't wait to go to my first game.

496
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,280
Ah, well,

497
00:31:50,537 --> 00:31:52,003
you might be getting
a little bit old

498
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,333
for the bears from
around the world, but...

499
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,081
- No, I'm not.
- No?

500
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:58,292
- I love my bears.
- Aww.

501
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:05,380
- Am I a terrible person?
- What are you talking about?

502
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,510
I wanna be a cheerleader.

503
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:10,470
I mean, I've worked hard to
be a cheerleader, but...

504
00:32:10,726 --> 00:32:12,970
Sometimes Jackie
can just be a...

505
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:14,392
A bitch.

506
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:18,482
Yeah, a bitch.

507
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:21,163
No, it's your actions that
make you good or bad,

508
00:32:21,195 --> 00:32:23,231
cheerleader or not.

509
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,110
Let's take a look at that hand.

510
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:29,742
The pain went away,
but I think it's still kinda...

511
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:35,371
That's healed really nicely.

512
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,331
Hey, baby.

513
00:32:46,676 --> 00:32:48,012
You hungry?

514
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:52,302
Thought I'd make some eggs...
carbonara style.

515
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,010
Does that sound good?

516
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:56,893
I didn't pass again.

517
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,312
You studied so hard.

518
00:33:00,736 --> 00:33:01,952
It's not about
the answers, Jan.

519
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:03,651
I know all the answers.

520
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,781
I don't know why you don't
just tell them the truth.

521
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:07,950
Yeah, I'll just waltz in and
tell them I can barely read,

522
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,933
half the words I see backwards.
There's a good career move.

523
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:14,451
- My baby.
- Don't.

524
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:16,163
Come on.

525
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:18,792
A little morning sex,

526
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:21,332
some eggs...

527
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,252
Everything's gonna
seem so much better.

528
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:28,210
- How can you wanna kiss me?
- You're my hero. Don't you know that?

529
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:34,640
Hey. You are everything
that I want.

530
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:40,603
Yeah, I'm your hero.

531
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:43,390
I'm a hero.

532
00:33:43,895 --> 00:33:45,231
Look at me.

533
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:48,730
11 years,
and I am still directing traffic.

534
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:01,417
Hey.

535
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,162
I'm ready to give
the deposition.

536
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,040
There isn't going to be one.

537
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:08,090
What are you talking about?

538
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:11,340
Can't back out now,
we gotta tell the DA everything.

539
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:13,390
About Linderman,
about Dad, all of it.

540
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:15,012
Dad's dead.

541
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,890
He had a heart
attack this morning.

542
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,613
Take comfort in the fact
that he didn't know his sons

543
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:27,983
were about to stab
him in the back.

544
00:34:35,618 --> 00:34:37,031
Charlie! Charlie!

545
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,701
24-hour Samurai Film Festival
at the Drafthouse in Austin!

546
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:44,121
Austin? That's over
300 miles away.

547
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:49,041
We can make it in time to see Yujimbo,
Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress.

548
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:51,590
It'd be perfect for
our trip to Japan!

549
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:55,052
You still do want to go?

550
00:34:55,976 --> 00:34:59,263
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
No, it's not that.

551
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:02,310
It's just, um,
ever since I met you...

552
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,183
I don't know, you just,
you've made me so happy.

553
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:07,940
You make me happy too.

554
00:35:07,988 --> 00:35:10,020
Well, it's more than that.

555
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:13,691
I don't let people
get very close.

556
00:35:17,497 --> 00:35:20,571
There's a blood
clot in my brain...

557
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:23,041
inches away from an aneurysm.

558
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,921
I'm dying.

559
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:32,090
But... I'm supposed
to save you.

560
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:35,383
Oh, you did. You did.

561
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:38,091
Before you got here,
I'd decided to give up.

562
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:42,801
But you have made
me feel more alive,

563
00:35:43,106 --> 00:35:47,021
and more full of joy than
I could have ever imagined.

564
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:52,233
Hiro, I love you.

565
00:36:04,627 --> 00:36:06,162
Charlie?

566
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:11,831
No...

567
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,010
Charlie? Charlie! Charlie!

568
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:21,470
Aren't you and Ando
supposed to be...

569
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:22,890
on vacation in America?

570
00:36:23,185 --> 00:36:24,051
I jumped.

571
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,600
Dammit.

572
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:27,602
I have to get back to her.

573
00:36:27,988 --> 00:36:29,690
I have to get back to Charlie.

574
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:11,352
Can I help you?

575
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,690
Yeah, um, somebody called me?

576
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:15,270
My name is Brian Davis.

577
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:22,742
Yes, I called you.

578
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:24,950
My name is...

579
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:32,042
My name is Sylar.

580
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:35,830
Gabriel Sylar.

581
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:59,111
- It's incredible.
- Can you make it go away?

582
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,191
Why would you wanna do that?

583
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:03,071
I don't know what this is.

584
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:04,911
Or who I might hurt.

585
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:06,492
I don't want it.

586
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:13,412
- You're broken.
- What?

587
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:17,542
Suresh was right.
It's so clear now.

588
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,923
How it all works,
pieces fitting together.

589
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,473
- It is in the brain.
- So you can help.

590
00:38:25,058 --> 00:38:28,430
Don't worry, Brian,
I can fix it.

591
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:31,103
It's an
evolutionary imperative.

592
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:43,493
Whatever bad you've done in the past,
it's over.

593
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:48,450
You have a rare
opportunity to start again,

594
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:51,200
to rewrite the past,
to do better.

595
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:53,560
But if you're not interested,
we could just

596
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:56,000
put you back in your old life.

597
00:38:56,675 --> 00:38:59,381
Odds are you'd be
dead in a week.

598
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,881
What do you want me to do?

599
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:09,552
There's a professor.
Dr. Suresh.

600
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,970
He has a list of names.

601
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:15,850
You're going to get Claire
Bennet's name off that list.

602
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:40,210
- I'm sorry about the glass.
- It's just glass.

603
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:45,961
About the other day...
I should've behaved myself.

604
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:49,262
- I was uncalled for, I'm sorry.
- You were angry.

605
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:51,262
A man can say and do

606
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,312
the most awful things
when he's angry.

607
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:57,191
Well, I'm different now. I feel I've
been given a chance to start over.

608
00:39:57,235 --> 00:39:59,310
A new life, new identity.

609
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,651
New purpose.

610
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:07,321
I came halfway around the world looking
for proof, threw him out the door.

611
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:11,410
No one returns my phone calls anymore.
They all think I'm insane.

612
00:40:11,706 --> 00:40:12,951
I don't.

613
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,830
These people

614
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:19,370
are all out there waiting to be
told that they are important.

615
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:22,713
Waiting to unlock their true potential.
I know it.

616
00:40:23,677 --> 00:40:26,461
I can feel them.

617
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:29,510
We'll find them together.

618
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:32,641
We are the future.

619
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,441
Hiro.

620
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:53,703
Hiro!

621
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,163
You're okay!

622
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,753
No, I'm not okay.

623
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:02,180
What are you talking about?

624
00:41:02,216 --> 00:41:03,751
You teleported back!

625
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:06,170
I took the bus.

626
00:41:08,517 --> 00:41:10,052
I teleported.

627
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:10,971
Forward.

628
00:41:10,976 --> 00:41:12,091
Backward.

629
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:14,680
But I couldn't save her.

630
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,223
I couldn't save Charlie.

631
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:21,602
- So, try again.
- It won't work.

632
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:23,350
This power...

633
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,271
it's bigger than me.

634
00:41:26,405 --> 00:41:28,362
I can't change the past.

635
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:30,323
No matter how hard I wish.

636
00:41:34,538 --> 00:41:36,072
I failed.

637
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:46,920
This list...

638
00:41:48,468 --> 00:41:49,963
You found them.

639
00:41:50,306 --> 00:41:51,721
These people...

640
00:41:53,188 --> 00:41:56,353
Their future is
written on their DNA.

641
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:59,603
Just as the past, it seems,
is written in stone.

642
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:02,061
I have something I
have to tell you.

643
00:42:03,195 --> 00:42:06,190
Was the die cast from
the very beginning?

644
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:11,400
Or is it in our own hands to
alter the course of destiny?

645
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,321
Of all our abilities,

646
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:16,872
it is free will that
truly makes us unique.

647
00:42:17,377 --> 00:42:22,371
With it, we have a tiny,
but potent, chance to deny fate.

648
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,331
And only with it

649
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:28,380
can we find our way
back to being human.

650
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,550
I loved her.

651
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:43,523
