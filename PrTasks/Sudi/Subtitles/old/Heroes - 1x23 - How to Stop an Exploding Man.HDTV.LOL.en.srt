1
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,056
<i>Where does it come from?</i>

2
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:11,876
<i>This quest?</i>

3
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:17,919
<i>This need to solve life's mysteries</i>

4
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,895
<i>when the simplest of questions
can never be answered.</i>

5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,097
<i>Why are we here?</i>

6
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:34,909
<i>What is the soul?</i>

7
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:36,345
<i>Why do we dream?</i>

8
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:47,750
<i>Perhaps we'd be better off
not looking at all.</i>

9
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,148
<i>Not delving,
not yearning.</i>

10
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:59,374
<i>But that's not human nature,
not the human heart.</i>

11
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,808
<i>That is not
why we are here.</i>

12
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:10,581
<i>Yet sill we struggle
to make a difference,</i>

13
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:13,565
<i>to change the world,
to dream of hope.</i>

14
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,725
<i>Never knowing for certain
who we will meet along the way.</i>

15
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:25,586
<i>Who among the world of strangers
will hold our hand.</i>

16
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:32,095
<i>Touch our hearts.</i>

17
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:38,246
<i>And share the pain of trying.</i>

18
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:43,836
You don't love him.

19
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:47,734
Everything I've done,
I did for them.

20
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:55,906
You should've takenthe money.

21
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:08,991
Why did you take that bullet?

22
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:11,570
You could've let it
phase right through you.

23
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:15,236
It's okay.

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Go.

25
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,543
Forget about me.

26
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:21,076
Save Micah.

27
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,661
You can get us out of here.

28
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:26,243
- You can walk us through this wall.
- I don't know if I can.

29
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:27,420
You got to do this.

30
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:36,645
You can do this.

31
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:43,921
Surveillance picked them up
in the elevator.

32
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:47,149
What does he want?

33
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:48,962
Molly.

34
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:53,367
What am I thinking now, Parkman?

35
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:55,025
Your last thought.

36
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,134
Lower your gun.

37
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:12,494
Shoot me and she dies.

38
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:15,601
As long as she's alive,
my daughter will never be safe.

39
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:16,947
None of them will.

40
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,315
You'll take the life of one little girl
to save another?

41
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,423
If I have to.

42
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:24,501
Taking her life
would save thousands.

43
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:25,855
And Thompson?

44
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:27,949
Did you save thousands
of lives by killing him?

45
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:30,106
No, just my own.

46
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:35,524
Officer Parkman?

47
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,587
You know this man?

48
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:44,088
I told you he was coming.

49
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:47,559
He promised to keep me safe.

50
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,872
That's right.

51
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:53,187
And nobody
is gonna hurt you.

52
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:01,601
Peter Petrelli.

54
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:19,613
<i>I challenge everyone here tonight
to inspire by example.</i>

55
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:22,830
<i>To fight the battle,
no matter the cost.</i>

56
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:27,413
<i>The world is sick,
spinning out of control.</i>

57
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:30,411
<i>But we can heal it.</i>

58
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:34,204
Patty and the boys should be landing
in Nantucket any minute.

59
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:37,329
Chopper's gonna meet us
up on the roof in an hour.

60
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:42,650
What is it, Ma?

61
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:44,339
It's Linderman.

62
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:45,838
He's dead.

63
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,149
- How?
- Someone got to him in his office.

64
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:54,304
He was murdered.

65
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:58,554
This is a terrible tragedy, Nathan.

66
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:04,399
Yes, it is.

67
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:08,748
But it doesn't change anything.
The plan wasn't just his.

68
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:11,632
You know that, Congressman.

69
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:17,264
Yeah.

70
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:23,770
After the explosion,
the city is gonna need me, Ma.

71
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,620
America's gonna need me.
The world.

72
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:32,743
This changes nothing.

73
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:45,444
42, Micah's on this floor.

74
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:47,106
You go.
I'm only gonna slow you down.

75
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:49,059
I'm not leaving you.
You'll die if I do.

76
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:52,503
I can't go with you, Nik.
You have to do this alone.

77
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:53,706
You have to find Micah.

78
00:07:53,828 --> 00:07:54,837
- I can't.
- You can.

79
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,505
You were strong enough.
You always have been.

80
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,038
I'm coming back for you.

81
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,418
You stay right here, you understand me?

82
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,907
Linderman's guards will be all over us
if they find Thompson's body.

83
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:15,992
Maybe you should've thought
before you shot him.

84
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:17,243
It was self-defense.

85
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:18,524
And Molly Walker?

86
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,976
What's your excuse
for nearly shooting her?

87
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:22,878
She's dangerous.

88
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,057
You're gonna need to start
trusting me, Dr. Suresh.

89
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:29,744
Yes, because that's worked out
really well for me before.

90
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:30,919
Look...

91
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:34,384
the organization
that I used to work for...

92
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,690
once stood for something.

93
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,975
Now... it's been corrupted.

94
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:42,397
Used to work for?

95
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:44,279
The only thing
that's important to me now

96
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:46,125
is protecting my family.

97
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:49,185
I will never let Molly
be used to hurt anyone.

98
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,637
She can do good in this world.

99
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:53,444
I don't think you understand
the true nature of this organization.

100
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:56,021
And you don't understand
how important she is to me.

101
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:57,984
It was my antibodies that saved her.

102
00:08:58,149 --> 00:08:59,675
I'm responsible for her life.

103
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,631
There's something wrong with Molly.

104
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,056
- Dad.
- Claire, where are you?

105
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:13,107
<i>Still in New York.
I'm with Peter, but there's a problem.</i>

106
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:15,924
Ted Sprague's dead.

107
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Sylar killed him.

108
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:22,463
Dad?

109
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:24,842
Put Peter on the phone, please.

110
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,300
He wants to talk to you.

111
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:33,154
When you came into contact with Ted,
you absorbed his power.

112
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:35,151
That's right.

113
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:36,923
<i>Now that Sylar's absorbed it too,</i>

114
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:40,087
I think you may be
the only one who can stop him.

115
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,667
Now all we have to do is find him.
Any idea where we start?

116
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:48,406
There's a tracking system here.

117
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,509
We're trying to fix it now.

118
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:52,673
As soon as we do,
we'll find him.

119
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:53,964
And if you don't?

120
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:57,880
You just stay close to Claire's phone.

121
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:01,721
<i>I'll contact you the second
we have a location.</i>

122
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:03,933
And whatever you do...

123
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:07,679
you keep Claire safe.

124
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:09,720
You understand?

125
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:11,563
Yeah.

126
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:22,395
What are we doing here?

127
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,218
I actually believed you.

128
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,801
You lied to me.
You said you weren't gonna call him.

129
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:40,045
I know, but think about it.
We can't do this alone.

130
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:41,622
No, you think about it.

131
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,575
We can't trust him.

132
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:46,482
Yes, we can trust him.
Nathan has never let me down.

133
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:48,728
Nathan doesn't care about you.

134
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:50,093
He doesn't care about anyone.

135
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:52,318
He doesn't care about me,
and I'm his own daughter.

136
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,454
- We do not need him!
- Yes, we do!

137
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:58,624
- Why?
- Because I'm afraid, okay?

138
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,115
And I need my brother
to help us.

139
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,207
<i>You lied to me, Peter.</i>

140
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:09,608
<i>I trusted you.</i>

141
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:21,156
What's the emergency?

142
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:23,851
The bomb.
It's not me, it's Sylar.

143
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:27,247
He killed Ted Sprague,
which means he's radioactive.

144
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,411
And if he explodes...

145
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:31,532
Look...

146
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:34,467
I know that this is a lot to process,

147
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:36,493
but it is real, I swear.

148
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:38,542
And I don't have
a lot of time to find him.

149
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:40,642
What do you want me to do?

150
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,149
I don't know.
Just... help me.

151
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:46,814
Come here.

152
00:11:49,512 --> 00:11:50,929
If what you're saying is real,

153
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:53,365
then there's no reason
to involve Claire in this.

154
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:55,928
- It's just too dangerous.
- No, she has to stay with me.

155
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:57,469
She's just a kid, Pete.

156
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,146
If I find Sylar
and I'm able to stop him,

157
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,891
then she's the only one who can stop me
if something goes wrong.

158
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,216
You're gonna be fine.

159
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,210
How do you know?

160
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:09,658
You told me you... you could regenerate,
that you could survive.

161
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:12,550
<i>There's nothing you can
do to stop it, Peter.</i>

162
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:14,368
<i>They're all gonna die.</i>

163
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:18,588
What is it?

164
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:21,507
Claire was right about you.

165
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:28,953
What are you talking about?

166
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,722
No, no!
This isn't happening.

167
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:14,967
How much longer
before she's up and running?

168
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:16,180
She's not a machine.

169
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:18,536
I just gave her the transfusion.
It'll take some time.

170
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:20,705
Take too much time,
and the city will pay for it.

171
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:22,340
Sylar's out there.

172
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,620
- You mean the boogeyman?
- Don't try to get up.

173
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:32,407
I can do it.

174
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,989
I can tell you where he is.

175
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:36,776
Okay.
So... how do we do this?

176
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,512
I just...

177
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,115
I think about him in my mind,

178
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:44,166
then I point to him on the map there.

179
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:46,425
I need a push pin.

180
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:50,252
So you can find anyone in the world?
You just need to think about them?

181
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,613
Almost anyone.

182
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:54,360
Almost?

183
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:57,182
There's only one that I can't.

184
00:13:58,884 --> 00:13:59,889
Who's that?

185
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:06,472
Is it someone bad, Molly,
like the boogeyman?

186
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:09,674
No.

187
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:11,485
He's a lot worse.

188
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:14,742
And why don't you want to find him?

189
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:17,981
'Cause when I think about him...

190
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,767
he can see me.

191
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:30,714
Can you think about Sylar now?

192
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,131
He's there.

193
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:58,567
That's the Lower East Side.

194
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,933
Somewhere around Reed Street.

195
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:03,798
Isaac's loft.

196
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,402
Isaac Mendez?
The painter?

197
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:08,633
- Who?
- I've gotta call Peter.

198
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:11,670
Why don't you let me
answer that for you.

199
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:20,215
No, this is her grandmother.

200
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:25,083
- Where is she?
- Where she belongs, with her family.

201
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:26,493
Dad!

202
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:28,305
I'm her family.

203
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:33,486
<i>No, you're the man we gave her to
to look after, to keep safe.</i>

204
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,247
A job you haven't done
particularly well.

205
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:39,187
What are you gonna do with her?

206
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:42,095
Take her someplace far enough
to keep her out of harm's way.

207
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:44,420
I suggest you do the same.

208
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:46,211
There isn't much time.

209
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,021
Let me say goodbye to her.

210
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:57,192
Dad.

211
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,134
Are you okay?

212
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:04,337
I'm just trying to get away
from these people.

213
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:07,657
<i>You're better off going with them.</i>

214
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:08,880
What?!

215
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:10,067
<i>She's right.</i>

216
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:11,464
You shouldn't be here.

217
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:14,880
But as soon as you're safe
out of the city,

218
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:17,974
you try and get away.
Do you understand?

219
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:25,944
I need to find Peter.
Where is he?

220
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,344
I don't know. They won't tell me.

221
00:16:28,494 --> 00:16:29,714
That's long enough, dear.

222
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:34,708
Tell me you have a plan, Dad.

223
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:37,617
I have a plan.

224
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:41,220
I love you, Claire.

225
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:43,304
I love you too.

226
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:50,728
We have a new priority.
Peter Petrelli. We have to find him.

227
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:51,993
What for?

228
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:54,154
We know where Sylar is.
We can go after him.

229
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,335
Not without Petrelli.
He's the only one who can stop him.

230
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:01,037
I've come 3,000 miles.
I left my pregnant wife at home.

231
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:03,406
He's a bad guy. I'm a cop.
I'm going after him.

232
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,146
Then he will kill you.

233
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:08,304
Yeah, we'll see.

234
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,282
There you are, sir.

235
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:50,429
Thank you.

236
00:17:58,531 --> 00:17:59,667
Hi.
Hi.

237
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:01,855
I'm Peter.
I'm your father's new nurse.

238
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,181
Yes, I've heard.

239
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,430
I'm Simone Deveaux.

240
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:06,092
Nice to meet you.

241
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,332
Your mother seems to know
my father somehow.

242
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:09,683
Yeah, she's, uh...

243
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,474
yeah, she's, uh...
sorry.

244
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:19,634
My mother, she's...
She's full of surprises.

245
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:22,936
I want to thank you.

246
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:25,128
I know it's a real hard job.

247
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:26,741
Dying is hard.

248
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:28,875
What I do, it's just...

249
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,044
- I'm here to help.
- No, you're a real hero

250
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:35,513
to care for a perfect
stranger like this.

251
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,919
This may sound strange, but...

252
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:42,061
your father's last few weeks,
his death...

253
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,839
it could be beautiful
if you let it be.

254
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:47,601
Sure, a piece of cake.

255
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:50,669
I'm not saying it's not tragic for you.

256
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:52,742
I'm just saying...

257
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:56,317
you know, death is the one thing
that connects us all.

258
00:18:56,992 --> 00:18:58,740
Reminds us that's
what really important

259
00:18:58,914 --> 00:19:00,331
is who we've touched,
and...

260
00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:03,161
how much we've given.

261
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,564
Makes us realize that...

262
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:09,658
we have to be good to one another.

263
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,617
See, your father...

264
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:14,682
he's the real hero.

265
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,554
Not me.

266
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:23,720
Come on, I'll show you the apartment.

267
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,555
Get you settled in.

268
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,817
Believe me, if he knew,
you'd know,

269
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:33,465
There's a look you just can't hide
when it first shows.

270
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:35,493
What about Nathan?

271
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:38,725
Linderman tells me
Nathan will be ready to play his part.

272
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:40,644
Well, he's been wrong before.

273
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:42,834
Meaning what exactly?

274
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,905
I think that Linderman
is betting on the wrong brother.

275
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:47,933
We talking about
the same Peter here?

276
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,868
I look in Peter's eyes,
I see compassion, empathy.

277
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:53,176
But most of all,
I see hope.

278
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,965
This world won't be saved on strength.

279
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:57,353
What it really needs

280
00:19:57,548 --> 00:19:59,407
is heart,
and that's Peter.

281
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,241
Charles, don't get me wrong.

282
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:04,407
I love Peter, but that poor kid
can barely get out of his own way.

283
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:06,370
He's ruled by insecurities.

284
00:20:06,992 --> 00:20:07,992
He's weak.

285
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:10,852
No, trust me.

286
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:12,671
This bomb is going to go off.

287
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:17,843
And Nathan is going to be
the one the world turns to.

288
00:20:19,182 --> 00:20:21,392
I don't believe
this tragedy's inevitable.

289
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:25,164
Well, then... one of us
is going to be right.

290
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:27,710
And one of us won't.

291
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:30,705
Well, I'm glad I won't be alive
to see which one that is.

292
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,371
You are in my prayers, Charles.

293
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:36,556
I could use them.

294
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:40,514
Good-bye,
my dear, dear friend.

295
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,343
I know you're there, Peter.

296
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,945
Looks like you dropped something.

297
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:59,097
A comic book that predicts the future.

298
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:01,996
What will they think of next?

299
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:05,493
You're kidding.

300
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,863
This is how Isaac thought I'd die?

301
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,610
Stabbed by a silly little man!

302
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:12,198
Hiro is not silly.

303
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:14,947
You should've seen the look on his face
when he tried to kill me.

304
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,825
You cannot take my brain.

305
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:17,992
Please.

306
00:22:18,244 --> 00:22:20,033
What would I want with your brain?

307
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:24,735
Where is Peter Petrelli?

308
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:25,906
I don't know.

309
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:33,339
Where is he?

310
00:22:37,652 --> 00:22:38,652
Let him go.

311
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,322
I don't think I'm going to.

312
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:47,952
All you have to do is stop time

313
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:49,445
before I cut off his head.

314
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:53,350
Do you think you can
do your little trick

315
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,056
before I can do mine?

316
00:23:33,132 --> 00:23:34,132
How?

317
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:38,984
You can't be here.

318
00:23:39,194 --> 00:23:40,194
Look what you did.

319
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Oh, my God!

320
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,902
It's all your fault, Niki.

321
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,382
D.L., now Micah.

322
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:56,999
They're both gone...

323
00:23:58,058 --> 00:23:59,351
because you were weak.

324
00:24:00,194 --> 00:24:01,194
Micah, please.

325
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,938
The wrong sister died.
It should've been you.

326
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:05,695
Face it, Niki.

327
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:07,631
You're nothing.

328
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:09,834
I'm the one they needed.

329
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:06,848
Molly, we need to go now.

330
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:09,386
Where are we going?

331
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:12,272
Officer Parkman called.
He believes that Sylar...

332
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,634
he believe the boogeyman
is on his way.

333
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,919
No.

334
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:19,749
He's not on his way.

335
00:25:21,132 --> 00:25:22,132
He's already here.

336
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:28,090
I have to get some paperwork.

337
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,186
I'm not gonna be
coming back to my office.

338
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,707
Helicopter's picking us up
from the roof in ten minutes.

339
00:25:32,883 --> 00:25:35,537
When the jet lands tomorrow morning,
you'll be safe.

340
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:37,613
But everyone else will be dead.

341
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:48,587
How can you do nothing to stop this?

342
00:25:49,077 --> 00:25:50,270
It's inevitable, dear.

343
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:52,042
There's nothing anyone can do about it.

344
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,574
That's insane!

345
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:57,412
Nothing is inevitable.
The future is not written in stone.

346
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:01,930
I'm afraid this one is.

347
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:03,943
If everything is so inevitable,

348
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:06,908
then why has she been trying
to keep us apart all these years?

349
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:13,037
There are things you simply
aren't mature enough to understand yet.

350
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:17,599
Yeah, like how you can
let your own son die like this.

351
00:26:20,102 --> 00:26:21,220
Your own brother.

352
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:24,692
He's not gonna die.

353
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:27,534
Thanks to you,
Peter has the ability to survive.

354
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:30,438
So he lives...

355
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,387
and kills millions of people.

356
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:38,237
How can you let him be responsible
for something like that?

357
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:40,634
And how can you live
with yourself if he is?

358
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,516
Claire, I know that it's hard
for you to trust me right now.

359
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:50,207
But this is all gonna
make sense very soon.

360
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:54,019
I promise.

361
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:57,302
We're offering you
everything you've ever wanted, Claire.

362
00:26:58,406 --> 00:26:59,507
A place to belong.

363
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:01,382
A family.

364
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:19,371
I already have a family.

365
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,709
I know what you're thinking, Nathan.

366
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:49,883
Let her go.

367
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,720
You understand.

368
00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:20,677
How many times
have I saved your ass?

369
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm the only reason
that you're still alive.

370
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:27,245
That's not me.

371
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:29,715
Stop her.
Find Micah.

372
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,587
What?

373
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:34,230
I said stop her.

374
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:36,100
That's not me.

375
00:28:38,307 --> 00:28:39,556
I'm not strong enough.

376
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,939
Who the hell are you talking to?

377
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:00,387
Mom?

378
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,212
Mom, I'm in here!
It's locked!

379
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:11,941
Is it really you?

380
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:17,141
It's me, baby.

381
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:20,849
It's just me.

382
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:46,232
Wait!
He could be a bad guy.

383
00:29:47,438 --> 00:29:48,480
He needs my help.

384
00:29:52,987 --> 00:29:54,574
Okay, we need to get him out of here.

385
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:03,210
It's not working.

386
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,335
They've must have shut it down.

387
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:07,788
Okay, I need a lookout.
Can you do that?

388
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,374
Stand over here
and keep an eye out.

389
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:11,389
If anyone comes,
tell me straight away.

390
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,980
Invisibility.

391
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:55,096
Always thought that
that would be a good one to have.

392
00:31:55,585 --> 00:31:57,566
I don't understand.
How is this happening?

393
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,603
You're alive.

394
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,603
Is this a dream?

395
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,844
Am I time traveling?

396
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:06,916
Are you doing this?

397
00:32:07,604 --> 00:32:09,695
Doesn't really matter
what it is, does it?

398
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,411
Only that you're here now.

399
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:14,388
But I saw you speaking to my mother.
You know about the bomb.

400
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,770
You know about everything.

401
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,996
You came here
because you needed to.

402
00:32:20,256 --> 00:32:23,504
You needed to hear the truth
before you could save the world.

403
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,318
I save the world?

404
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:29,258
You've had the power all along, Peter.

405
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,723
You just needed to learn how to use it.

406
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:33,005
Why me?

407
00:32:33,506 --> 00:32:36,507
Because there has to be one that's good.
There always has.

408
00:32:37,254 --> 00:32:40,494
And your heart has the ability
to love unconditionally.

409
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:42,693
Like I told you.

410
00:32:43,193 --> 00:32:46,936
In the end, all that
really matters... is love.

411
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,632
I'm tired now.

412
00:32:58,053 --> 00:32:59,981
Let's get you your rest then, sir.

413
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:02,571
Call me Charles.

414
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:11,750
Wake up, wake up!

415
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:18,655
I must've blacked out.

416
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:22,087
How did you find me?

417
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:24,484
I told you.
We have a tracking system.

418
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:26,578
And where's Claire?

419
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:28,298
She's safe.
She's with your mother.

420
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:29,641
- My mother?
- Yeah.

421
00:33:29,815 --> 00:33:31,749
They're on their way
out of the city right now.

422
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:33,828
Then you need to leave too.

423
00:33:34,215 --> 00:33:37,225
- I don't think I can control this.
- No, I'm staying with you.

424
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,917
You saved
my daughter's life.

425
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,711
I told you
I owed you for that.

426
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:43,926
Consider this payback.

427
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:48,341
Yeah, but if I can't stop Sylar,
if I lose it, I could...

428
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:51,269
I'll put you down myself.

429
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:57,703
Don't worry.
I'm a pretty good shot.

430
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:00,673
Thank you, Mr. Bennet.

431
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:03,268
Call me Noah.

432
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:07,979
Come on.

433
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,981
The guards are coming.

434
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:15,392
Dad!

435
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:19,767
We have to go.

436
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:28,036
It won't work.

437
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:29,388
Yes, it will.

438
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:33,923
Come on!

439
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:48,866
It doesn't look like
there's many places to hide.

440
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:51,592
- You sure about this tracking system?
- He's here. Don't worry.

441
00:34:54,204 --> 00:34:57,447
Look, all right, then that means
he's hiding in plain sight.

442
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:10,095
What took you so long?

443
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:19,059
Haven't I killed you before?

444
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:20,544
Didn't take.

445
00:35:27,856 --> 00:35:29,781
You think I'm gonna
let you ruin it all?

446
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:31,733
Take all the glory?

447
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,336
Did you really think
you could stop me?

448
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:10,300
Mom, Dad needs your help!

449
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:13,335
Go back to your family.
I've got this.

450
00:36:37,354 --> 00:36:38,387
Wait, no!

451
00:36:41,956 --> 00:36:43,787
Turns out you're the villain, Peter.

452
00:36:46,577 --> 00:36:47,638
I'm the hero.

453
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:54,232
You.

454
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:13,671
You can stop this.

455
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,232
How?

456
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:17,389
I need you to kill me.

457
00:38:34,391 --> 00:38:35,391
Do it.

458
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:41,669
Do it. You're the only one Claire!

459
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:44,245
Tell me there's
another way, please.

460
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:47,008
Shoot me.
There is no other way.

461
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:53,200
Yes, there is, Claire.

462
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:03,270
The future isn't written in stone.

463
00:39:05,195 --> 00:39:06,575
I took his power, Nathan.

464
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:09,522
I can't control it.

465
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:11,014
I can't do anything.

466
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:14,883
I'm not leaving you, Peter.

467
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:18,536
There's another way
to end this, and you know it.

468
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,762
I can't let you die.

469
00:39:21,586 --> 00:39:23,164
And I can't let everyone else.

470
00:39:30,337 --> 00:39:31,810
You saved the cheerleader...

471
00:39:33,585 --> 00:39:35,103
so we could save the world.

472
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:41,024
I love you, Nathan.

473
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,712
I love you too.

474
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:47,274
You ready?

475
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,760
What happened to them?

476
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:01,648
Wait!

477
00:41:05,274 --> 00:41:07,126
Please don't die, Officer Parkman.

478
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:09,398
You're my hero.

479
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:16,533
<i>We dream of hope.
We dream of change.</i>

480
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:20,218
<i>Of fire, of love, of death.</i>

481
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:23,421
<i>And then it happens.</i>

482
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:25,898
<i>The dream becomes real.</i>

483
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,456
<i>And the answer to this quest,</i>

484
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:33,205
<i>this need to solve life's mysteries
finally shows itself.</i>

485
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:36,209
<i>Like the glowing light of a new dawn.</i>

486
00:41:41,828 --> 00:41:42,929
Let's go home.

487
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:47,296
Home where?
Our house burned down.

488
00:41:48,646 --> 00:41:50,751
Home is anywhere
our family is together.

489
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:54,336
You've got a plan, right?

490
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:12,096
<i>So much struggle for meaning,
for purpose.</i>

491
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:16,355
<i>And in the end,
we find it only in each other.</i>

492
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,561
<i>Our shared experience of the fantastic.</i>

493
00:42:21,086 --> 00:42:22,086
<i>And the mundane.</i>

494
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,163
<i>The simple human need
to find a kindred.</i>

495
00:42:30,596 --> 00:42:31,704
<i>To connect.</i>

496
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:33,807
<i>And to know in our hearts...</i>

497
00:42:36,714 --> 00:42:38,386
<i>that we are not alone.</i>
