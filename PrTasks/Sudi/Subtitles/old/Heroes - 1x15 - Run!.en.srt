1
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,061
Sword not there!
Original owned by man named Linderman.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,277
He's a client of mine.

3
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:16,389
Get your car,
you're going back to Vegas.

4
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:18,212
You're going home.

5
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:20,739
The charges against you
have been dropped, Miss Sanders.

6
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:22,901
And as far as Linderman is concerned?

7
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:25,383
Don't worry
about tomorrow's problems today.

8
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:28,823
Officer Parkman,
we're enforcing a six-month suspension.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,637
We're gonna need
your gun and your badge.

10
00:00:30,723 --> 00:00:32,874
Nothing in my life has been real.

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,347
My dad obviously doesn't work
in a paper factory.

12
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,758
He's gone now. You're okay.

13
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:41,343
This is my friend.
He's gonna make everything okay.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,808
Mom?

15
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:44,023
Claire?

16
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:46,679
I was hopping
you could tell me about my father.

17
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:48,539
That's... complicated.

18
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:50,295
He's kind of a big shot.

19
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:00,367
<i>You might not remember me.</i>

20
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:02,656
<i>We haven't spoken in a long time, but...</i>

21
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:04,238
<i>I just had...</i>

22
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:07,681
<i>Our daughter just found me.</i>

23
00:01:10,316 --> 00:01:12,052
<i>Did you hear what I just said?</i>

24
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:14,952
<i>She's alive.</i>

25
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:19,903
Meredith?

26
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,178
We need to talk.

27
00:01:27,164 --> 00:01:28,701
<i>Nathan, are you still there?</i>

28
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,285
It's been 14 years.

29
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:34,730
I went to your funeral.

30
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:37,188
Look, that fire--
it-- it wasn't an accident.

31
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:39,754
Someone was out to get me,
and the police,

32
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,892
they just assumed I was dead, so...

33
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:43,346
<i>I ran.</i>

34
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:46,045
And our daughter?

35
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:48,750
<i>She's got an angel on her shoulder,
that one.</i>

36
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:50,179
<i>She was adopted</i>

37
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:52,214
by a nice family here in Texas.

38
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:54,426
She's 16 now...

39
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,131
and she's beautiful.

40
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,888
She's got blond hair, like me,

41
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,528
<i>and she is smart, just like you.</i>

42
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,900
Maybe one day she'll run for Congress.

43
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:08,896
The timing of...

44
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:11,888
your call, two weeks before my election,

45
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:13,769
that's not a coincidence, is it?

46
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:17,201
A child born out of wedlock,
that's big news.

47
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:19,065
You wouldn't want that to come out.

48
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:20,554
<i>Ruin things for you.</i>

49
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,554
How much do you want?

50
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,631
<i>$100,000?</i>

51
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:37,421
That oughta cover it.

52
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,959
<i>I'll let you know where to send it.</i>

53
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,864
Nice and easy.

54
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:54,981
Mom, are you okay?

55
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:56,917
I've been better.

56
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,015
She'll be fine.

57
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:00,036
Just needs a little rest.

58
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:01,744
A little time to recover.

59
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:03,229
Recover from what?

60
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:07,622
She had an appointment
with a neurologist, who ran some tests.

61
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:08,906
What kind of tests?

62
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,408
Your mother's
been having some headaches.

63
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:16,266
Yeah, she's also been having some
memory loss. Did you tell them that?

64
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:18,135
Of course, Claire.

65
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:22,582
I'm handling it.

66
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,736
Don't worry, honey, I'll be fine.

67
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,540
Mr. Muggles isn't worried, is he?

68
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:45,702
No, he's not.

69
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:02,272
D.L. won't be fooled.

70
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:03,478
Sure he will.

71
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:06,798
Love is blind,
and if last night is any indication,

72
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:09,725
he won't be able
to see anything for a long time.

73
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:14,098
Nik, baby, I gotta get going.

74
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:15,674
I'll be right there.

75
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:21,980
You look all Secret Service.

76
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:24,495
Is this standard issue for bodyguards?

77
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:26,928
Bodyguards? We're not called
"bodyguards" anymore, honey.

78
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,101
It's "private security."

79
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:30,781
Whatever you want to call it,
it's paying the bills.

80
00:04:31,632 --> 00:04:33,310
Are we ever gonna talk about it?

81
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,490
Talk about what?

82
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,042
What we can do.

83
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,043
Our powers.

84
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:42,199
I just feel like we're supposed
to be fighting crime or something.

85
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:43,641
That's true.

86
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:46,666
But for now, can you just have fun
at school, my young genius?

87
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:48,313
Yep.

88
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,793
All right. Baby, there's a package
for you over on the table.

89
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:55,923
Thanks.

90
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,161
Are you taking your gun?

91
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:12,640
It's the difference
between $500 and $350 a day:

92
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,787
my carry permit.

93
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,701
You're not gonna need it, alright?

94
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:19,467
I'm basically a glorified babysitter.

95
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:20,820
Nothing's gonna happen.

96
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:21,871
I hope not.

97
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,463
Thank God you called.

98
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:26,605
Playing house is making me cranky.

99
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:31,140
I understand. The guy stole his money,
he wants him dead.

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,030
What Mr. Linderman wants,

101
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:34,268
Mr. Linderman gets.

102
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:42,964
I'm Malsky.

103
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:46,414
Matt Parkman.
Here to protect you, sir.

104

transcript: swsub.com synchro: Sixe

105
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,161
Excuse me.

106
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,277
Are you okay, miss?

107
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,463
Anything we can do to help?

108
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,701
No, I couldn't possibly...

109
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,250
We're complete strangers.

110
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:18,012
I'm Ando.

111
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,600
This is my friend, Hiro.

112
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:21,449
Hi.

113
00:07:21,992 --> 00:07:22,992
I'm Hope.

114
00:07:28,504 --> 00:07:29,504
So...

115
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:31,939
Where are we headed?

116
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:34,063
Diamond District.
Broadway and 6th.

117
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:37,332
What a beautiful day
to be in Los Angeles.

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,370
Look at this weather. And the air?

119
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:40,624
What's your name again?

120
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,415
Uh, Parkman. Matt Parkman.

121
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:44,608
Listen, Parkman.
The job is simple.

122
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,061
You drive me downtown,
we meet a man, I make a deal,

123
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:50,018
then you drive me back to the airport.

124
00:07:50,107 --> 00:07:52,133
You just make sure no one bothers me.

125
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:54,286
That includes you.

126
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,504
<i>Hope this loser knows
how to use his gun.</i>

127
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,332
<i>Otherwise, we're both dead.</i>

128
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:10,552
My name's Dr. Mohinder Suresh.

129
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,596
It's very important
that I speak with him.

130
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,978
I assure you, my interest is legitimate.

131
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,935
My name is Dr. Mohinder Suresh.

132
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:21,720
It's really rather complicated
to explain over...

133
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:23,069
This is Dr. Mohinder Suresh.

134
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,767
A certain genetic trai..

135
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,737
Have you noticed
anything unusual about his behavior?

136
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:29,101
My name is Dr. Mohinder Suresh.

137
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,413
Are you still there?

138
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,061
<i>One new message.</i>

139
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,783
<i>Hi. This is, Zane.</i>

140
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,183
<i>Zane Taylor. Z- A-N-E Taylor.</i>

141
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,257
<i>I, uh...</i>

142
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:47,242
<i>I got your phone message, and...</i>

143
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:52,030
<i>Something is happening to me.
I can't control it. I...</i>

144
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,779
<i>I think we need to talk. Please hurry.
Can you come see me</i>

145
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,962
<i>right away? It's really--</i>

146
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:03,984
<i>Five minutes, ladies. Five minutes.</i>

147
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:06,185
We've dated for a few months...

148
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,285
He lives in L.A., comes to visit

149
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,607
and at first,
he was really sweet, but...

150
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,270
now he's... just horrible.

151
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:14,877
He even hit me once.

152
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,833
Your boyfriend did this to you?

153
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:22,114
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,605
I left this morning
while he was sleeping

155
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,270
but I forgot my bag.
It's--

156
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:29,293
It's pink and it has rhinestones on it.

157
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,396
It's got all my money
and my credit cards

158
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:33,576
and it even has my family photos in it

159
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:35,360
that I can't replace.

160
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:39,813
I should go up there and talk to him.

161
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:41,864
Maybe he won't be so mad.

162
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,149
No!

163
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:44,895
We will do it.

164
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,118
Excuse us, please.

165
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:23,765
Hang on.

166
00:10:23,843 --> 00:10:26,293
Did you two
say something about Mr. Linderman?

167
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,192
Yes. You know him?

168
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,616
Well, not personally,
but everybody knows who he is.

169
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:32,069
I know people who do.

170
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,218
That's great.

171
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:37,421
If we get your bag,

172
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,220
can you introduce us?

173
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:40,820
Yeah, I can do that.

174
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,342
We still have a problem.

175
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,938
How do we get past security?

176
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:48,206
I have an idea.

177
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:59,349
- Who's there?
- Room service.

178
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,443
I didn't order room service.

179
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,605
Complimentary for high roller.

180
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,171
Very nice room.

181
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:22,008
How are you today?

182
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:33,534
You're done.

183
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,068
Please hurry.

184
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:50,647
Oh, God.

185
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:51,847
Hurry...

186
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,006
Please hurry.

187
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:06,645
Dr. Suresh?

188
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:11,774
Yes.

189
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,292
Yes.

190
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:18,654
Thank God. Man, come in.

191
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:22,702
Come in.

192
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:30,430
I was starting to think
you weren't going to show.

193
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,260
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

194
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:34,360
I mean, look at what I'm living with.

195
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:35,835
Yes, I see what you mean.

196
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,268
I'm just a regular guy.

197
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:38,332
I mean...

198
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:39,891
I've never been different

199
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:41,868
or-- or special, or-- I mean,

200
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:44,549
No one would even look at me twice
walking down the street.

201
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,465
I guess I should show you.

202
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,790
Right?

203
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:54,578
What I do, you need to see it, right?

204
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Yes, of course.

205
00:14:57,874 --> 00:14:59,566
I haven't left the apartment

206
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,324
for three weeks.

207
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:03,142
I'm going a little crazy.

208
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:09,145
Maybe you should step back.

209
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:11,514
It can get a little messy.

210
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:22,576
We reap what we sow, Nathan.

211
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:25,349
You have no one to blame but yourself.

212
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:27,982
I'll go down to Texas and handle it.

213
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:29,461
So close to the election?

214
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:30,893
Don't be ridiculous.

215
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,879
If the press gets wind of this,
especially on the heels

216
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,261
of the Linderman scandal--

217
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:36,838
I cared about Meredith once.

218
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:40,814
I owe her more than a phone call.
I owe them both.

219
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Besides,

220
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,758
I'm this girl's father, come on.

221
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:46,610
You're a glorified sperm donor,

222
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:48,480
don't get emotionally attached.

223
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:52,037
How can you be so cold?

224
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,357
Because I know you, Nathan.

225
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:56,106
Beneath the gruff exterior,
you're a sap.

226
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:59,472
The moment that young girl looks at you
with her sad little weepy eyes,

227
00:15:59,473 --> 00:16:01,178
you're lost, you're finished.

228
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:04,714
You'll start giving, and she'll start
taking until there's nothing left.

229
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,320
So prioritize, Nathan.

230
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:09,924
Wire the money to Texas.

231
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:12,982
Focus on the people who really matter.

232
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:27,222
How's Mom?

233
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,814
Your mother's resting.

234
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:33,526
So I understand you and Zach
cut school yesterday.

235
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,769
Mom said we could.

236
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:36,954
It was for our report.

237
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:39,562
We went to the aquarium.

238
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:41,766
With these tickets?

239
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,810
Printed from your computer? These...

240
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:46,383
fake tickets, Claire?

241
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:48,173
You're spying on me?

242
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:50,958
I don't know where you were,
and I don't wanna know.

243
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:53,666
You're a teenager,
you need to assert your independence

244
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,915
but this behavior...

245
00:16:57,574 --> 00:16:58,704
It's unacceptable.

246
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:00,651
You're grounded, young lady.

247
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:04,410
You're to be home every day
at 5:00 sharp until further notice.

248
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:07,751
What? You can't do that!
You have no right.

249
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,044
I'm your father.

250
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:10,613
You're not my real father.

251
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:15,195
No, I'm not.

252
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:17,803
But I'm as close as you've got,

253
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,558
so you'll stay home at night.

254
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,568
Until you earn our trust back.

255
00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:29,823
Hi.

256
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,319
It's me, Claire.

257
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,070
<i>Do you have a second to talk
about my father?</i>

258
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,278
Oh, hey, Claire. I'm glad you called.

259
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:38,400
<i>Talk about coincidence.
I found your father.</i>

260
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:43,111
You're kidding. What'd he say?

261
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:45,550
Well, after he got over the shock

262
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:47,042
that we were both alive,

263
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,714
he was actually kinda sweet.

264
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:51,651
Said he'd be happy to help us out.
Sounded real generous, too.

265
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:53,908
<i>Says he's gonna fly right down
from New York.</i>

266
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,720
Well, I want to meet him.

267
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:00,390
Right. Well,I don't know about that.

268
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,178
But he's my father.

269
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:04,016
Right. Well, um...

270
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:08,593
Why don't I talk to him,
and we'll see what he says.

271
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:12,889
<i>You know what? I actually have to go.
But, I'll call you later, all right?</i>

272
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:15,699
I love you.

273
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:46,104
I've got the money.

274
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:47,753
Let's see the diamonds.

275
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,948
Stones range from 2 to 9 carats.

276
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,411
My offer is more than generous.

277
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,556
<i>Not that it matters.</i>

278
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:04,858
<i>Linderman's guy... will be here soon.</i>

279
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,917
<i>You won't get out alive.</i>

280
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:12,415
Sir, please. Please.

281
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:14,242
We have gotta get out of here right now.

282
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:15,322
This is a setup.

283
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:19,284
- What-- how do you know that?
- I just do. You have to trust me.

284
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:26,491
You've got a deal.

285
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,132
I gotta run.

286
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:36,633
Who's Linderman?

287
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,706
My ex-employer.
How do you know his name?

288
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:39,707
Never mind that.

289
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,563
Why has he sent someone
here to kill you?

290
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:43,387
<i>Because I stole his $2 million.</i>

291
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:45,855
<i>Should've been out of the country
by now.</i>

292
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:47,729
Great. You stole the money.

293
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,087
How do you know?

294
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:53,169
Wait a second.

295
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:55,098
You gotta get me out of here.

296
00:19:58,651 --> 00:19:59,651
Take this.

297
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,777
There's another one for you
when you get me out.

298
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:02,858
You can't bribe me!

299
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:04,132
I don't want to die.

300
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:05,579
<i>Two in the bodyguard,</i>

301
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,942
<i>then Malsky gets one in the guts.</i>

302
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:10,284
<i>Two in the bodyguard,</i>

303
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:12,400
<i>then Malsky gets one in the gut.</i>

304
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:17,653
She's in there.

305
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:38,913
This should be fun.

306
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:47,907
I do all the work,
he takes half the profit?

307
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,075
I'm sick of it.

308
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:52,176
No, I got these two Chinese guys
to help me out.

309
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:54,942
Turned on the waterworks an
they were mine.

310
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:56,344
Yep...

311
00:20:56,728 --> 00:20:58,483
They're getting the suitcase
as we speak.

312
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:00,784
All right.

313
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,491
I'll catch the bus from Primm
and meet you in Barstow.

314
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:05,703
I love you too, Leon.

315
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:10,971
Oh, hi!

316
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:12,841
I didn't see you come in.

317
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,161
You were on telephone.

318
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:17,711
With my mom.

319
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:19,761
So, um... Where's the bag?

320
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:23,621
We are not Chinese. We are Japanese.

321
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,491
Whatever.

322
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:28,351
Where's...

323
00:21:28,774 --> 00:21:29,777
the bag?

324
00:21:32,902 --> 00:21:34,580
You are a bad person.

325
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:36,792
You may have fooled Ando,

326
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:38,477
but you do not fool me.

327
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:40,433
Thanks for the help, Sulu.

328
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,621
What are you doing?

329
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:53,618
We can't stop here. Keep moving.

330
00:21:58,412 --> 00:22:01,132
All right, this way, this way!
Come on! Come on!

331
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,859
Okay... Go to the elevator.

332
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,197
You can't do this.

333
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:20,526
You have to stop!

334
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:21,987
Don't worry, Niki.

335
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:25,073
I don't plan on being
Little Miss Homemaker forever.

336
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,539
Just gotta lay low for a while.

337
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:33,117
You're chasing two men with a gun
in broad daylight.

338
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:35,026
You call that laying low?

339
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:37,308
This is my life.

340
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:39,107
My child!

341
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:40,793
You can't do this!

342
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:41,916
I have to.

343
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:44,320
Somebody's gotta repay Linderman.

344
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:48,438
You made the deal
to get me out of jail?

345
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,827
I couldn't leave it up
to you now, could I?

346
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:57,527
The elevator's not coming.

347
00:22:57,565 --> 00:22:59,018
- Who are you calling?
- Backup.

348
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:00,995
You can't bring the cops into this!

349
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:02,520
Terry, hey! It's Parkman.

350
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:05,882
I'm working security--
Diamond District, 6th and Broadway.

351
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:08,805
I got a shooter, possibly two.
Send everyone you got.

352
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:17,442
Come on!

353
00:23:29,717 --> 00:23:31,414
You go to
the other side of the building.

354
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:33,445
Cops will be here soon.
I'll buy us some time.

355
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:08,169
Drop your weapon.

356
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,966
Over the side,
right now.

357
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:25,832
OK, where's your partner?

358
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:28,746
- Partner?
- Come on-- Your partner!

359
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:31,359
I heard you arguing with her.
Niki, right? Where is she?

360
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:35,655
You heard Niki?

361
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:38,169
Where is she?

362
00:24:40,374 --> 00:24:42,067
She's probably killing Malsky...

363
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:44,027
right now.

364
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:08,708
<i>Fourth one over, third one back.</i>

365
00:25:08,746 --> 00:25:11,283
<i>Fourth one over, third one back.</i>

366
00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:18,652
Hey, there you are.
Come on, let's go!

367
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:20,767
Me again.

368
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:32,408
No! Don't!

369
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:34,668
What are you doing here?

370
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:37,016
I have to see my father.

371
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:40,343
You don't understand.

372
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:44,245
I'll wait here all night if I have to.

373
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:50,042
Why don't we take a walk?

374
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:52,521
It's my mom...
She's sick.

375
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:53,716
I think it's bad.

376
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,389
Oh, I'm so sorry.

377
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:56,533
How can I help?

378
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,396
You said my father had money.

379
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,191
You said he had power
and that he wanted to help us.

380
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:04,352
- I thought maybe he could--
- Honey--

381
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:06,775
I didn't mean that kind of help.

382
00:27:06,836 --> 00:27:08,167
I mean just money.

383
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,871
I don't understand.

384
00:27:16,513 --> 00:27:17,924
Your daddy--
He's...

385
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:21,381
How do I explain this?
He's...

386
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:27,448
When your daddy found out
that I was pregnant with you...

387
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,057
What I'm trying to say
is that you can't count on him.

388
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,492
He'll give us cash because that's easy.

389
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:40,140
But anything else,
he'll just disappoint you.

390
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:50,290
He doesn't even want to meet me?

391
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:52,804
Oh, Claire...

392
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:54,744
Please.

393
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:58,562
Why'd you even tell me about him?

394
00:28:00,874 --> 00:28:02,947
Because he wants to give us some money.

395
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,819
$50,000, and you're entitled
to half of that.

396
00:28:10,194 --> 00:28:11,642
I don't want his money.

397
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,660
I'm heading back to Mexico for a while,

398
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,722
so we're probably
not gonna see each other.

399
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:25,294
I want you to take
real good care of yourself, OK?

400
00:28:35,085 --> 00:28:36,243
Hang on.

401
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:40,505
So I can remember that sweet face.

402
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,299
Police!
Get your hands up!

403
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:16,993
I'm on the--

404
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:18,453
I'm on the job.

405
00:29:23,704 --> 00:29:25,227
Hello.
Zane Taylor?

406
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:27,499
Yes.

407
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:29,658
You must be Dr. Suresh.
Come on in.

408
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,595
Can I get you some tea?

409
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,747
Sorry it took me so long to get here.

410
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:41,924
No, it's no problem.

411
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:43,365
Is Earl Grey okay?

412
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:45,907
Yes, that'll be fine.

413
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:51,275
You...

414
00:29:51,775 --> 00:29:53,892
sounded rather alarmed on the phone.

415
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:56,704
You seemed to have calmed down some.

416
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:01,048
I had a kind of epiphany
about it this morning.

417
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:06,322
Are you familiar with Abraham Maslow,
the peak experience?

418
00:30:06,947 --> 00:30:07,947
I'm afraid not.

419
00:30:08,555 --> 00:30:09,555
It's...

420
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,064
a single moment
that takes you out of yourself.

421
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,653
Makes you feel very tiny or very large.

422
00:30:16,737 --> 00:30:20,326
To some extent,
one with life or nature or God.

423
00:30:21,368 --> 00:30:22,368
I see...

424
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:26,383
Like seeing all the pieces
of a puzzle fit together.

425
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:31,911
All this time,
I was... trying to fight it.

426
00:30:33,037 --> 00:30:34,037
Deny it.

427
00:30:35,139 --> 00:30:36,431
But there is no shame

428
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,290
in having this ability, is there?

429
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,548
None whatsoever.

430
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,039
It would be like denying
you have brown eyes.

431
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:43,197
Right.

432
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:45,608
So...

433
00:30:46,156 --> 00:30:48,453
I guess that you--
You want to see my ability.

434
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:51,574
Yes! I mean, I'm quite anxious
to document it.

435
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:03,934
You might want to step back.
That looks like a nice jacket.

436
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:19,611
My God!

437
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,134
You want to see it again?

438
00:31:55,654 --> 00:31:59,087
Look, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry for the way things turned out.

439
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,794
You know, I could've been a--

440
00:32:02,112 --> 00:32:04,624
A much better person... back then.

441
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:09,380
You politicians, you sure know
your way around an apology.

442
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:13,527
You and me,
we were never gonna work out.

443
00:32:15,787 --> 00:32:17,271
- Two diff--
- Different worlds.

444
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,538
I hope this goes a long way

445
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,046
toward making up
for the fact that I wasn't there.

446
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:35,182
For both of you.

447
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:41,923
So...

448
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:46,427
Where is she?

449
00:32:50,307 --> 00:32:51,638
You just missed her.

450
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:53,894
Did she want to see me?

451
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,766
I snapped a photo of her.

452
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:02,836
Look how beautiful she is.

453
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:06,049
I'm sure she is.

454
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,343
Take a look, Nathan.

455
00:33:15,674 --> 00:33:18,075
She came here with her bags all packed.

456
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:21,287
She thought you were gonna rescue her
from her tragic life.

457
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:24,238
That sound familiar?

458
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:31,919
I told her you're just here
to pay your money and go.

459
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:43,236
Did I speak out of turn?

460
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:46,502
I could call her.
I could get her to come back.

461
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:50,533
You did fine.

462
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:55,297
You did just fine.

463
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:08,711
I should probably be heading back
to my family.

464
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:48,919
Just the kids.

465
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:06,797
I'm very interested
in how you control this...

466
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:08,911
ability.

467
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:13,374
Well, it's, like...

468
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:16,378
Riding a bike for the first time.

469
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:19,806
It's a little wobbly.
And then I discovered something:

470
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:22,484
a kind of peace.

471
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,813
A sense of purpose
that can only be described as destiny.

472
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,633
I'd like to take a DNA sample.

473
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:38,126
From me, okay. Um, sure.

474
00:35:38,878 --> 00:35:42,128
Just swab it
on the inside of your mouth.

475
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:50,649
The tea.

476
00:35:50,952 --> 00:35:52,554
If you'll excuse me for a second.

477
00:35:52,555 --> 00:35:53,555
Of course.

478
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:02,877
I just swab it
on the inside of my cheek?

479
00:36:03,021 --> 00:36:04,079
Yes, that's right.

480
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:25,770
There you go.

481
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:27,361
DNA sample.

482
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:29,078
Thank you.

483
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:31,369
You know...

484
00:36:31,776 --> 00:36:34,543
You should be careful who you talk to
about this ability, Zane.

485
00:36:35,432 --> 00:36:38,079
There's some people
who might not understand.

486
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,686
Who might want to hurt you.

487
00:36:39,724 --> 00:36:41,631
Why would anybody want to hurt me?

488
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:42,984
I don't know yet.

489
00:36:43,138 --> 00:36:44,314
But I do know this--

490
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:46,621
There are others out there like you.

491
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:47,870
Really?

492
00:36:48,796 --> 00:36:50,848
- How many others?
- Dozens.

493
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:52,616
And those are just the ones
I know about.

494
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:53,958
With more time and research,

495
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:55,859
I could find hundreds, thousands!

496
00:36:58,612 --> 00:36:59,612
But, uh...

497
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,131
You're the first one
who's return my phone calls.

498
00:37:02,564 --> 00:37:04,975
But I am going to find them.
All of them.

499
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:07,847
I could go with you.

500
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,282
I could help you. Think about it.

501
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:13,224
These people could need convincing.

502
00:37:14,203 --> 00:37:15,680
Who better to do that?

503
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,128
Ando, over here!

504
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,269
Hope!

505
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:37,224
You got it.
My hero.

506
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:40,312
I was trapped under a bed.
Your boyfriend is very large.

507
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,790
You mean ex-boyfriend.

508
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:44,850
Come on. I need a ride to Primm.
My mom's house.

509
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,449
I'm sure she would love to meet you.

510
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,501
Where's Hiro?

511
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:50,278
Oh, I took him to meet the guy

512
00:37:50,316 --> 00:37:52,419
who could introduce him
to Mr. Linderman.

513
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:53,782
He didn't wait for me?

514
00:37:54,187 --> 00:37:56,020
He said he didn't
really need you anymore.

515
00:37:56,572 --> 00:37:59,486
But I didn't even give you your bag yet.

516
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:01,145
Why didn't you wait for me--

517
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,989
Three's a crowd, baby.

518
00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:10,549
We gotta go.

519
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,228
You're not Ando.

520
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,195
S. R. Gustavson,
State Gaming Commission.

521
00:38:52,304 --> 00:38:53,441
I come in peace.

522
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,767
I only saw the blonde--
Yes.

523
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:01,630
But I heard them talking.
I know there were two of them.

524
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:03,643
I'm telling you,
she was incredibly strong.

525
00:39:03,644 --> 00:39:05,329
She broke my handcuffs.

526
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,012
Any idea where the diamonds are?

527
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,800
You didn't find the case?

528
00:39:11,134 --> 00:39:14,455
I guess the incredibly strong killer
and her partner must've taken it.

529
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:36,688
Fourth one over, third one back.

530
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,785
Fourth one over, third one--

531
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:57,003
<i>What a joke.</i>

532
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,777
<i>Parkman. What a joke.</i>

533
00:39:59,072 --> 00:40:02,641
<i>Can't even do a decent job
as a rent-a-cop.</i>

534
00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:06,107
<i>He'll never wear a police badge
again in his life.</i>

535
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:37,366
You okay?

536
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,528
Yeah, I'm good.

537
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,001
Mom, I'm home!

538
00:40:57,436 --> 00:40:59,020
<i>To survive in this world,</i>

00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:02,064
<i>we hold close to us those people
on whom we depend.</i>

540
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:06,152
<i>We trust in them
our hopes, our fears.</i>

541
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:09,788
Go away, you!

542
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:13,951
Mom, what's going on?

543
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:16,651
This mangy thing
came at me out of nowhere.

544
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:17,964
I think it has rabies.

545
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:19,651
Go away! Scat !

546
00:41:21,871 --> 00:41:24,390
Mom, this is your dog, Mr. Muggles.

547
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,585
You love him.

548
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:28,410
I don't have a dog.

549
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:32,336
I don't know any Mr. Muggles...

550
00:41:33,483 --> 00:41:34,834
and I don't know you.

551
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:46,497
<i>But what happens when trust is lost?</i>

552
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,721
<i>Where do we run
when things we believe in</i>

553
00:41:49,722 --> 00:41:51,659
<i>vanish before our eyes?</i>

554
00:41:59,457 --> 00:42:00,536
It's done.

555
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:08,007
Micah, did I get another package?

556
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:10,254
Yeah, it's in your bedroom.

557
00:42:10,624 --> 00:42:11,624
Thanks.

558
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:13,094
I'm opening it now.

559
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:17,925
<i>When all seems lost,
the future unknowable,</i>

560
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:20,604
<i>our very existence in peril...</i>

561
00:42:21,184 --> 00:42:22,713
Yeah, I remember him.

562
00:42:27,308 --> 00:42:28,406
Not a problem.

563
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:30,025
Consider it done.

564
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,369
<i>... all we can do... is run.</i>
