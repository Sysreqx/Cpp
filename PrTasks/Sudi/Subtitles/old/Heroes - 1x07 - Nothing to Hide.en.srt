Chapter Seven - Nothing to Hide

2
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,592
M-Core's holding steady,
but Yamagato

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,010
Yamagato is down

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,262
to 215 and an 1/8.

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,765
- I think that's a good bargain.
- Oh, really?

6
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,475
And what do you know?

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,229
- You saying I couldn't pick a stock?
- Ah, Darwinian.

8
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,064
Look at your sorry ass.

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,441
Barely able to
make minimum wage.

10
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:25,940
Now you look at me

11
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:28,271
living in a penthouse.

12
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:30,861
- Central Park West.
- Correction.

13
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:34,280
It's dying in a penthouse
in Central Park West.

14
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:40,622
Right you are, my boy.

15
00:00:41,087 --> 00:00:42,500
Right you are.

16
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:45,670
Teach you to mess with me.
Take a breath.

17
00:00:46,508 --> 00:00:49,002
In the end,
all that matters is love.

18
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:53,802
I love you, Peter.

19
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:56,640
I love you too, Charles.

20
00:00:57,305 --> 00:00:59,101
You speak your mind.

21
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:01,550
You know who you are.
You know what you want.

22
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:02,721
That's your power.

23
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:04,690
That's your strength.

24
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,392
Mind if I let you in on
a little secret, Charles?

25
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:09,502
You can say anything to me,
you know that.

26
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,453
I can fly.

27
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:19,411
Really?

28
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,200
Well, if you can fly,
then show me.

29
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:27,330
All right.

30
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,130
Watch this.

31
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:06,583
Simone.

32
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,463
What's wrong? Come in.

33
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:16,721
It's my dad.

34
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:19,221
That's so weird. I was

35
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:21,262
just having a dream about him.

36
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:24,392
He passed away
about an hour ago.

37
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,903
I really needed to see you.

38
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:43,631
You know,
I get that you're sort of socially slow,

39
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,220
but you know you're supposed to
call someone before you come over.

40
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:47,762
This you're gonna want
to hear right away.

41
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:50,120
- I found the tape.
- What tape?

42
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:53,510
The tape of you trying to kill
yourself 20 times. I found it.

43
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:56,991
Look, I was looking for my PSP under
my bed, right? And there it was.

44
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:58,262
You're safe.

45
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:01,542
I thought this was
supposed to be good news.

46
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,772
Well, I can't believe you
had it this entire time!

47
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:05,323
- Why didn't you look there before?
- I did.

48
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:06,892
I tore the whole room apart.

49
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,183
I must've checked the bed,
like, 50 times.

50
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,692
Good morning, Mrs. Bennet.

51
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:14,311
Good morning, dog.

52
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:16,691
How are you, Zachary?

53
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:19,740
I'm all right.
Claire keeps punching me, though.

54
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:24,460
Your dad's plane's gonna be late.
I won't be home until 8:00 or so.

55
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,303
I am trusting you to
hold down the fort.

56
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:28,332
Because Lyle never
listens to me.

57
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:30,180
Well, he will
listen to you today

58
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:32,913
because he knows what a big
day it is for Mr. Muggles.

59
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:35,371
Thank you.
And he doesn't want to stress us out.

60
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,053
- Whew, does he?
- Sure.

61
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:40,801
Will you two help
me out to the car?

62
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:43,762
Your dad left on the
sprinklers last night.

63
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,602
And I don't want to
get his paws all soggy.

64
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:48,813
Here we go.

65
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,392
Wish Mr. Muggles good luck.

66
00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:22,511
Micah?

67
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:25,891
Micah?

68
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:29,101
Micah!

69
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,451
Help me.

70
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:04,481
Now, things have been
really good between us

71
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:06,512
these last couple days.
Don't you think?

72
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,602
I know. I like it.

73
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,662
I just... I feel like we've been
really honest with each other.

74
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:17,063
- And that's good, right?
- Yeah.

75
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,900
There's something that
we need to talk about.

76
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,690
Something that I discovered.

77
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:25,823
I thought I'd been so careful.

78
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,530
Well, what?

79
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,951
What is it?

80
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:31,202
I don't...

81
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:33,331
Oh, God, he knows.

82
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:38,712
What?

83
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:40,542
What did you want to say?

84
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:44,522
It can wait, actually.

85
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,181
I gotta...

86
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:47,890
I gotta get to work.

87
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:49,640
Matt.

88
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:07,530
Niki?

89
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,410
I was knocking, like, forever.

90
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,333
What is it?

91
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,250
Micah.

92
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,963
Theo came back.

93
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,923
He... He took him.

94
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:27,303
I tried to protect my son.

95
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:29,842
But I couldn't.

96
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:33,762
I failed him.

97
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:44,192
Landlord said Isaac's gone.

98
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,112
He took his paintings and...

99
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:50,990
Did  you know he was leaving?

100
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:53,241
No.

101
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,080
I can't believe he
would just go like that.

102
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:01,063
I thought we were just starting
to make sense of his paintings.

103
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:04,343
I wanted to tell him
what happened in person.

104
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:12,553
Isaac sketched it for
my dad's 70th birthday.

105
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:15,451
You know, I've been trying
to get him clean forever.

106
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,601
The one time I need him.

107
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:20,233
Feels like everybody's
leaving me.

108
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:23,062
I'm not going anywhere.

109
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:26,280
He was still in a coma.

110
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,530
And then,
like it was any other day,

111
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:30,030
he  started talking.

112
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,570
He said he'd been flying
all over the world.

113
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,922
But that it was a world
he didn't recognize.

114
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,053
There was so many people
filled with pain.

115
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:40,030
Nobody looking out
for each other.

116
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:41,540
He worried for them.

117
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:43,710
And for me.

118
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:49,130
Until you told him
everything would be okay.

119
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:53,360
- What do you mean I told him?
- I know. It doesn't make any sense.

120
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:55,190
But he said that you
were flying with him.

121
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:57,321
And you told him it
was all gonna be okay.

122
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:59,162
That there were
people who cared.

123
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,852
Who would make a difference.

124
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,062
That you would save the world.

125
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,032
After that,
he just put his head down and...

126
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:10,193
He was gone.

127
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:12,912
Like he was falling asleep.

128
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:15,870
I never had that conversation
with your father.

129
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,262
But it sounds like
something you would say.

130
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,703
Those messages you left
on my answering machine.

131
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:24,960
You said you wanted one
of Isaac's paintings.

132
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,712
Because it would help
you save the world.

133
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,422
It's hard to explain.

134
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,722
But if you had that painting...

135
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:41,733
I could save the world.

136
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:44,313
Linderman.

137
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:46,940
What?

138
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,612
The painting you want.

139
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:51,491
I sold it to a guy
named Linderman.

140
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:53,783
He lives in Las Vegas.

141
00:08:57,498 --> 00:09:02,373
Linderman gave you $4 million,
and you're spending it on postcards.

142
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,502
- I take it I'm supposed to choose.
- Mmm.

143
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:13,550
- That one.
- Well, that isn't a red flag.

144
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:15,381
You two agreeing on something.

145
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:17,901
All right, gonna go to the
office and have this printed up.

146
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,810
Don't you want to
hear about how

147
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,641
the New York Journal wants
to do a cover story on you?

148
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:26,483
I've invited Oliver Dennison
to come for family brunch

149
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:28,612
- and do an interview.
- You're kidding.

150
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:30,820
No, I never kid
about family brunch.

151
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:32,910
That's because we never
have family brunch.

152
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,651
Nathan, this could be great.

153
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,363
I don't know.

154
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,663
Dennison could go
anywhere for a bagel.

155
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,552
He comes here,
he's gonna want something.

156
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:43,281
Nothing wrong with taking
advantage of an opportunity.

157
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,292
Mandy...

158
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:49,390
Kids, why don't you go finish that train
set we started this morning, all right?

159
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:50,791
Take  them upstairs.

160
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:56,801
- I am not gonna use my family for political gain.
- Tell that to Peter.

161
00:09:57,385 --> 00:10:00,431
Nathan, you've been trying to
protect me since this happened.

162
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:03,562
It's sweet in theory,
but in practice, it's insulting.

163
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,892
- I'm not made of glass.
- I know.

164
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:09,150
But we don't need this.

165
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:13,943
Four points behind says we do.

166
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:17,021
I've been hiding in this
house for the last six months

167
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:19,781
because your polling was
afraid I'd make you look weak.

168
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:23,040
But now I can help
by coming forward.

169
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,242
Let me.

170
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:28,333
You sure about this?

171
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:31,293
Set it up.

172
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:33,461
Chef's been cooking
all morning.

173
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,262
Oliver will be here in an hour.

174
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,011
- Then I better get ready.
- Yeah.

175
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,190
Good idea.

176
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,373
Feeling okay, Matt?

177
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:02,993
Hey, Tommy.

178
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,281
Yeah, I'm, uh...

179
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,581
I'm good.

180
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:08,840
Come on, buddy. We rode in the
same car together for three years.

181
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,673
I can practically
read your mind.

182
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,950
Dude, I don't know
where to start.

183
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:16,882
How about we go get a beer?

184
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:20,262
- Dodger game at 7:00.
- Yeah.

185
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:22,343
Yeah, I like that. Thanks.

186
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:25,012
Hey, lady!
Would you look at that!

187
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:28,700
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

188
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:30,560
Sylar, he's killed again.

189
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,493
I'll brief you on the
way to the morgue.

190
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,812
Sylar? Who's Sylar?

191
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:36,291
- I gotta talk to my watch commander.
- Taken care of.

192
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:37,780
I'll be outside.

193
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,070
Put on some real
person clothes.

194
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,780
Lyle, you better not think
I'm cleaning up after you.

195
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:46,781
We just got rid of
all those ants.

196
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,201
Such a dork.

197
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,633
Okay, I'm good.

198
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,552
Oh, my...

199
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,263
Oh, my God!

200
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,523
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God! Claire!

201
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:02,800
Shut it off!

202
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:05,433
Lyle, give it to me!

203
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:06,510
Give it to me!

204
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:11,810
Claire!

205
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:21,581
It's amazing what you can do with
special effects these days, huh?

206
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,492
That was all special effects?

207
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:25,953
Yeah, what else would it be?

208
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:33,170
Ow!

209
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:36,670
What the hell is
wrong with you?

210
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:57,190
Lyle, give it to me! Lyle!

211
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,153
Lyle, get back here!

212
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,740
Lyle! Don't let him get away!

213
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:05,203
Lyle!

214
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:07,742
Lyle!

215
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,202
Get back here!

216
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:10,872
Hey!

217
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,892
Why would you want
to kill him again?

218
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:20,552
Because he found the tape
and then he stapled me.

219
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:23,340
Help! Somebody help me!
My sister's a freak!

220
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:27,221
Found him in a parking
lot in Brentwood.

221
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:28,602
Name's Robert Fresco,

222
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:31,060
an oncologist at
UCLA medical center.

223
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:33,813
Okay, so we figure out the M.O.

224
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:35,642
Well, the M.O.
is there is no M.O.

225
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:37,230
Sylar's victims are random.

226
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,862
Eight deaths I have no
clue how to explain.

227
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:42,720
Trust me.
This one's number nine.

228
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,543
Yeah, but there's nothing out
of the ordinary here, right?

229
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:46,463
Doesn't this guy look like
any other burn victim?

230
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:48,701
He's putting out 1800
curies of radiation.

231
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,833
Hazmat teams scoured the scene
but didn't find any incendiaries.

232
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:55,251
No plutonium,
no uranium... Nothing.

233
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:57,340
They did however
find a fingerprint.

234
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,630
Seared to the bone
like a brand.

235
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,593
Seared to the bone?

236
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,671
We're running it through CODIS.

237
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:06,313
Now, if we get a match and
we can get close to him,

238
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:08,311
I'm gonna need you to
get inside his head.

239
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:10,113
Pick him out of a crowd,
find him in a building...

240
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:11,563
Right, about that, um...

241
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:13,742
Lately  it's been harder for
me to filter the voices.

242
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:15,022
And

243
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:17,263
hearing what they're
really thinking...

244
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:19,151
It can be ugly.

245
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:21,481
What's going on, Matt?

246
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:31,583
Theodore Sprague. AKA Sylar.

247
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:33,121
We got you.

248
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:39,630
So you're just gonna sit there
all day and not say a word, huh?

249
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:41,503
I want to go home.

250
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:44,140
Like I told you,
it's not safe there with your mother.

251
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,341
- Is she dead?
- No.

252
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:50,721
- She's gonna be fine.
- How do you know?

253
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,893
- Dad, we left her on the floor.
- We didn't have a choice.

254
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:56,522
Heroes don't run away.

255
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,813
- Micah...
- Bad guys do.

256
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:00,901
Heroes help people, Dad.

257
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,320
You know what?

258
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:06,821
- You're a bad guy.
- I'm not a bad guy, all right?

259
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,241
Do you remember when
I told you that

260
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:13,491
six months ago I started
having these bad dreams?

261
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,661
We all have bad dreams, Niki.

262
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:18,121
I don't think that
they were just dreams.

263
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:23,460
When they started,
I thought that...

264
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,632
Maybe somebody was
following me or something.

265
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:32,723
And I would catch
my reflection.

266
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:37,600
But it wasn't my reflection.

267
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:45,271
It was another me.

268
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,652
She has a name.

269
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,413
- Jessica.
- Jessica?

270
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:55,950
When  someone tries to hurt me,

271
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,203
it's like she comes out.

272
00:15:58,205 --> 00:15:59,791
There is no Jessica.

273
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:01,623
It's just you.

274
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:04,252
No, I see her in the mirror.

275
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:07,803
And she tells me that she
wants to come out again.

276
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:12,223
The part of me that
needs Micah back

277
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:16,263
wants to let her do it.

278
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,100
It's just complicated
with your mom and me.

279
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:22,691
What's up ahead?

280
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,822
Stay there.

281
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,451
Dad, don't!

282
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:41,912
Get out! Quick!

283
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:49,383
What has happened?

284
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,681
He'll never get
her out in time.

285
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:59,432
Lady, you gotta get up!

286
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,061
You gotta get out of there.

287
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:15,862
You no worry. I help.

288
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:24,962
- Dad!
- Hiro!

289
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,751
Why couldn't I have
super strength too?

290
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:27,312
Dad!

291
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:30,151
Micah!

292
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,741
Dad...

293
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,121
I thought you were dead.
What happened?

294
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:46,330
I don't know.

295
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:01,300
We're usually in our pajamas
around the breakfast table.

296
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:03,861
You can't blame us for
cleaning up for the Journal.

297
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:05,972
Not when the hollandaise
is made fresh.

298
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:11,902
- You seem to be adjusting well.
- To the wheelchair?

299
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,983
You can say it, Mr. Dennison.

300
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:17,030
I lost my right to be sensitive
when I married Nathan.

301
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:21,743
I'm not saying I didn't have my
darker moments during rehabilitation.

302
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,783
I was angry for a long time.

303
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,952
At your husband?

304
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,960
- Wasn't he driving?
- At God.

305
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:35,503
But we seem to have
made our peace.

306
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:43,433
Oh, hello, Peter.

307
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:48,060
- What's this?
- It's brunch.

308
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:51,652
- We always have brunch.
- Since when?

309
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:53,312
Will you excuse me?

310
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:57,402
Peter, how good to see you.

311
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,822
Nice of you to drop by, Peter.

312
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:03,780
Whatever this is about,

313
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:05,871
now is not the time.

314
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,202
Charles Deveaux
died this morning.

315
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,581
I'm sorry.

316
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:12,582
- Were you there?
- No, I wasn't.

317
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:15,013
I stopped working for him so I could
figure out what was going on with us.

318
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:17,100
I told you to drop all
this "I'm special" crap.

319
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:18,891
I can't, all right?
I need your help.

320
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,772
That man out there
is Oliver Dennison.

321
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,903
He's working for the
Journal doing a story on me.

322
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:24,983
Everything I've worked for is
riding on our family being able

323
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,072
to sit through a single
meal together and smile.

324
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:29,931
- So I'm not family enough for you now.
- No, you're not.

325
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:32,772
Not when you're gonna
ruin an election for me.

326
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:37,482
I need you to get me a painting,
all right? Linderman bought it.

327
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:38,901
Whoa, whoa...

328
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,460
We're not exactly advertising that
family connection around here.

329
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:45,130
All right, great. So just get him on
the phone and ask about the painting.

330
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:47,283
Peter,  I'm sorry.

331
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,453
But you're gonna
have to go, okay?

332
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:50,751
Hey, you know what?

333
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:52,762
I'm just gonna fly
off the terrace, yeah?

334
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:55,080
No? Hey, I can fly.

335
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:56,792
Nathan, so can you.

336
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:58,381
I'll tell you what.

337
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,062
Why don't we just race around the
Statue of Liberty real quick, huh?

338
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:03,390
Give this tweedy guy
something to write about.

339
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:07,353
- You wouldn't.
- Ah?

340
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:11,642
Peter.

341
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:13,941
Peter.

342
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:17,313
Sorry,

343
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,283
Nathan gave me an earful
about showing up in cords.

344
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,400
I told him I'm trying
to stay grounded.

345
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:27,992
Good to have you back.

346
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:32,373
How'd you get this?
The issue isn't even out yet.

347
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:34,641
I got it in the future.
It's a story about me.

348
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:35,712
Hiro.

349
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,173
Um, see...

350
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,500
All the same.

351
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:39,882
Hiro...

352
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:43,552
Even same car! Nissan Versa!

353
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:46,342
I teleported.
New York City. Yataa!

354
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:48,143
I freeze time too.

355
00:21:48,438 --> 00:21:50,471
Stop the explosion.
Saved your dad!

356
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,190
- Hey, didn't you visit my mom?
- Hmm?

357
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,983
We should get them to a hospital.
Can you drive?

358
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:01,152
Don't worry. Help is coming.
I call the police.

359
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:02,781
Time to go, Micah.

360
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:05,653
Dad, you saved her.
Like a real hero.

361
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:08,031
Now we can go back
and save Mom.

362
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:09,870
I wish it were that easy.

363
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,042
Well, it is, Dad.
We just go back.

364
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:13,750
No, Micah...

365
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,960
It's not.

366
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,752
I'm sorry. We can't go back.

367
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:22,632
We can never go back.

368
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:27,550
Come on.

369
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:40,272
- Bye-bye!
- Take care!

370
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,493
Come on,
you can't stay in there forever!

371
00:22:56,298 --> 00:22:58,582
Then just give me
the damn tape.

372
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:01,643
I'm gonna put this thing on YouTube.
Make, like, a million bucks.

373
00:23:01,676 --> 00:23:04,803
- YouTube's free, you idiot.
- You're not helping.

374
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:08,971
Lyle, no one can see
what's on that tape.

375
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:11,851
Are you an alien or something?
Is he an alien too?

376
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:14,931
Yeah, yeah. We're gonna...
We're gonna anal probe you!

377
00:23:15,148 --> 00:23:17,681
Zach! Stop scaring him.

378
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:20,201
I'm not coming out until
Mom and Dad get home.

379
00:23:20,236 --> 00:23:23,573
No, no, no.
You cannot tell them.

380
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:25,692
Lyle, please.

381
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,990
- They cannot find out about this.
- Why not?

382
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,953
Don't you get it?
If they found out,

383
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:36,452
Mom and Dad would think it was
a mistake to ever adopt me.

384
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:41,000
We wouldn't be a
family anymore.

385
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:50,092
Please.

386
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,272
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

387
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:09,532
Argh!

388
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:13,531
Wait a minute.

389
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:16,662
Wait a second.
We're going in here without backup?

390
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,890
No one even knows we're here,
do they?

391
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,003
What is this all
about with you?

392
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:23,211
You in my head, Parkman?

393
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:25,841
No, I'm just...
I'm asking a question.

394
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,803
It's about Sylar.

395
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,082
I'm not letting him
get away this time.

396
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,972
I'm taking him down.

397
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:44,862
Something's burning.

398
00:24:45,406 --> 00:24:48,532
- Radiation?
- Curie levels are safe.

399
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,781
What the hell is this?

400
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:57,490
What...

401
00:24:58,048 --> 00:25:00,082
Hang on,
I'm getting some spikes.

402
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:07,293
Hey.

403
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,130
Check this out.

404
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:18,683
Their faces are all burned off.

405
00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:54,341
What the hell happened in here?

406
00:25:55,598 --> 00:25:58,301
1800 curies of radiation.

407
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:00,392
Come on, let's get out of here.

408
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,650
Of course I'm gonna
vote for Nathan.

409
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:10,023
If Nathan

410
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,430
takes care of the people

411
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:14,113
half as much as he takes
care of his brother,

412
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,111
it's gonna be an
interesting city.

413
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:19,990
- Pretty special family.
- You have no idea.

414
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:23,411
This is all very inspiring.

415
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:28,080
I was surprised to learn the Linderman
Group recently invested in
your campaign.

416
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,723
I don't know why
you'd be surprised.

417
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:31,681
Mr. Linderman was a good
friend of my father's.

418
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:35,111
So you don't deny going to Las Vegas
to meet with a reputed mobster.

419
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:39,473
Is that why you're here?

420
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,363
I spoke with a former member
of your security detail.

421
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:44,193
It seems there was
a bit of a scare.

422
00:26:44,525 --> 00:26:48,563
You disappeared from the
casino for several hours.

423
00:26:48,948 --> 00:26:51,153
And there was a
blonde involved.

424
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,451
It's all right, Nathan.

425
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:02,913
You can tell him.

426
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:07,503
- Right, um...
- Look, um...

427
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,372
I'm sure that you've

428
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:12,593
recently heard about my
mental health issues.

429
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,673
I quit my job because of it.

430
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,890
My brother basically
saved my life.

431
00:27:20,185 --> 00:27:22,930
And he's convinced me to
get the help that I needed.

432
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:28,022
There's a private
clinic outside Vegas.

433
00:27:28,237 --> 00:27:29,520
Nathan went,

434
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,481
spoke to a doctor...
A woman doctor.

435
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:36,361
I made him promise that
no one would know.

436
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:37,743
Not even the family.

437
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:39,742
But I just don't

438
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:44,332
care who knows anymore. Okay?

439
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:48,253
I didn't want to say anything
until I cleared it with you.

440
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:51,380
That's Nathan.

441
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:53,643
You know,
right in the middle of an election,

442
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:56,712
he still has time to help out
his messed-up little brother.

443
00:27:56,888 --> 00:27:58,223
Oh, well...

444
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:03,800
What's this?

445
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:06,730
- They counteract radiation poisoning.
- Oh, thanks.

446
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:09,103
One second.

447
00:28:11,946 --> 00:28:13,313
Who keeps calling you?

448
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:16,570
Uh, nobody. It's my wife.

449
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,441
Since when is your wife nobody?

450
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:20,503
Listen, I don't think
this guy's Sylar.

451
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:22,610
Yeah? Well, we'll see.

452
00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:24,523
Look what I found
in the bedroom.

453
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,161
Look at this. Methotrexate.

454
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:28,250
This is chemotherapy in a pill.

455
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:31,462
This is prescribed to Karen
Sprague and it's current.

456
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,331
- She has cancer?
- Check out the doctor on the label.

457
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:36,593
- Dr. Robert Fresco...
- Right.

458
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,303
- The oncologist.
- Mmh.

459
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:40,173
Karen Sprague's room?

460
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,351
Take it easy, Ted.

461
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,550
We just want to ask
you some questions.

462
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:56,443
I didn't mean to kill him.

463
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,900
Dr. Fresco said there was
nothing he could do to save her.

464
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:01,890
I tried to convince him,
you know?

465
00:29:02,118 --> 00:29:04,661
There must be something
else that he could do.

466
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,993
Anything.

467
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,333
And we argued.

468
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,082
And I lost control.

469
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:13,293
We can talk about
this downtown.

470
00:29:15,508 --> 00:29:18,172
- Hey, let her go.
- If you let me stay with my wife.

471
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,961
No, you let her go or I shoot.

472
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:21,851
Do you have any idea what
would happen if you did that?

473
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,681
Because I don't.
Maybe I'll explode.

474
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:25,483
Maybe I'll take out
this whole hospital.

475
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:27,852
Maybll wipe out this city
like an atomic bomb.

476
00:29:27,895 --> 00:29:29,942
- Just leave me alone!
- We can't do that!

477
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:31,600
Stop, Teddy, stop!

478
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:37,903
Karen wants you to stop.

479
00:29:38,158 --> 00:29:41,033
- How could you say that?
- She says you need to listen.

480
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:43,950
Ted, you never listen.
You're too damn stubborn.

481
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,990
But you're still
her teddy bear.

482
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:48,381
Gimme a break.
You think you can hear her?

483
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:51,661
He's telling the truth, Ted.
Listen to him.

484
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:02,923
What's she saying?

485
00:30:05,435 --> 00:30:07,012
She's saying she...

486
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:10,931
She doesn't blame you...

487
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:14,182
For all the pain and the worry.

488
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:18,482
She's saying it's
not your fault, Ted.

489
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:21,151
She shouldn't be here.

490
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:23,193
It's not fair.

491
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:25,073
She's saying it never is.

492
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:27,573
She said that was
the best date.

493
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:31,200
The picnic on the beach.
And it poured sheets and sheets of rain.

494
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,041
We sat in my car...

495
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:37,793
And listened to the whole
American Beauty album.

496
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,633
She remembers it all.

497
00:30:41,218 --> 00:30:42,883
She always will.

498
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:51,893
What's she saying now?

499
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:17,080
Hi, this is Niki
Sanders from Las Vegas.

500
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:19,332
I need your help.

501
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:23,463
I know that I'm probably the last
person that you want to talk to.

502
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,881
You should not have
called me here.

503
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,013
I know that I have no right to.

504
00:31:28,346 --> 00:31:30,302
But I need your help.

505
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:34,641
My husband took my son.

506
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,890
I have nowhere else to go.

507
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:40,100
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

508
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,568
You have the wrong number.

509
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,360
- Hi, Hon.
- Hi.

510
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:47,573
- Where are the boys?
- In the play room.

511
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:53,240
- Do you still love me, Nathan?
- Of course I do.

512
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:57,830
I know what this chair
means to us as a couple.

513
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:01,501
But I need you to know that
I'm going to walk again.

514
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,251
The doctors say
it's a long shot.

515
00:32:04,886 --> 00:32:08,220
But I can do it if
I have a reason.

516
00:32:09,175 --> 00:32:11,472
We just need some hope, Nathan,

517
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:13,800
that our life can
be like it was.

518
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:19,691
What Peter said

519
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:24,360
about you checking out a
clinic for him with a doctor.

520
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,441
Tell me that's what happened.

521
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,153
If you say it is...

522
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:32,611
I'll believe you.

523
00:32:33,956 --> 00:32:35,781
Just give me some hope.

524
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,161
It's true.

525
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:43,711
Come on.

526
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:50,423
- I'm gonna get the kids ready for bed.
- Okay.

527
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:03,942
What the hell happened?

528
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:08,862
You should just...
You should just go.

529
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:11,531
Niki, what is going on here?
Are you okay?

530
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:13,530
I said that you can go now.

531
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:15,623
It's me.

532
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:18,833
I'm just trying to help you out,
girl, okay?

533
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,740
She doesn't need
your help anymore.

534
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:22,963
Understand?

535
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,132
- Hey.
- Hey.

536
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,731
So they're gonna run Sprague
through decontamination.

537
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:35,151
And then put him in a special
holding tank downtown.

538
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,691
How'd he cause all that
damage with his bare hands?

539
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:40,061
How do you hear what
people are thinking?

540
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:44,022
You did a great job in there.

541
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,051
Well, the guy was
losing his wife.

542
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,650
He just wanted to talk to her,
say goodbye.

543
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:50,573
You talk to your own wife yet?

544
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:52,862
You've been dodging
her call all day.

545
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:57,823
Well, I'm gonna head downtown,

546
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,370
- cover Sprague's processing.
- Right.

547
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,843
Hey, it's me.

548
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,550
I actually thought you
might be home by now.

549
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,303
I'm calling just to...

550
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:20,971
talk, um...

551
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:25,440
Look, I had this stupid
idea in my head that...

552
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,350
that I'm losing you.

553
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:29,193
And I...

554
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,190
I just...

555
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,571
I can't help but have
the feeling that

556
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,901
there's something
you're not telling me.

557
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:39,582
And I don't want us to
live with any regret.

558
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,203
Or blame.

559
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:46,332
I don't know. I guess I'm just
afraid of things going unsaid.

560
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,633
I love you.

561
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,420
And...

562
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,010
And I just wanted
to tell you that.

563
00:34:56,515 --> 00:34:59,461
You don't have to call me back.
I'll see you later tonight.

564
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,021
Yes, Mr. Linderman.

565
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:13,401
It seems my brother's developed some
sort of emotional attachment to
this painting.

566
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:16,872
I don't know what'll happen
to him if he doesn't get it.

567
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,030
But I'd rather not find out.

568
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,070
Directly to the gallery.

569
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:25,451
Mr. Linderman, I appreciate it.

570
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:27,332
Good night.

571
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:40,681
You need to tell
Heidi the truth.

572
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:42,801
No.

573
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:46,520
She doesn't need the truth.
She needs hope.

574
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,031
- What, is that some kind of excuse?
- I'm not saying what I did was right.

575
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:53,111
That girl in Vegas...
I just needed to be with someone who...

576
00:35:53,578 --> 00:35:56,780
didn't make me feel guilty
every time I looked at her.

577
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:00,950
Did you...
Did you talk to Linderman?

578
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,202
- Yeah. Sit down.
- And?

579
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:09,581
He's not gonna let it go.

580
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:13,130
Hey, come on. Just let it go.

581
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:15,850
- It's just a painting.
- It's more than that, Nathan.

582
00:36:15,886 --> 00:36:17,481
This is about what's
going on with us.

583
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:18,672
All right, this...

584
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,683
This painting is the key.

585
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:24,183
With this thing,
we can make a difference.

586
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:27,363
I'm trying to make a difference,
Peter, the best way I know how.

587
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,151
Flying around,
how is that going to help anybody?

588
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,233
What is that gonna...

589
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:32,201
What am I gonna do
when I get there?

590
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:35,200
I don't have a gun. I don't have
a badge. I don't know karate.

591
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:39,700
I guess I could put on a costume and
fly around and pull cats out of trees.

592
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,782
How's that gonna
make a difference?

593
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,911
You're not gonna
know until you try.

594
00:36:45,457 --> 00:36:47,540
I'm sorry about the painting.

595
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:57,382
Listen, something else
happened in Vegas that I...

596
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,010
What?

597
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,262
These two guys,

598
00:37:01,477 --> 00:37:04,141
they tried to pull me out
of my hotel room. They did.

599
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,852
It was like a, um...

600
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,813
A kidnapping attempt
or something.

601
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:13,153
- How'd you get away?
- I flew.

602
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:16,941
- So who were they?
- The one who did all the talking

603
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:18,831
had these horn-rimmed glasses.
The other guy was

604
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:21,320
a spooky euro dude.
He didn't say a word.

605
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:24,243
Son of a bitch.
You really expect me to believe that?

606
00:37:25,538 --> 00:37:26,740
Yeah.

607
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,203
- I'm not lying to you.
- No?

608
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:30,793
No. Think about it.

609
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:33,723
What would people do if they
knew what we were capable of?

610
00:37:33,756 --> 00:37:36,460
They'd lock us up and
they'd throw away the key.

611
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:38,551
Now who sounds crazy?

612
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:40,801
Be careful.

613
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:43,051
Yeah.

614
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:06,411
Someone had a good day.

615
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,841
It's all over the station.

616
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:09,720
FBI bust,
Homeland Security collar...

617
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,508
- Congrats, buddy.
- Thanks, man.

618
00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:13,872
It really wasn't
anything, though.

619
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:15,501
It must've been something.

620
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:19,680
Your FBI girlfriend just put in a
request for you to retake the
detective's exam

621
00:38:19,718 --> 00:38:21,343
as a series of interviews.

622
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:24,272
- Can't blame it on the dyslexia this time.
- Wait a second...

623
00:38:24,307 --> 00:38:26,191
Interviews? I didn't even
know that was an option.

624
00:38:26,226 --> 00:38:27,973
She's FBI.
She pulled some strings.

625
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:30,852
And you are gonna pass it,
no problem.

626
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,100
Thanks, man.

627
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:34,771
Wow.

628
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,483
Loser.

629
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:41,360
I'm nailing you wife,
and she is so fine... So fine...

630
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:52,793
- Hey, you still want to grab that drink?
- Son of a bitch!

631
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:07,892
You do not choose your destiny.

632
00:39:08,186 --> 00:39:10,050
It chooses you.

633
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:14,183
And those who knew you before
fate took you by the hand

634
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,522
cannot understand the depth
of the changes inside.

635
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,963
- Yeah?
- Mom.

636
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,552
Micah.

637
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:48,973
Hey, baby, I've been worried.

638
00:39:49,266 --> 00:39:51,800
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

639
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:54,310
- Are you?
- I'm good.

640
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:57,231
Are you with your
dad right now?

641
00:39:57,485 --> 00:39:59,691
Uh, yeah.
I just got out for one minute.

642
00:39:59,987 --> 00:40:01,772
Mom...

643
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:06,491
- Mom, is this really you?
- Tell me where you are, baby.

644
00:40:07,786 --> 00:40:11,030
Just put my mom on the phone.

645
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,202
Your mom's not here right now.

646
00:40:13,456 --> 00:40:16,451
And she's not coming back until
I take care of a few things.

647
00:40:17,085 --> 00:40:18,931
So, why don't you tell
me where you are.

648
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:20,870
I'll come get you
and bring you home.

649
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,211
Your mom needs you.

650
00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:27,760
I'm in a little motel.
It's right off the Interstate 14.

651
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:29,931
It's called the
Littlefield Motel.

652
00:40:34,817 --> 00:40:36,311
You talking to your mom?

653
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:39,601
No. No,
I'm just goofing around.

654
00:40:44,028 --> 00:40:46,400
Come on.
We got some driving to do.

655
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:51,030
- They cannot fathom how much you stand to lose in failure.
- Micah?

656
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:54,952
But you are the instrument
of a flawless design.

657
00:40:55,498 --> 00:40:59,201
And all of life may
hang in the balance.

658
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,712
A hero learns quickly
who can comprehend

659
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:06,503
and who merely
stands in your way.

660
