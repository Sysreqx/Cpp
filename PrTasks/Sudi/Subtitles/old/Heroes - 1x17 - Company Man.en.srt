00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,753
Previously on "Heroes" --

2
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,516
I have no idea how
you're pulling this off

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,382
but I swear I won't stop 'til I
figure it out, you understand me?

4
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,688
I'm just trying to figure out
how to take take of our family.

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,428
I don't have a job, Jan.

6
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,517
They're going to pay
for what they did to me.

7
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,851
What they did to us.

8
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,103
There is no putting this
whole thing behind you.

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,564
We've got to find out what
they did and make them fix it.

10
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:24,820
You want to know why I was
invisible all of these years?

11
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:26,271
It was because of them --

12
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:29,651
and you drove the bastards
right to my door!

13
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:32,820
Claire, can you keep a secret?

14
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,911
I think I know how
I survived the fire.

15
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:41,293
Please say something.

16
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:49,882
Some family,
that's how I survived it.

17
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:52,130
Your mother has a
subdural hemorragy.

18
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:54,171
It's like a bruise
on the brain,

19
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:56,510
in the area that
controls memory.

20
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:59,850
- You erased her mind.
- It's ridiculous.

21
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:01,473
You tried to erase mine.

22
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:05,312
- What you know is dangerous.
- Why did you do this to Mom?

23
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:08,440
I only wanted to
protect my family.

24
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:48,442
- We've had enough of that.
- Don't, don't!

25
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,900
I'm not gonna nuke the dog.

26
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:55,530
It wouldn't hurt Mr.
Mugles, would I?

27
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,833
If you want to hurt this guy,
that would be the way to do it.

28
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,541
There are more pictures of dogs
around here than there are of kids.

29
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:04,750
You don't really think he's
stupid or sloppy enough

30
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,831
to leave incriminating
evidence around the house.

31
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,400
He did just get
raided by the F.B.I.

32
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:10,212
We couldn't get a
warrant for the house.

33
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:13,382
So maybe on the off-chance that

34
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:15,932
he's a little lil' sloppy or stupid,
I'm going to poke around.

35
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:17,270
So now we're jacking
his computer?

36
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:19,890
You want to sit around all day
and download files? I don't.

37
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,683
If we don't find
anything on his PC,

38
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,430
there is another place we can look,
inside his head.

39
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:26,480
I plan on that.

40
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,142
We're gonna bag the son of
a bitch at his factory,

41
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,982
see how he likes it.

42
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:43,122
- Maybe we can bag him here.
- Oh God, he's with his family.

43
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,293
Family's a pretty
good motivator.

44
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,540
I'm not taking any hostages.
We bag him at the paper factory.

45
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,791
That was plan A,
plan B is much better.

46
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:52,883
There is no plan B.
We leave now.

47
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:57,050
Are you going to let this guy
slip through your fingers again?

48
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,072
Lyle, help your mother.

49
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,701
Talk to me.

50
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:29,791
What's the point? Am I going
to remember this conversation?

51
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,081
Keep your voice down.

52
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:37,003
Lyle, take your mother,
get out of the house right now.

53
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:43,593
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.
We all do.

54
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,800
Honey -- what's happening?

55
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,561
Dad, what's happening?

56
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,062
Stay calm.

57
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:55,772
Yeah. Yeah,
let's just everyone, stay calm.

58
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:59,403
Ok? Everybody stays calm,
nobody gets hurt.

59
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:01,453
This is officer
Parkman of the LAPD.

60
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:04,031
Formerly of the LAPD.
Thanks to you.

61
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,450
What do you want from me?

62
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:07,201
You come into my
house with guns.

63
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:09,412
Not guns, gun.

64
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:12,043
I don't need a gun,
do I Mr. Bennet?

65
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,833
- Not after what you did to me.
- I don't know you.

66
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:18,842
If you insist on lying,
you're going to upset me.

67
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,761
And you know what
happens when I get upset,

68
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:24,222
I get very bright and very hot.

69
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:27,763
Ted is going to do us all a favour,
right, Ted?

70
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:30,852
And he's not going to get upset.
But you gotta help.

71
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,101
I'm not who you think I am,
I'm just a paper salesman.

72
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:39,901
No, no. You're not.

73
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:51,123
So tell me,
how do you feel about paper?

74
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:54,212
- Wildly enthusiastic.
- Good.

75
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,583
Because as far as friends
and family are concerned,

76
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,381
it's your
life. Congratulations.

77
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:02,712
You are the new regional
manager for Prima-tech paper.

78
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,511
Nice cover.
Sorry do make a liar out of you,

79
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,050
but it's part and
parcel of what we do.

80
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,390
Nobody outside the
organization knows.

81
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:14,392
They can't know.
People are fragile. Like teacups.

82
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:17,482
All around them,
the world is changing and they --

83
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:19,610
simply don't want
to deal with it.

84
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:22,361
They don't want to know what's
happening to us as a species.

85
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:24,072
And they certainly
don't want to know

86
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,490
the measures we take
to keep them safe.

87
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,242
Now you'll be
asked to do things

88
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:30,832
that fall in a moraly
grey territory.

89
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,450
Things that most
would find cruel.

90
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:37,463
But men like you and I,
know to be necessary.

91
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,921
I'm comfortable
with moraly grey.

92
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:43,922
Good, you'll have a partner,
one of them.

93
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,261
That's how we do it here,
keeps us all honest.

94
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:51,431
- Great, when do I meet him?
- He's already here.

95
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,353
Is this a test?

96
00:05:55,736 --> 00:06:02,401
How did you -- how did you --
how -- how is that?

97
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:05,282
It's a brave new world, friend.

98
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:14,662
Go ahead.
Tell them what you do.

99
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:18,170
What  goes on at that paper
factory of yours, Mr. Bennet.

100
00:06:18,257 --> 00:06:20,171
He abducts people.

101
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,380
He drugs us. 

102
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:28,303
He injects us with,
I don't know what.

103
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,013
I lost my job.

104
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:33,890
And I am trying not
to lose my wife.

105
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:35,642
You don't care about that,
do you?

106
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,430
You don't care about
what you did to me.

107
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:38,730
All you care about

108
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,773
is that we think that
nothing happened.

109
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:45,110
- Makes us forget.
- How can he make you forget?

110
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,612
The haitian.

111
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:53,411
-  That's right, thet haitian.
- She knows?

112
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,832
This is your fault.

113
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,833
She knows this is his fault.

114
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:04,192
He's got all them
fooled except for her.

115
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:10,222
Just when you thought plausible
deniability was gonna save your ass.

116
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,551
The haitian.

117
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,352
Your mother forget and your brother,
but not --

118
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:24,480
Why didn't he make you forget?

119
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:26,820
What is he talking
about, Claire?

120
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,862
I don't know anything.

121
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:31,742
You want to put a
stop to all this?

122
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,282
All you need to do to
keep your family safe,

123
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,211
to keep us all safe,
is just tell the truth.

124
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:41,873
- I am telling the truth.
- No. This is the truth.

125
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,290
Oh, my God.

126
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:48,592
This is what did you do me.

127
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:50,550
Settle down, Ted.

128
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:53,800
We just want to
be normal again.

129
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:59,811
He's not a paper salesman.

130
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:05,732
I guess she's not daddy's
little girl any more.

132
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:34,053
What are they doing?

133
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:35,513
Claire?

134
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,012
He's getting inside
your daughter's head.

135
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:41,560
I can run, get some help.
They can't hurt me.

136
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,983
Are you thinking about
being a hero? Don't.

137
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,731
Don't, this guy is serious
and he's really dangerous.

138
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:48,990
And I need your help to make
sure that nobody gets hurt.

139
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,570
You can read my mind.

140
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:55,703
- Yeah, your dad did it to me.
- It didn't just happen?

141
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:58,283
I wouldn't be here
if it just happened.

142
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:02,332
Has my dad done this
to other people?

143
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,960
As far ask I can tell,
it's different with everyone.

144
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,171
I've seen some weird things.

145
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:10,801
I'm sure you have, too.
Like the stuff at your school.

146
00:09:11,513 --> 00:09:12,920
Peter Petrelli.

147
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,090
Peter Petrelli?

148
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:21,522
He can do what I can do.
What do you know about him?

149
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,232
He can do what I can do.

150
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:28,561
He's different. Like you.

151
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:31,023
Save the cheerleader?

152
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:33,902
I read his mind, he read mine.

153
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,031
He told me to protect you.

154
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:39,912
From someone who was
killing people like me.

155
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:43,792
Are you different, Claire?

156
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,842
Your blood was all
over that crime scene.

157
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,762
You didn't have
a scratch on you.

158
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,970
Why didn't you have
a scratch on you?

159
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,221
I  can heal.

160
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:10,361
Did my dad make me this way?

161
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,121
What are they going
to do with the baby?

162
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,241
I don't know.

163
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:24,662
I wander if they knew
about little orphan Annie

164
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:27,460
before they sent us over there
to bag a bloody fire-starter.

165
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:30,630
Nah, they would have told us.

166
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:41,930
A word, please.

167
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:52,313
*No sign of the mother?

168
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,942
*We think she died in the fire.

169
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,651
*Your son?

170
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,740
*I understand you
have no children.

171
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,121
*That's correct.

172
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,042
*Having children changes a man.

173
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:06,540
*I can only imagine.

174
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:09,371
*You don't have to imagine.

175
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,502
*You're going to...

176
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,210
*adopt the baby as your own.

177
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,343
*I don't think
that's a good idea.

178
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,553
*It's not a request.

179
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:21,593
*You and your wife have been
trying to conceive, yes?

180
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,680
*Unsuccessfully. And frankly,
I'm relieved.

181
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,270
*I don't think I'd be
a really good father.

182
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,683
*Once again,

183
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:30,810
*not a request.

184
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,403
*Don't get too close.

185
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:43,703
*You're only her surrogate father.
She belongs to us.

186
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:50,212
*If she manifests,
we'll take her.

187
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:53,582
*Of course.

188
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,732
*Happy Fathers Day.

189
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:17,233
Did you make me this way?

190
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:20,743
Is that why you adopted me?
Am I some sort of experiment?

191
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:23,613
- Don't talk to your father like that.
- He's not my father.

192
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:25,120
They have nothing
to do with this.

193
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:27,763
- He's the one who got them involved.
- No. We did you and me,

194
00:12:27,787 --> 00:12:29,722
when we didn't leave the
house when they came home.

195
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:31,803
No one's been hurt, what's he gonna do?
Go to the police?

196
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:33,150
We can get out of
here right now.

197
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:36,170
- We came for a cure.
- What if there isn't one?

198
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,633
I'll kill us all.

199
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:45,053
Just -- get inside his head.

200
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,180
Get some answers or we're all
gonna have a really bad day.

201
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:54,900
Son of a bitch is
thinking in Japanese.

202
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:58,070
Why are you thinking
in Japanese, huh?

203
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:01,533
We want answers. Who are you?

204
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,113
And what did you do to us?

205
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,622
- The safe in the bookcase.
- Ted, there's safe in the bookcase.

206
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:22,170
No!

207
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:29,643
Stop it!

208
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,012
Enough, we're done!

209
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,733
We're not done!
I'm calling your bluff.

210
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,982
Ted! Ted!

211
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:42,833
Put the gun down,
that's not going to help anybody.

212
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:44,663
He killed my wife,
it's only fair I kill his.

213
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:46,361
With his own gun too.

214
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:52,120
- Kind of poetic, don't you think?
- Tell him what he wants to know.

215
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:54,000
Come on,
he's willing to kill us all.

216
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:55,790
Leave her alone.
She didn't do anything!

217
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:56,683
Claire, sit down.

218
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:58,793
Shoot me if you're
going to shoot someone!

219
00:13:58,925 --> 00:13:59,633
No!

220
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:03,962
Parkman, you have to trust me,
shoot Claire.

221
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,971
I'm telling you,
someone's going to die.

222
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,473
Sorry, Mrs. Bennet.

223
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,053
Shoot Claire, now!
She can heal.

224
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:13,391
- Shoot me!
- You brought this on yourself.

225
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:14,021
No!

226
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:25,153
Claire! What did you do?

227
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:37,373
Claire! What did you do?

228
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:40,213
What did do you that for?

229
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:43,842
Get his trust.

230
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,260
Now he knows how far we'll go.

231
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:48,093
Right hook. Right hook coming.

232
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:51,472
You killed my little girl! 

233
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:53,811
You did.

234
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:56,772
No!

235
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:04,021
Tell me it's not true.

236
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:07,360
Tell me.

237
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:08,901
Don't leave her here.

238
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:10,610
Move Claire's body
before she heals.

239
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,782
They don't need to
see her like this.

240
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,583
We've got to move the body.

241
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:18,622
I  had no idea it was
going to go this far.

242
00:15:18,838 --> 00:15:20,830
Believe me,
he was going to kill your wife.

243
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:22,640
I actually heard him pull
the trigger in his mind.

244
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:23,920
Thank you for shooting first.

245
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:41,692
Oh my God!

246
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,191
- Where's Mom and Lyle?
- Downstairs.

247
00:15:46,326 --> 00:15:47,193
- Are they safe?
- No.

248
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:48,990
You made her indestructible?

249
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:51,610
I didn't make anyone.
You don't have all the facts straight

250
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:54,371
and I don't appreciate
you confusing my daughter.

251
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:56,493
The fact is you work
in some freak factory

252
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:57,871
where your ruin people's lives.

253
00:15:58,046 --> 00:16:00,040
You've been mislead,
Claire, I'll explain later.

254
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,753
But right now you have to do
exactly what I tell you to do.

255
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:07,342
- I'm going to the police.
- Don't make the same mistake I did.

256
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:09,302
Don't put your family at risk.

257
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:20,432
- Parkman?
- Yeah, coming!

258
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:24,902
The people I work for
don't know about you.

259
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,652
If they did,
you wouldn't be here right now.

260
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,213
They would have
taken you months ago

261
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:31,200
and we never would
have seen you again.

262
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:34,490
You say you want a normal life?

263
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,330
That's what I've
been fighting for.

264
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,951
He's telling the truth.

265
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:46,252
Hate me all you want but right now,
this has to be contained.

266
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,840
Which means you
have to stay put.

267
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:51,673
What, you want me to play dead?
I'm sorry, I'm not Mr. Mugles.

268
00:16:51,806 --> 00:16:53,970
That man downstairs can
generate a chain-reaction

269
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:56,683
which would be like dropping
a nuclear bomb on this house.

270
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:58,771
And  he'll do it too.
Come on, we have to go now.

271
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:00,640
Do what I say,
so nobody gets hurt.

272
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:01,641
- And you --
- Yes.

273
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:03,061
Do what I think.

274
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,361
Hey!

275
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:16,531
Enough!

276
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,871
We already got their attention.

277
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:24,520
We're not going to
find anything here.

278
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,023
What we want is at
the paper factory.

279
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:26,920
- Really?
- Yeah.

280
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,383
Did he tell you
that or think it?

281
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:33,473
We've got records of the abductions,
what they've done,

282
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,800
in exchange for his family's safety.
He'll get them.

283
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,260
I don't want
anybody else to die

284
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:39,761
because of what
I've done to you.

285
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:42,251
Do all the words coming out of
your mouth sound like lies?

286
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:44,981
He's not lying.
We'll have proof.

287
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:50,112
- No surprises at the factory?
- Just the truth.

288
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:52,152
I'll stay with the family.
You go.

289
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:56,822
No. I'll stay with the family.

290
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,370
I can do more damage here.

291
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:01,832
Whatever you say,
you're in control.

292
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:07,043
Sandra --
I'm gonna get us out of this.

293
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,632
It's 7 a.m.
If you're not back in an hour --

294
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,882
look for the mushroom cloud.

295
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:23,680
I think my wife
suspects something.

296
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:27,272
She went through my bag,
she found a gun and a sedation kit.

297
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:32,611
That's particularly stupid on your part.
Letting her find it.

298
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,362
The baby has been
keeping me up for days,

299
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:38,951
it was sloppy. She thinks I'm
some sort of a serial killer.

300
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,950
She's better off thinking you're a
serial killer than knowing the truth.

301
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,371
I don't know what to do.

302
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:47,252
Is that a new sensation
for you, Bennet.

303
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,672
Is my wife in danger?

304
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:54,761
If I said yes,
what would be your next move?

305
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:57,421
Would you pack up Sandra and
little Claire and make a run for?

306
00:18:57,635 --> 00:19:00,392
Or would you turn her over?

307
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:04,971
I'd do what I've always done,
what I'm told.

308
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:07,352
But you didn't answer the question --
is she in danger?

309
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:09,442
Relax.

310
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,361
Nothing's going to
happen to your wife,

311
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:13,733
because she's not going to
remember finding anything.

312
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:16,781
There's a boy,
we discovered in Haiti --

313
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:19,660
- He can make her forget?
- He's really something.

314
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,200
He's mute.

315
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:23,451
When we asked him to
describe his ability,

316
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,333
he drew a picture of himself,

317
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:28,660
pulling memories like little
grubworms out of someone's head.

318
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,753
I wanted to put it on
the front of my fridge.

319
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:33,842
When he's done,

320
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:38,720
make sure you thank him
for saving Sandra's life.

321
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:54,483
She's upstairs.

322
00:20:09,797 --> 00:20:12,170
We don't have time for this. 
In about 38 minutes,

323
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,653
Ted's going nuclear unless we
bring him back hard evidence.

324
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,961
The only thing we're bringing
back Ted is a tranquilizer.

325
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:20,722
He deserves to know the truth.

326
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,932
He doesn't want the truth.
He wants his wife back.

327
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,422
Short of that, he wants revenge

328
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:26,763
of the good,
old-fashioned biblical variety.

329
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:30,681
You said yourself, he'd already
pulled the trig anywhere his mind.

330
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,102
Ok.  So that's if for him.
What about me?

331
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,912
Are you going to
send me back to L.A.

332
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:36,871
with my wife and baby and
no idea this ever happened

333
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:39,071
so you can pretend to have
a happy family again?

334
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:40,441
I'm not sending you anywhere.

335
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,071
You're the only
one I can trust.

336
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:45,661
Look, here's the deal.
I'll be honest with you.

337
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:51,913
- You be honest with me.
- You just try lying to me.

338
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:53,250
I just signaled the haitian.

339
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:54,762
You said no one would
know we're here.

340
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,380
Until I needed them to.

341
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,073
Guess who found
out where I live?

342
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,951
What do you think we
should do with them?

343
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:31,160
And guess who found
out you can talk?

344
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:35,671
Who have you talking to?
Who else knows about Claire?

345
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:39,922
Just you and I.
But that will change.

346
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,843
She wasn't supposed to
remember any of this.

347
00:21:44,478 --> 00:21:46,343
I gave you
specific instructions.

348
00:21:46,476 --> 00:21:49,183
I answer to someone's whose
instructions supercede yours.

349
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:50,513
In this company?

350
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,683
In your daughter's life.

351
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:09,911
What's the mission?

352
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,082
Looking into a security breach,
that's all I know.

353
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:14,501
That's all they told me.

354
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:16,710
That's all they
told you to tell me

355
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,671
but what you know is
considerably more.

356
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:20,631
You're not as good
a liar as you think.

357
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,510
You're the security breach.

358
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,933
Is that what they're
calling me behind my back?

359
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:29,892
I was hoping for something
a bit more subtle.

360
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:32,722
You americans are
usually good for it.

361
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:34,102
Is it true?

362
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:37,772
- Are you hiding one of them?
- By "them" you mean people like me?

363
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,731
Is that what you're
accusing me of hiding?

364
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:42,771
Well, the short answer is yes.

365
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,991
You're compromising
what we're doing.

366
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:47,203
Sorry, I know we're
serving the greater good

367
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:50,452
but it's keeping
me up at night.

368
00:22:50,665 --> 00:22:52,623
Seeing as you're raising
one of us as you're own,

369
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:55,233
- I was hoping for more sympathy.
- Claire is not one of you.

370
00:22:55,257 --> 00:22:57,793
Not yet, but one day, maybe.

371
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,132
Don't tell me you
haven't thought about it.

372
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:03,503
If she is then I'll take her,
it's done.

373
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:05,010
Just like that?

374
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,551
Father of the year, you are.

375
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:08,631
- You know who I work for.
- So do I.

376
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:11,643
I was in your office when
they told you to kill me.

377
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,812
Then why did you
get in the car?

378
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:18,562
Evidently I think you're
a better man than they do.

379
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,623
Get out.

380
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,092
It's not the first time you've
been told to kill a man,

381
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:42,222
but is it the first time you've
been told to kill a friend?

382
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:45,750
Tell me who it is and we
can forget about the rest.

383
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:48,672
You're just going to do it.
You're just gonna off me like nothing?

384
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:51,843
It's not nothing.
We find these people.

385
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:53,851
That's what we do
and you buried one.

386
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:56,013
You acted against the
interests of the company.

387
00:23:56,187 --> 00:23:58,982
Did you ever stop to think
what the interests are?

388
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,352
Who is it?

389
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:04,901
What if it was Claire?

390
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:08,032
That's why you're so
distant from her.

391
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:10,990
You know you're
going to turn her in.

392
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:12,950
You're preparing for it.

393
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:14,950
You used to believe
in what we do.

394
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:16,912
I used to believe
in the Tooth Fairy.

395
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:19,542
We made a promise, both of us.

396
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,540
I will not haunt my own people.

397
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:24,331
This isn't who you are.
You have a choice --

398
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,601
Why couldn't you just --

399
00:25:00,255 --> 00:25:01,332
She's my daughter.

400
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:04,331
You can't be trusted to put her
safety in front of company interests.

401
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:05,681
I've been hiding
her for months.

402
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:07,893
That's the sort of thing that will
get you killed by someone like you.

403
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,552
We're running out of time

404
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:12,762
and we're not exactly
dealing with a patient man.

405
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:15,141
Look, it's in Claire's best
interests that we contain this

406
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:16,460
and we keep her off the radar.

407
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:18,403
- She could run.
- She's safer in plain sight.

408
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,190
Not at the moment.

409
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:22,273
No one is going to be safe unless
you give Ted what he wants.

410
00:25:57,476 --> 00:25:59,010
Claire?

411
00:25:59,105 --> 00:25:59,931
God!

412
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:01,771
Thank you.

413
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,950
You came back.

414
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:35,130
Go, run!

415
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:37,220
Get out of here.

416
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:40,140
Go to the back!

417
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,600
Claire!

418
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,352
Get out of here -- run!

419
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:47,350
Mom!

420
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,113
Go! Mom!

421
00:26:53,656 --> 00:26:54,902
Claire!

422
00:27:14,806 --> 00:27:17,973
- You should have run.
- I could never leave you.

423
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,931
Not after I just got you back.

424
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:28,641
I always thought
were you a miracle.

425
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:31,362
Didn't know how much
of one until now.

426
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:32,770
I'm not a miracle, mom.

427
00:27:32,906 --> 00:27:34,572
You were dead.

428
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:37,282
Any time someone
rises from the dead,

429
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,323
I'd say that's a miracle.

430
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,781
I don't know what I am.

431
00:27:43,337 --> 00:27:46,452
I don't know if God made me
this way or someone else.

432
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:49,790
- God didn't make us this way.
- God makes us all the way we are.

433
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,882
I walk throughout fire
and didn't get burned.

434
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:54,751
You were trying to tell me.

435
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:58,473
I was trying not to tell you.

436
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,341
All this forgetting...
why I was in the hospital.

437
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:02,913
You think your father
did that to me?

438
00:28:03,226 --> 00:28:04,262
I know he did.

439
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,313
He said he was trying
to protect us.

440
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:10,643
He's your father.

441
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:14,022
He is coming back to
get us out of this.

442
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:15,861
He's lied to you your
entire marriage.

443
00:28:16,118 --> 00:28:18,781
What makes you so sure
he'll keep this word now?

444
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,240
Faith.

445
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:24,783
What I've seen,
what I've witnessed.

446
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:31,923
I can't pretend it's same
world it was yesterday.

447
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,633
God gave you a second chance,

448
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:39,091
find it in your heart to
give your father one.

449
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:41,763
I'm curious about something.

450
00:28:42,936 --> 00:28:46,600
Did Parkman know when he shot
you that you wouldn't die?

451
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,931
- Did your dad tell him that?
- I don't know.

452
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,862
That explains why they were so chummy
when they came down the stairs.

453
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,362
What do you suppose
they're up to?

454
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:00,653
Guess I'll just ask him myself.

455
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:07,873
Am I still in control,
Mr. Bennett?

456
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:15,083
You're still in control, Ted.

457
00:29:17,596 --> 00:29:19,092
No tricks.

458
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:20,921
Just what you asked for.

459
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:21,763
The truth.

460
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,480
We have what we want, Ted.
We have the proof.

461
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:26,260
Then why the theatrics with
shooting a girl who can't die?

462
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:29,101
It's better than
shooting one that can.

463
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:31,270
We didn't come here
to hurt anyone.

464
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,711
If the people I work for found
out I've shown this to you,

465
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:37,730
they will kill me.
Since I'm risking my own life.

466
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:40,780
I would rather not
risk my family's.

467
00:29:43,496 --> 00:29:46,202
Do you want revenge or
do you want the truth?

468
00:29:46,456 --> 00:29:48,411
You can't have both.

469
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,332
I want the truth.

470
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:55,040
Then let them go.

471
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:01,050
Get them out of here.

472
00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:05,430
What is he doing here?

473
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:08,430
Just making sure my family's safe.
That's all.

474
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,861
You stay, they can go.

475
00:30:19,947 --> 00:30:20,231
Go on.

476
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:21,321
Dad.

477
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:23,743
Go.

478
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,203
Come on, Claire, let's go.

479
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:31,373
Come on, come on.

480
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:38,882
Mom, I called the police.

481
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,593
We didn't make you this way.

482
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:45,472
It took you three
months to identify you.

483
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,641
At the time you were giving off low
levels of radiation, you were harmless.

484
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:51,561
And you did nothing to stop it.

485
00:30:54,108 --> 00:30:57,772
There's no cure,
we can't change the way you are.

486
00:30:58,028 --> 00:31:00,403
The only choice is to kill you.

487
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:02,362
I wish you had.

488
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:06,283
It was my call.

489
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:07,953
You had a life.

490
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:09,620
Who was I to take it from you?

491
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:12,531
Because you let me go,
my wife is dead.

492
00:31:15,547 --> 00:31:16,831
I'm sorry.

493
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:18,253
So am I.

494
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:21,380
- No, don't!
- You son of a --

495
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:51,821
Stop it!

496
00:31:54,835 --> 00:31:55,952
I can't!

497
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:12,340
- We gotta get out of here!
- No!

498
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:26,282
- Dad.
- Claire?

499
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,531
- Where's my dad?
- He's --

500
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:51,180
Claire, don't!

501
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,313
- Dad!
- Get out!

502
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:03,443
Not without you!

503
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:06,403
Tranquilizer. Stay down!

504
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,370
I can't get close enough.

505
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:24,751
- Give it to me.
- No.

506
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,253
I'll be ok.

507
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,093
Get him out of here.

508
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:34,383
Go!

509
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:21,720
Claire!

510
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,003
It's a good thing you
called me when you did.

511
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,840
This sort of thing
isn't taken lightly.

512
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,842
You know well and good what
the policy is on hiding them.

513
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:35,961
I'm well aware.

514
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:39,513
It's a shame I have to
kill another partner.

515
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:41,721
Especially one so
useful to the cause.

516
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:43,723
Has he even located,
the haitian?

517
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:46,312
He must have figured
you would turn him in.

518
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:52,312
How long was he hiding Claire?

519
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:55,322
In plain sight, too.
You must feel like a fool.

520
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:59,363
I take it it's been months.
She trusted him over her own father.

521
00:35:59,495 --> 00:36:00,990
Surrogate father.

522
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,042
Now that we have him,
we'll keep him sedated.

523
00:36:11,257 --> 00:36:13,883
We'll find out what
gives him his spark.

524
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,092
And then?

525
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:17,843
What do you think?

526
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:40,992
He was very helpful.

527
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:44,703
Imagine working with someone
like Parkman by your side.

528
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,830
Knowing what everyone
around you is thinking.

529
00:36:48,705 --> 00:36:51,080
It could prove
quite resourceful.

530
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:53,002
Certainly keep
everybody honest.

531
00:36:54,468 --> 00:36:57,961
- Is she one of them?
- Very promising.

532
00:36:58,768 --> 00:37:01,343
She's going to help us
clean up the mess you made.

533
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:04,763
- We're done here?
- Just one more thing.

534
00:37:07,188 --> 00:37:10,390
When should we be
expecting Claire?

535
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:14,443
I'll bring her in now.

536
00:37:24,248 --> 00:37:26,620
- Where am I going?
- I don't know.

537
00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:29,913
Will I see you again?

538
00:37:33,215 --> 00:37:36,130
Mom? Lyle?

539
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:38,252
I don't know.

540
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:42,672
I wanted to protect you.

541
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:47,722
You're my dad.

542
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:52,981
I tried to be the
best dad I could.

543
00:37:55,276 --> 00:37:56,693
I know.

544
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:09,702
Let's see?

545
00:38:14,216 --> 00:38:16,923
- Those are grandpa glasses.
- Aouch.

546
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:20,753
Even though I am the same age my
father was when he needed glasses.

547
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,383
How about these, huh?

548
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,893
- What?
- Grandma glasses.

549
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,233
- Will I need glasses, too?
- I don't know.

550
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:40,400
Well, if you need them and grandpa
needed them. Won't I need them?

551
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:45,990
Your mother and
I were wondering

552
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:48,740
when we were going to
have this conversation.

553
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:54,082
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

554
00:38:54,758 --> 00:38:55,540
Tell me.

555
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,841
I'm not your biological father.

556
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,420
You're adopted.

557
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:07,430
- Who are my real parents?
- We are your real parents.

558
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:09,721
We don't know who your
biological parents are,

559
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:12,223
but we're your real family.

560
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,441
You can't be my real
family if I'm adopted.

561
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,651
Well what makes us real
isn't where you come from,

562
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:24,942
it's how much we love you.

563
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:26,822
And we love you you very much.

564
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:30,240
I love you very much.

565
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:34,041
You didn't grow
inside your mother.

566
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,081
You grew inside our hearts.

567
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:44,342
Claire, talk to me.

568
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,553
Try these on.

569
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:04,941
How do I look?

570
00:40:05,826 --> 00:40:08,113
Like my dad.

571
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:46,691
This is good-bye.

572
00:40:48,787 --> 00:40:52,871
You don't have to do this.

573
00:40:57,915 --> 00:41:01,582
- There's got to be another way.
- This is the best way.

574
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:04,293
There can't be any
doubt about your father.

575
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:08,511
Right here.

576
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:11,511
Two inches higher and I'm dead.

577
00:41:13,685 --> 00:41:15,603
Claire, turn around,
cover your ears.

578
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:41,293
- Dad.
- God.

579
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:49,250
Go deep.

580
00:41:49,385 --> 00:41:52,510
Take anything that
would lead them to her.

581
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:06,063
I love you, Dad.

582
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:19,241
I love you, Claire bear.

583
00:42:30,077 --> 00:42:35,240
