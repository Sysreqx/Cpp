1
00:00:00,626 --> 00:00:02,294
Previously on Heroes...

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,338
My dad lied to me
about my entire life.

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,049
My biological parents.
My ability.

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,737
You can't just hide
things like that.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,011
A 21-year-old woman was
killed in the explosion.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,847
Also killed in the fire was
her 18-month-old daughter.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,684
Hi, I'm looking for someone
related to Meredith Gordon.

8
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,145
- This is her.
- Mom?

9
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,563
Where are you taking us?

10
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:23,940
Tell your boss I'm on
very important mission.

11
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,021
I work for someone...

12
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:27,061
who has true power.

13
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,780
And wants you to stop.

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,322
Father?

15
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:35,072
It can take years to integrate
a multiple personality,

16
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:38,491
but if you let me,
I can help you.

17
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:41,703
What I am, you can't fix.

18
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,083
Who are you?
How can you see me?

19
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:46,010
I don't know,
I can just do what you can do.

20
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm the Invisible Man.
I'm Claude Rains.

21
00:00:47,758 --> 00:00:48,791
Now get away from me.

22
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,362
I found you.
I need you to help me.

23
00:00:50,557 --> 00:00:52,013
This entire city is in danger.

24
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:54,701
You seem pretty sure about that
pending apocalypse of yours.

25
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:57,221
How many people have
you taught before me?

26
00:00:58,307 --> 00:01:01,851
If he crashes,
you bring him back.

27
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:04,350
Again and again.

28
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,483
He's dead.

29
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,442
Well, that's less than ideal.

30
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,952
I don't see how petty theft
is part of my training.

31
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,283
There's a lot you don't see.

32
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:21,820
You've no idea how to use
these gifts of yours properly.

33
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,250
- Yeah, and you do?
- No, I...

34
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:26,622
Right now,
your abilities only show up as a reflex.

35
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:28,210
Autonomic, like swallowing.

36
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:29,632
That's a dog's trick.

37
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:31,551
Making it a conscious choice,
using it,

38
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:33,140
that's what makes
you more than poodle.

39
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:35,590
Is insulting me really gonna
help me learn how to do that?

40
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,861
Listen, you're the one who's
a bomb set to blow up me

41
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,432
and everyone in this city unless
I can get you housebroken.

42
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:44,560
That's right,
now he's listening.

43
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:47,310
Now, you absorb all these
abilities you find, yeah?

44
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:48,650
You're invisible with me,

45
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:50,273
you've flown,
you've read some minds.

46
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,963
Yeah, put me in a
coma for two weeks.

47
00:01:52,117 --> 00:01:53,251
Your body doesn't know
what to do with them all.

48
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:54,943
It's gotten jumbled,
like file cards

49
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:56,702
knocking around a shoebox.
Except with you,

50
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:59,912
the cards are dowsed in plutonium,
piling up to a critical mass.

51
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:03,952
Now, I'm gonna teach you how to
pull 'em out, one at a time.

52
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:06,252
You think that's possible?

53
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:07,621
I hope so.

54
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,042
Next time you shut down,
it might not be just a coma.

55
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,493
Might be the day you melt down.

56
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,832
- So then, let's get to today's lesson.
- All right,

57
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,223
let's start by seeing if
you can hold on to one

58
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,632
of your powers without your
benefactors hanging around.

59
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:19,970
You think I can do that alone?

60
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,721
We're about to find out.

61
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:24,351
Remember to breathe.

62
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,571
Hey!

63
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:39,243
Chapter Fourteen - Distractions

64
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,242
God, it sounds like a
bomb is about to go off.

65
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:44,993
I know it's hard.

66
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,053
Just focus on the mirror
and try to relax.

67
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:48,621
I can't relax.

68
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,871
- You're trying to bring her out.
- Jessica...

69
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,082
I told you.

70
00:02:52,387 --> 00:02:53,713
She is dangerous.

71
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,052
- She could hurt you.
- Tell me.

72
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:01,471
Those cuffs could keep an
elephant in that chair.

73
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:03,721
And just 'cause I'm a shrink,

74
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:06,062
don't think I don't know
how to use that Taser.

75
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:08,351
I thought that the goal
was to get rid of her.

76
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:09,731
The goal here

77
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:12,771
is to bring your two halves
to a healthy middle.

78
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,271
To have a unified
and whole you.

79
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:17,990
Not two aspects at war.

80
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,783
How do we do this?

81
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:25,453
Like I said,
you focus on the reflection.

82
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,622
And breathe.

83
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,292
Come on.

84
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,461
Feel free to let
your mind wander.

85
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,383
We used to have a
piano in our home.

86
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,051
You played?

87
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:44,932
Chopsticks, barely.

88
00:03:46,898 --> 00:03:49,852
- My sister...
- Jessica.

89
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,730
She played beautifully.

90
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,112
I used to...

91
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:58,363
play with her sheet music.

92
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:01,030
I didn't... know what it was.

93
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:03,863
It was just... dots and lines.

94
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:08,242
I would...

95
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:11,463
get out my crayons
and connect the dots.

96
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,543
Jessica used to say...

97
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:22,553
that I could turn
Mozart into a monkey.

98
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,512
- I sure did.
- Jessica.

99
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:29,653
You  should have listened
to the little mouse.

100
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,000
How's Claire?

101
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:13,521
That was for the haircut. 

102
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:48,390
You shouldn't have
built such a good cage.

103
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,472
You go anywhere near her...

104
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:53,471
No!

105
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:54,892
No!

106
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,901
Noooo!

107
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:23,423
You didn't just used
your key this time.

108
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:27,882
I shouldn't have them.
Not anymore.

109
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:33,931
You started painting since
you got back from rehab.

110
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:35,432
Can I see 'em?

111
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,393
That's  not done yet!

112
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,111
Oh, God.

113
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:49,863
That's the roof of my
father's building.

114
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:52,243
We had a lot of good
memories up there.

115
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,031
Is that how you remember
our relationship?

116
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:55,702
With all of New York destroyed?

117
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:57,703
What are you
looking for, Simone?

118
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,960
It's Peter. He's still missing.

119
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,130
I'm running out of
places to look.

120
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:07,711
You finally believe I
can paint the future,

121
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:10,221
and you want to use it to
find your new boyfriend.

122
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:12,181
I don't wanna be asking
you this either.

123
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:16,720
- Can you?
- I have been.

124
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,392
Except it's not working.

125
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:22,062
Every time I try to paint
where Peter is, I get nothing.

126
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:24,193
You've been trying
to find him... why?

127
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,900
I know what he can do.

128
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,282
He's the one that's gonna
turn New York into this.

129
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:29,532
I'm not gonna let him.

130
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:33,200
- How do you know so much about him?
- Because I painted it.

131
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,911
I care about you, Simone,

132
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,203
more than I knew
how to say when...

133
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:41,333
when it would have
made a difference.

134
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,291
But right now,
I don't care if you hate me.

135
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,003
I just want you safe.
Stay away from Peter.

136
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:50,170
Just...

137
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:52,722
tell me you'll look for him.

138
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:56,561
I'll try.

139
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,893
Yeah.

140
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:03,560
Simone...

141
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,152
Keep the key.

142
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:26,293
The manatee is on the
brink of extinction.

143
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:28,250
There's one at the
aquarium in Lubbock,

144
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,801
and the marine biologist said
we could stop by any time.

145
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:35,141
You're asking my
permission to skip school?

146
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,970
No, if I wanted to skip school,

147
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:39,932
I'd check into home room and then
sneak out Ms. Roberts' window.

148
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,521
But you've always stressed honesty,
so I'm being honest.

149
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:45,982
The manatee's a very
noble creature.

150
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:49,442
Is your car in working
order, Zachary?

151
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:51,573
- Just had the oil changed.
- Any tickets?

152
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:53,243
Just parking.

153
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:56,781
- You'll be home for dinner.
- Yes.

154
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,242
That's not a question.

155
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,042
I'm making fajitas.

156
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:02,121
Zach, you're
welcome to join us.

157
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,290
Let's go. Come on.

158
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,802
We'll wait 15 minutes,
and then head out.

159
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,010
-  Do you have the directions to Kermit?
- Uh, yeah.

160
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:18,261
Look, what if your
mom wants proof?

161
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:19,930
About the aquarium.

162
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:27,943
- Where did you get these?
- Motel 6 lobby and my color printer.

163
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:33,780
No one can know we're
going to see my real mom.

164
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:37,360
We have to be perfect.

165
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:57,763
Your father looks angry.

166
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,853
My father always looks angry.

167
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:02,680
But your sister looks hot.

168
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:09,813
For this you leave your job,
take an unauthorized vacation.

169
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:13,112
Gorge yourself on
hamburgers and waffles.

170
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:17,151
Waffles are very good.
You would like them.

171
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:20,780
No, Hiro. I would not.

172
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:21,952
No more distractions.

173
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,202
You will come home.
And you will get back to work.

174
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,290
Father, I...

175
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,422
I am on an important mission.

176
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,632
You are only on a plane home.

177
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,302
You will return to
Yamagato Industries.

178
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,092
THAT is what is important.

179
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,890
My job was meaningless.
I worked in a cubicle!

180
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:49,441
I only put you at the bottom so
you would reach for the top.

181
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:53,440
Perhaps I was too strict.

182
00:10:54,156 --> 00:11:00,702
When you return I will make you
an Executive Vice President.

183
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,831
On your way to taking
my place as CEO.

184
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:14,290
You are my only son, Hiro.
This is your destiny.

185
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:18,090
Father.

186
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:21,550
I believe I have...

187
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,521
a different destiny.

188
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:28,233
And what is that?

189
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:30,853
It's... complicated.

190
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:39,491
I have to bring that painting
to a man in Las Vegas...

191
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,570
so I can steal Takezo
Kensei's sword...

192
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,831
then use my power to stop a
bomb from blowing up New York!

193
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:48,450
Kensei?

194
00:11:49,337 --> 00:11:51,832
From those stories I read you?

195
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:55,382
If only I had the sword I
could show you what I can do.

196
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:59,383
Do you want to see what
I think of your destiny?

197
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:06,432
We're going home.

198
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,942
Get a doctor!

199
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,991
Oh... wait. What happened?

200
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,070
No! No! No!

201
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,252
I tried to tell her.

202
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,340
- Take me back to my cell!
- Love to!

203
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,051
Thanks for almost
getting me arrested.

204
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,943
A little more focus, you'd have
had some cash and fresh lipstick.

205
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:46,430
I never said it'd be easy.

206
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:48,603
In fact,
I think I said repeatedly it'd be crap.

207
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,140
You been doing
this for 15 years.

208
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,243
Cut me a little slack on trying
to do it for five minutes.

209
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:53,602
You'll learn.

210
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,243
We just gotta find
what's holding you back.

211
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,631
The cops have my
name and address.

212
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,831
I'm pretty sure Nathan's
gonna kill me first anyway.

213
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,662
You worry a lot about your people,
don't you?

214
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:02,650
Your friends, your mother,
your brother.

215
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:04,783
No wonder your
head's all clogged.

216
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,163
You're still sunk under.

217
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:07,871
- Under what?
- Your attachments.

218
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:09,830
All these people who
feed you biscuits,

219
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:12,580
pat your head, and tell you
you're not fit for the outdoors.

220
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:15,070
You still see yourself through
their eyes, is that it?

221
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,880
- No, I don't.
- Right, well,

222
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:19,800
I'll bet you 20 bucks your dad
didn't make much of you either.

223
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:21,550
Ha! God, you're easy.

224
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,731
We've gotta get these
people out of your head.

225
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:25,183
Do you understand?

226
00:13:25,185 --> 00:13:27,232
These people are my family.
I can't just cut 'em out.

227
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:30,310
Peter can't use his powers
without someone holding his hands.

228
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:33,643
How can you not punch that
face every time you see it?

229
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,690
- He's not like that.
- He is, trust me.

230
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:38,150
- You don't know him.
- I don't need to.

231
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:41,082
I spend a lot of time moving around
people's homes, their bedrooms.

232
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,952
You get to know people if you see 
them when they think they're alone.

233
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,840
You see them for
what they truly are:

234
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,910
selfish, deceitful, and gassy.

235
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,042
So what is that,
your big truth about the world?

236
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,343
Sooner you learn it,
sooner we get that collar off your neck.

237
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,203
People suck, friend.

238
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,872
Every last one of them.
Never forget that.

239
00:13:57,126 --> 00:14:00,592
Not all of them.
Oh, right. There's a girl.

240
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:02,841
She's not like
the rest of them.

241
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,512
Everyone's  like the rest.
That's why they're the rest.

242
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:09,721
Fine, let's go and see
what your girl's up to.

243
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:11,603
Then maybe we can
clear your head.

244
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:16,273
Wait, you wanna... spy on her?

245
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:18,080
Look, you can follow
her all you want.

246
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,581
I'm telling you,
she's not like that.

247
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:21,820
Well, then,
no harm in taking a look.

248
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:25,843
This is bad.

249
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,342
What will we do?

250
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:32,431
Did you put on cologne?

251
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:38,141
Please, Father,
let me speak with him.

252
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,031
Oh, Kimiko.

253
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,670
You have brought shame to our family,
little brother.

254
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:07,090
That was not my intention.

255
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:11,591
Father doesn't need me.

256
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:16,180
You're the one he trusts.

257
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,603
He thinks I'm weird.

258
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:28,072
Father is too proud
to tell you...

259
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:31,531
there is trouble at Yamagato.

260
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:33,491
And now the
stockholders are saying

261
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:36,282
if Father can't
manage is own son...

262
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,911
how can he manage his business?

263
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:47,670
You are his only son.
His heir. You must come home.

264
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,093
How can I?

265
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:53,052
I have a mission.

266
00:16:53,056 --> 00:16:55,590
You are so busy pretending
to save the world.

267
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:57,301
What about saving your family?

268
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:08,363
Maybe you should think about it.
Your powers are gone.

269
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,991
You have no way to get your sword.
Your family needs you.

270
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:14,202
B ut...

271
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:15,910
I was a hero.

272
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:18,201
Listen to Kimiko.

273
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,162
She's the smart one.

274
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,090
Yes, she is!

275
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:32,592
This is it.

276
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:34,802
Number 36.

277
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:37,761
Nice pinwheel collection.

278
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:42,350
You know,

279
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:44,730
I always imagined my
parents would live in a...

280
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,603
penthouse in New York City.

281
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:49,022
Not some trailer
park in Kermit.

282
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:50,903
So she lives in a trailer.

283
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,781
Maybe she likes the open road.

284
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:54,651
Just not what I imagined.

285
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:56,952
Stop imagining.
She's right there.

286
00:17:57,246 --> 00:17:58,621
What am I supposed to say?

287
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:01,741
"Hi, I'm your daughter,
and I can regrow my kidney"?

288
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,793
I mean, what if she's got
burns and scars from the fire?

289
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,373
She's supposed to
be dead, right?

290
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:08,133
So are you, remember?

291
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,091
You already got that in common.

292
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:13,762
Hey... where are you going?

293
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,053
I'm getting rid of
your exit strategy.

294
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:19,680
You'll be fine.

295
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:21,933
I'll be back in
time for fajitas.

296
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:50,501
Claire?

297
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:10,601
Hi, little Fluffy.

298
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:13,521
Claire home from school yet?

299
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:16,112
No?

300
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:19,572
We'll just wait.

301
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,370
Now, what's your name?

302
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,331
Mr. Muggles?

303
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,791
Where are you, baby?
Mama's home!

304
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,711
Of course.

305
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:34,380
Let's go say hi.

306
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:49,731
I-I'm sorry.

307
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,560
Who are you?

308
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:56,361
I just came from the
paper factory, ma'am.

309
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,191
I'm just makin' a delivery
for your husband.

310
00:19:58,496 --> 00:19:59,950
And I saw...

311
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,742
this little guy...

312
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:03,621
in the street.

313
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:06,873
Now, somebody must have
left the back door open.

314
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:09,201
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

315
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,501
I took the liberty.

316
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:18,551
Well, aren't you sweet?

317
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:25,350
And he was just out
there in the yard?

318
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,392
Oh... just chewin'
on a sprinkler head.

319
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,103
Mm! Who left those doors open,
Mr. Muggles?

320
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,441
Claire or Lyle?

321
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:35,561
You tell me,
so I can tan their ass.

322
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,942
Well, thanks for 
invitin' me in.

323
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,150
I always wanted to, uh,

324
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,861
see where Mr. Bennett lived.

325
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:49,203
It is so funny how all of y'all
call him Mr. Bennett over there.

326
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:50,870
I've always just
known him as...

327
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,792
Stop that, you. No more shoes.

328
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:56,922
He just discovered shoelaces.
Can't get enough.

329
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,341
That's funny, I never really imagined
him as much of a dog person.

330
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,720
I  guess he just looms a little
larger when he's drillin' you.

331
00:21:04,978 --> 00:21:06,851
He mostly talks about Claire.

332
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:08,541
I was hopin' to
meet her, actually.

333
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:10,563
I've heard so much about her.

334
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,810
Well, she has promised
to be home for dinner.

335
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,691
Which means a half
an hour late.

336
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:17,561
My son is at a Tai Kwon
Do sleepover tonight.

337
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,483
That means an extra plate.

338
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:22,362
Why don't you stay for dinner?

339
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:27,370
Least I can offer my new hero.

340
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:29,333
Are you sure?

341
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:31,253
It's not too much trouble?

342
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:34,673
I will call my husband and
tell him to expect you.

343
00:21:34,797 --> 00:21:38,131
- What did you say your name was again, Mister...
- Sylar.

344
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,261
Oh, I don't think you'll reach
him at the office, though.

345
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:45,762
Last I saw,
he was just swamped.

346
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,602
I'm staring. I'm sorry.

347
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:00,481
I mean, you have to understand.

348
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:02,441
I never thought
this would happen.

349
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:04,532
You sitting inches
away from me.

350
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,360
You're so beautiful.

351
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,201
Thank you.

352
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:10,871
You a good student?

353
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,792
Um, I'm okay.

354
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:17,172
- Lousy at math.
- No help from me there.

355
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:20,002
Well, I'll bet you're
all kinds of popular.

356
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:22,880
I was homecoming queen.
Kind of.

357
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:24,923
Damn, I missed so much.

358
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,512
If I'd known you were
out there, but...

359
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:30,853
You must think something awful.

360
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,850
I mean, I was so sure that

361
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,602
nothing could have
survived that fire.

362
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,103
It was a miracle
that I did, and...

363
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:41,942
God, when I saw that roof, I...

364
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,033
Don't question the
miracle, right?

365
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,620
Here.

366
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,493
It's horchata.

367
00:22:53,545 --> 00:22:57,250
I learned a secret recipe in Mexico.
It's sweet.

368
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:03,170
- You lived in Mexico?
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,263
Oh, I moved around a lot.

370
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:08,841
After I lost you, I sort of

371
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:11,642
started running.
I never really stopped.

372
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:15,351
And I only came back to
Kermit a couple months ago.

373
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:17,601
I spent some time
in Cuernavaca.

374
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:19,310
And La Paz.

375
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,653
You've never been.

376
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:22,610
Well...

377
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:26,492
Sorry.

378
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:29,490
It's my mom.

379
00:23:31,207 --> 00:23:32,240
Hi!

380
00:23:32,665 --> 00:23:34,542
Yeah, we're at the
aquarium right now.

381
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,753
They just let Zach
feed him turtle grass.

382
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,211
We're practically on our way.

383
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,792
We'll be home in,
like, an hour.

384
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,252
No, I won't let him speed.

385
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:43,462
Okay. Bye.

386
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:47,631
She doesn't know you're here.

387
00:23:50,268 --> 00:23:53,800
She doesn't really understand
what's going on with me right now.

388
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:56,062
Neither of my parents do.

389
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,932
Well, I'll pretend I understand
why you're sneaking around.

390
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,312
All girls deserve
their secrets, right?

391
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,732
Seems like I have a
lot of them these days.

392
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,153
I have to show you something.

393
00:24:11,456 --> 00:24:14,830
You may understand it,
you may not, but...

394
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,540
- I need you to see.
- See what?

395
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,921
I think I know how I
survived that fire.

396
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:29,802
- Claire, don't!
- It's okay.

397
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:38,722
Please say something.

398
00:24:47,657 --> 00:24:49,192
Some family.

399
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,661
I told Claire to get a move on.

400
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,580
She said she'd be back soon.

401
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,423
A cheerleader, huh?

402
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:08,673
- Co-captain by junior year.
- Wow.

403
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:10,551
Although not so
much these days.

404
00:25:10,557 --> 00:25:12,422
They dissolved the
team 'cause of some...

405
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,140
horrible event at the school.

406
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,143
Oh, I heard about that.

407
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:21,391
That must have been
hard on poor Claire.

408
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,983
You are awfully interested
in my daughter.

409
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:28,233
Well, ever since I
seen what she can do,

410
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:30,863
I guess you could
say I'm a... fan.

411
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:33,032
She's really quite gifted.

412
00:25:35,288 --> 00:25:37,951
Oh, you've been to a game?

413
00:25:38,498 --> 00:25:40,832
Yeah, I guess I have.

414
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:43,912
I just couldn't get over
those irresistible...

415
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:47,583
talents of hers.

416
00:25:50,097 --> 00:25:51,260
I should...

417
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:54,760
I should check with my husband again.
Excuse me.

418
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:57,592
I'd rather you didn't
so I can surprise him.

419
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:06,271
- H-h-how did you do that?
- I'm special.

420
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,153
Just like Claire. Well,

421
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:10,070
different. But...

422
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:12,110
you catch the meaning.

423
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:14,532
It's a shame I'll
have to kill her.

424
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,700
Or maybe I'll kill you first.

425
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,830
I really haven't decided yet.

426
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:48,690
Hi.

427
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:01,873
Find him. He dies!

428
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:08,580
I don't understand
what happened.

429
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:09,961
Why was he...

430
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:11,921
he moved the phone

431
00:27:12,217 --> 00:27:13,881
- without even touching it.
- Shh.

432
00:27:14,255 --> 00:27:15,803
You're safe now.

433
00:27:16,056 --> 00:27:17,471
I'm right here.

434
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:19,513
I'll find him.

435
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,353
He kept asking about Claire.

436
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:23,721
Claire is fine. She's safe too.

437
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,022
And she'll stay that way.
I promise.

438
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:34,943
- Who is that?
- This is my friend.

439
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,361
He's gonna make
everything okay.

440
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,243
He'll help you forget again.

441
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:40,860
Again?

442
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,320
What do you mean again?

443
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:44,622
It's okay. Hold my hand.

444
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,700
It'll all be over soon.

445
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,090
You could stay a little longer.
Have some dinner.

446
00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:04,302
I can't cook worth crap, but...

447
00:28:04,687 --> 00:28:07,062
Well, I was supposed to
be home a while ago.

448
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:08,642
I got about six
messages from my dad

449
00:28:08,648 --> 00:28:10,353
telling me to come
home right away, so...

450
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,403
He sounded pretty pissed.

451
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:14,772
This isn't good-bye.
You know that.

452
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:27,040
I was hoping you could
tell me about my father.

453
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,830
Now, that's...

454
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:34,213
complicated.

455
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:39,632
Why don't you let me work
on that for next time?

456
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:43,513
Some family.

457
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,472
Here...

458
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,022
A little something from Mexico.

459
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:50,810
Oh, no, I can't.

460
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:54,900
You can, and you're gonna.

461
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:58,113
It'll look ten times better on
you than it ever did on me.

462
00:28:58,118 --> 00:28:59,400
Okay.

463
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:10,251
Isaac.

464
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,820
We haven't been up here
together in a long time.

465
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:43,533
There's something
about this roof.

466
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:46,280
You and I spent a
lot of time up here.

467
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,450
I mean,
it's connected with what's happening.

468
00:29:48,836 --> 00:29:51,190
- It's important somehow.
- Well, it's certainly mysterious.

469
00:29:51,338 --> 00:29:53,731
You know, I never figured out
how those pigeons got up here.

470
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:54,871
My father always said,

471
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,630
"If they found their way,

472
00:29:56,835 --> 00:29:58,381
we ought to let 'em be."

473
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:04,010
I know we had a lot
together, Isaac.

474
00:30:04,557 --> 00:30:05,882
For a long time.

475
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:10,932
You saw it.

476
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:12,852
The painting of us.

477
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:15,192
It's the future
I still hope for.

478
00:30:19,775 --> 00:30:21,650
This city took me in.

479
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,323
Everything important that ever
happened to me happened here.

480
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:25,401
Good...

481
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,532
bad...

482
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:29,162
you.

483
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:34,083
And now it's all gonna be
destroyed because I can't stop it.

484
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:35,713
You don't know that.

485
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:37,792
It keeps coming back,
worse every time.

486
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,922
You saw what this looks
like after the bomb.

487
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,772
The world will never
recover from that.

488
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,342
That's not true.

489
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:45,303
You can't lose hope.

490
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:49,472
- What hope is there?
- There's you.

491
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:50,931
What you can do.

492
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:53,102
Why else would you be
allowed to see the future

493
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:55,560
unless it was to do
something about it?

494
00:30:55,858 --> 00:30:58,020
You can't just see
the future, Isaac.

495
00:30:58,237 --> 00:30:59,310
You make it.

496
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:01,980
You'll find a way.

497
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:03,861
You really believe that?

498
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,113
I believe in you.

499
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:28,802
I have given it much thought,
big sister.

500
00:31:29,435 --> 00:31:32,552
Please tell Father I will return as
the new Executive Vice President.

501
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,023
This is good news.

502
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:39,193
Oh yes.
It is time to restructure.

503
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:44,981
And consolidate
management in Tokyo.

504
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:48,861
You can't
consolidate management...

505
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:52,410
I'm Executive Vice President,
I can do everything!

506
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,201
That would be a disaster.

507
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:59,462
Oh? You think you
have a better idea?

508
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:04,133
We should expand by making
new acquisitions in aviation.

509
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:09,880
Improve R&D in
biotech, recapitalize...

510
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:14,433
What do you know
of these things?

511
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:21,523
I run three divisions
at Yamagato.

512
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:25,772
If anyone knows how to run this company,
it's me!

513
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,613
Kimiko?

514
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,951
What's gotten into you?

515
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:32,531
My apologies.

516
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:34,621
I did not mean to.

517
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,581
Yes, she did.

518
00:32:38,627 --> 00:32:42,751
Kimiko is smart and dedicated.

519
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:45,590
You don't need me.

520
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:51,381
You have your
successor right here!

521
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,282
- Get dressed!
- Dressed for what?

522
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,081
You're going home.

523
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:22,791
- That's not possible.
- Oh, it's more than possible.

524
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,543
The charges against you have
been dropped, Ms. Sanders.

525
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:27,041
What?

526
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,711
The D.A.
threw out the entire case.

527
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,382
That can't happen.

528
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:33,931
I killed people.

529
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:37,723
The state of Nevada isn't
so sure about that anymore.

530
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:41,143
It seems a rather terrible
gentleman on death row

531
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,690
confessed to all the
crimes you're accused of.

532
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:45,980
DNA evidence backed
up everything.

533
00:33:46,195 --> 00:33:48,482
Wonderful system, isn't it?

534
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,402
As far as they're concerned,

535
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:52,992
justice has been served.

536
00:33:53,495 --> 00:33:56,820
And as far as
Linderman is concerned?

537
00:33:56,916 --> 00:34:00,120
Oh, don't worry about
tomorrow's problems today.

538
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:01,501
No.

539
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:03,333
I need to be in here.

540
00:34:03,717 --> 00:34:05,041
I need help.

541
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,750
You only need to get dressed,
Ms. Sanders.

542
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:10,001
You're going home.

543
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:17,850
And that's the one you love.

544
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:21,272
Off to dinner with the guy
she left to be with you.

545
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:23,562
Sort of fickle,
don't you think?

546
00:34:23,737 --> 00:34:25,061
Why would you show me that?

547
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:27,062
I didn't show you anything.
She did.

548
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,692
We just followed her.
Not even very long.

549
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,942
- I'm sorry, Peter.
- No, you're not.

550
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:33,490
You enjoyed that.

551
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:35,901
You got this rosy film over your eyes,
like a kid.

552
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,873
It's no wonder you live
like an adolescent.

553
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:40,203
Posters on the wall,
hair in your face.

554
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:42,243
You've got to see
the world as it is.

555
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,012
The only way you'll
learn how to save it.

556
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:45,873
And what, be like you?
A hermit?

557
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,852
No one knows you're alive
except for some pigeons.

558
00:34:47,888 --> 00:34:51,383
You have to get rid of your
distractions. The people I love are
not distractions!

559
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:54,193
Then why can't you fly? You've done it.
Your body remembers how.

560
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,971
The only thing standing
in your way is you.

561
00:34:56,057 --> 00:34:58,012
What am I supposed to do?
Cut 'em out of my life?

562
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,323
- How cold do you expect me to be?
- Did you forget you're a bomb?

563
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:02,433
You've got to remember
what this is about.

564
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,151
Or, do you have to ask for your
brother's permission for that as well?

565
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:07,380
Anything else that I have to do?
You wanna make a list?

566
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:11,363
You're a sad cartoon of a broken
heart bleeding all over the place.

567
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:13,082
I'm just trying to get
your mind straight.

568
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:15,461
Look, I have followed you around and
listened to your half-assed wisdom.

569
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:17,073
You don't have
any answers! Okay?

570
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:18,613
You don't know anything.

571
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,033
- You are afraid of the world.
- You have to listen to me.

572
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,081
And I am tired of you
telling me what I have to do!

573
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:27,040
- I don't have to do anything!
- Except fly.

574
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,253
Son of a bitch.

575
00:36:31,317 --> 00:36:33,023
Not quite what I was expecting,

576
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:34,653
but hope for the flowers yet.

577
00:36:38,116 --> 00:36:39,613
You threw me.

578
00:36:39,617 --> 00:36:42,281
Off of a 30-story building!

579
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:44,322
If I didn't regenerate,
I'd be dead!

580
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:46,120
Well, you could have flown.

581
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,262
Listen, if you hadn't
have worked this one out,

582
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:49,662
you'd have been
hopeless anyway.

583
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:51,871
And I'd have to defuse
the biggest bomb ever.

584
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:54,713
But you did it, didn't you?

585
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,303
You cleared your mind.

586
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:59,420
You called out your power.

587
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:08,772
You know,
before I hit the ground...

588
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,022
when I knew what was about to happen,
I had this flash...

589
00:37:12,526 --> 00:37:15,442
in my head,
of this girl that I met in Texas.

590
00:37:15,695 --> 00:37:18,482
This cheerleader.
She could heal herself.

591
00:37:18,828 --> 00:37:21,362
Oh, gosh, she's this sweet kid.

592
00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:24,030
Sad little smile,
and she just...

593
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,331
You were wrong.

594
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:35,083
I don't have to cut her out.

595
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:36,421
I have to remember her!

596
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:37,683
How... how she made me feel!

597
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,763
That's how I...

598
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:54,650
Oh, God.

599
00:37:54,946 --> 00:37:56,363
It's happening.

600
00:37:58,196 --> 00:37:59,442
I'm losing it!

601
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:06,990
Well, it's a start.

602
00:38:22,057 --> 00:38:23,881
Peter?

603
00:38:25,557 --> 00:38:26,473
Yes?

604
00:38:26,477 --> 00:38:28,473
I think I found a
way to stop him.

605
00:38:28,476 --> 00:38:30,853
- I found him.
- Sylar?

606
00:38:31,147 --> 00:38:33,353
- I thought you had Sylar.
- I will again.

607
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:35,020
Soon.

608
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,350
You mean Petrelli. Where is he?

609
00:38:37,355 --> 00:38:38,942
I think he's been
here this whole time.

610
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:40,572
And I've been painting him.

611
00:38:40,578 --> 00:38:42,072
Except no one can see him.

612
00:38:42,078 --> 00:38:44,281
Like he's a ghost, or...

613
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:45,903
invisible.

614
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:48,742
What does that mean?

615
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:54,121
It means an old friend isn't quite
as dead as we thought he was.

616
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:57,043
You have made the
right choice, Father.

617
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:59,040
Let us hope so.

618
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:03,053
This does not mean I approve
of what you are doing.

619
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:07,470
That's okay. You don't have to.

620
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:10,760
Life evolves, Father.

621
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:16,482
And the son you wanted to be like
you will follow his own path.

622
00:39:17,735 --> 00:39:20,271
Now I have to go
save the world!

623
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,820
Should never have read
him those stories.

624
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:34,083
You are insane, little brother.

625
00:39:34,298 --> 00:39:35,583
You are welcome.

626
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:57,643
She's really
starting to like me.

627
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:06,822
Mom? I know it's
not our game night,

628
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:09,121
but can we play a
game of Scrabble

629
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:11,530
- since you just got home?
- Absolutely.

630
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:13,452
I owe you, like, a dozen.

631
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:16,502
- Just give me a minute, okay?
- Okay!

632
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,141
No!

633
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,562
What are you so
mad about, Niki?

634
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:38,642
You're the one who
wanted to be locked up.

635
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:44,112
No... no.

636
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:47,943
I'm home!

637
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:50,111
In the kitchen.

638
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:57,452
You are in big trouble,
young lady.

639
00:40:58,835 --> 00:41:00,412
The school called.

640
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,121
Did you think you could ditch,

641
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:04,001
and I wouldn't find out?

642
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,923
Mom, we talked about
it this morning.

643
00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:08,010
Zach and I went
to the aquarium.

644
00:41:10,977 --> 00:41:16,851
Claire, I think I would remember a
conversation about you skippin' school.

645
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:21,192
- You okay?
- Fine, I...

646
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:24,980
banged my head on something.
Bit of a headache.

647
00:41:26,825 --> 00:41:29,901
Why don't you let me finish,
uh, setting the table,

648
00:41:29,908 --> 00:41:32,242
and you can go lie
down for a little bit.

649
00:41:32,745 --> 00:41:35,663
Don't think this gets
you off the hook.

650
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,740
Hello?

651
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:15,612
You might not remember me.

652
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,163
We haven't spoken in
a long time, but...

653
00:42:20,837 --> 00:42:23,413
Our daughter just found me.

654
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,213
Did you hear what I just said?

655
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,002
She's alive.

656
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,592
We need to talk, Nathan.

657
00:42:32,808 --> 00:42:37,090
