1
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:36,805
Where does it come from?

2
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:41,518
This quest,
this need to solve life's mysteries

3
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:44,729
when the simplest of questions
can never be answered.

4
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:48,400
Why are we are?

5
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,110
What is the soul?

6
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:51,987
Why do we dream?

7
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,533
Perhaps we'd be better
off not looking at all.

8
00:00:56,616 --> 00:00:59,202
Not dwelving, not yearning.

9
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:02,747
That's not human nature.

10
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:05,500
Not the human heart.

11
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:09,671
That is not why we are here.

12
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:26,471
How is he doing?

13
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,440
I'm sorry, did I scare you?

14
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:31,063
No.

15
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:34,883
No, I just...
I keep having these amazing dreams

16
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:37,073
everytime I close
my eyes and...

17
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:38,823
Nevermind.

18
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:43,120
He likes me reading
the stock page.

19
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,311
Is he even conscious at all?

20
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:46,040
No.

21
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:48,503
It's been a week now.

22
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:49,842
I think he's close.

23
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:51,510
A couple more days maybe.

24
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:57,852
You know I don't know
what he'd do without you.

25
00:01:58,105 --> 00:01:59,393
You have a real gift.

26
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:00,520
Just doing my job.

27
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:01,232
No.

28
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,151
You're like a son to him.

29
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:05,831
Yeah, well, that would make
us like brother and sister,

30
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:08,652
it'd be a little ankward if
I ever wanted to ask out.

31
00:02:12,748 --> 00:02:15,491
I'm sorry. That was...
That was inappropriate.

32
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:17,703
No, it's sweet, it's...

33
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:22,162
- I'm dating somebody and I...
- Yeah. No, really, it's okay.

34
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:27,751
I need to change his IV.

35
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:29,383
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:37,271
Man is a narcissistic
species by nature.

37
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:41,110
We have colonized the 4
corners of our tiny planet.

38
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:43,901
But we are not the pinacle
of so-called evolution.

39
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:47,372
That honor belongs to
the lowly cockroach.

40
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,821
Capable of living
for months without food.

41
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:53,542
Remaining alive headless
for weeks at a time.

42
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:54,941
Resistant to radiation.

43
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:58,780
If god has indeed created
himself in his own image,

44
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,041
then I submit to you that god
is a cockroach.

45
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:10,601
They say that man uses only
a 10th of his brain power.

46
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:15,622
Another percent and we might
actually be worthy of God's image.

47
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:19,672
Unless of course that
day has already arrived,

48
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,970
the human genome project
has discovered that

49
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:25,222
tiny variations in
man's genetic code

50
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:28,303
are taking place at
increasingly rapid rates.

51
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:32,182
Teleportation, levitation,
tissue regeneration,

52
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:34,733
is this outside the
realm of possibility?

53
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:38,150
Or is man entering a new
gateway to evolution?

54
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:42,993
Is he finally standing at the
threshold of true human potential?

55
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:47,713
I'm sorry. I'm out of time.

56
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:56,733
I know, I know, I'm beginning to
sound like my father. I can't help it.

57
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:59,070
You know they can fire
me too if they like.

58
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,111
But there is something
to it, Merad.

59
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:02,653
As crazy as it sounds...

60
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:10,160
- What is it?
- It's your father. He's dead.

61
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:15,693
How?

62
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:18,863
Driving a taxi in New York
City is a very dangerous job.

63
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:22,250
The wrong fare, the wrong time,
we may never know what really happened.

64
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:23,921
You know I spoke
to him 2 days ago.

65
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:26,751
He was convincing someone was following
him, trying to steal his research.

66
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:28,212
He died because of his thesis.

67
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:30,002
- That's crazy!
- Is it?

68
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,120
The man left his family,

69
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,432
discredited his career to chase wild
theories halfway around the world.

70
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:36,593
Where are you going?

71
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:39,300
To his apartment,
to get his papers and research.

72
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:41,562
He was this close to
finding the first of them.

73
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:44,341
His patient zero.
He tracked him to Queens, New York.

74
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:46,052
Mohinder, listen to me.

75
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:48,332
Your father was my
colleague and my friend.

76
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:50,930
A respected professor,
a brilliant geneticist

77
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:53,071
but he had clearly lost
touch with reality.

78
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:56,482
I followed in his footsteps.
My thesis is based on his research.

79
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,082
Yes, you always
wanted his approval.

80
00:04:58,117 --> 00:05:00,291
And now you're telling that
it was all for nothing?

81
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:01,400
I'm telling you...

82
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:02,570
to let go.

83
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,041
I need to know why he died.

84
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:06,410
I need to know that it
wasn't all for nothing.

85
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:10,081
And then I need to
finish what he started.

86
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:11,500
Hello?

87
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:15,042
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm in his place now.

88
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:18,412
No, no, no, he left everything
behind but his computer.

89
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:20,821
Research, the map.

90
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:23,752
Yeah, let's get a team in here
to bag and tag everything.

91
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,613
I gotta call you right back.

92
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:57,501
Pervert!

93
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,112
Time to get up, Mika!

94
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:27,692
Mika.

95
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:34,370
Mika!

96
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:36,831
Mika!

97
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:39,210
- Mika!
- What?

98
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:41,341
Damn, Mika,
don't do that to me.

99
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:42,331
Do  what?

100
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,692
You need to be careful. Right?

101
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,711
I'm just working
on my computer.

102
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:49,593
Prologic prog's bad.

103
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:51,462
So I had to build a new one.

104
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:53,880
A new one.

105
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:58,430
Anyone ever tell you you're the
smartest little man on the planet?

106
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:00,433
You do, all the time.

107
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:05,233
What's this?

108
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:09,313
It's a pinhall camera.
It's for the eclipse.

109
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:13,191
The moon's gonna cover
up the sun today.

110
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:14,620
We're supposed to
look at it at school.

111
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,320
Speaking  of which,
you need to go get ready.

112
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,200
You can't be late. Not today.

113
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,920
Mom, I'm already dressed and
I've packed my own lunch.

114
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,890
That's what I've been doing
this morning. What about you?

115
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:26,790
Don't get smart with me.

116
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:29,040
I've been working
to pay our bills.

117
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:31,533
Yeah, that's why they
turned down our gas again?

118
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:35,230
Go grab your stuff and wait
by the backdoor, okay?

119
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:37,130
- Why?
- Just do it.

120
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:47,393
Mom, what's going on?

121
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:50,461
Nevermind, just keep your voice
down and stay close to me.

122
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:21,263
- Camera ready?
- Yeah, almost. Hold on.

123
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:25,021
It's like 70, 80 feet.
This is so unreal.

124
00:10:25,118 --> 00:10:26,273
Okay, I'm good.

125
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:28,482
Okay.

126
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:29,943
Oh my...

127
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:33,113
Oh my God! Oh my God! Claire!

128
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:35,732
Oh my God!

129
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:40,741
Claire!

130
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:58,423
This is Claire Bennett.
That was attempt number 6.

131
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:47,080
You get out here, yes?

132
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:55,712
Mr. Linderman, I'm gonna have to
call you back in 5 minutes, okay?

133
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:56,810
Thank you.

134
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:58,832
I'm late.
I've got a fundraiser and a drinks meeting

135
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,372
It happened two more times.

136
00:12:00,556 --> 00:12:03,041
Sometimes I'm falling,
sometimes I'm flying.

137
00:12:03,227 --> 00:12:05,561
- Sometimes you're in 'em.
- I don't have time for this now.

138
00:12:05,606 --> 00:12:07,513
They aren't just
dreams, Nathan.

139
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:08,631
Hold this.

140
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:09,940
I thought they'd go
away but they're not.

141
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:12,020
I'm gonna need this back by 6,
please. Thanks.

142
00:12:12,058 --> 00:12:14,150
This morning when I got out of bed,
my foot hovered

143
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:15,440
before it touched the ground.

144
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:18,271
Hovered for a split second
like I was floating.

145
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:21,021
I'm telling you,
I think I can fly.

146
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:24,900
Is Owen decided?

147
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:26,962
I'll tell you what,
you think you can fly,

148
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,400
why don't you just off
the Brooklyn Bridge?

149
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:29,450
See what happens.

150
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:33,572
Maybe I oughta start with something a little lower first.
It's le leng twalk.

151
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:35,570
- You're serious?
- Oh, I'm serious.

152
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:36,651
You need to snap
out of it, Peter.

153
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,880
Go see a doctor.
Get some drugs.

154
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,132
Do not pull a Roger
Clinton on me, man.

155
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:42,520
I'm 8 points down in the polls.

156
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:44,200
This is not about you,
all right?

157
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:45,752
Something is happening to me.

158
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:48,483
And I have this feeling that you're the
only person that's gonna understand.

159
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:51,461
Why  the hell would I understand
that you think you can fly?

160
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:53,022
Because you're my brother.

161
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:57,403
Mom, look, I can't talk right now,
I've got...

162
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,772
What?

163
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:00,483
I'll be there in ten minutes.

164
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:04,780
- What did she do now?
- She got arrested.

165
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:07,072
- Arrested for what?
- Shoplifting.

166
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:09,632
I'm so depressed.

167
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:12,302
What? What are you
talking about? Why?

168
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,091
- Camera ready?
- Yeah.

169
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:17,563
Besides the fact that it was so gross,
I almost fudge myself,

170
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:21,483
this is the single coolest thing that
happened in this town in like a
100 years.

171
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,871
Not if nobody finds out,
it's not.

172
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:27,092
Why did you want
me to tape you?

173
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,713
I have my reasons.

174
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,631
It's not like you're not
gonna be popular anymore

175
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:34,043
Popular?

176
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:37,441
who said anything about being popular?

177
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:39,451
my life as I know it is over, okay?

178
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:42,862
I've got the Bishop game next week,
SATs in October,

179
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,192
homecoming is 3 weeks from
today and I'm a freak show!

180
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:46,861
You're being a little dramatic,
don't you think?

181
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:48,351
No, I don't think.

182
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:50,690
I have busted like
every bone in my body,

183
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:52,261
stabbed myself in the chest,

184
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:56,531
I've shoved a two foot steel rod through
my neck and I don't have a scratch
on me.

185
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:59,363
What do you call that thing,
sticking out?

186
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:02,872
Great!

187
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,503
Just give me the tape, okay?

188
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:22,240
I can give you a ride
on my handlebars. If you want.

189
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:27,170
Look...thanks, okay?

190
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:29,930
I'll talk to you in front of
people at school tomorrow.

191
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:32,271
Promise.

192
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:34,042
Your son is a very
intelligent boy.

193
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:37,530
Gifted, actually.
That's not the issue.

194
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:40,160
His father is not around and

195
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:43,492
sometimes I think he could use a
bit of a tronger hand, you know.

196
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:47,672
I work nights a lot but uh...

197
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:50,371
we can both work harder.

198
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,953
It's not about the work.

199
00:16:52,347 --> 00:16:57,160
The truth is I just don't know if
this school is the right fit for him.

200
00:16:57,315 --> 00:17:00,093
- But he's made friends.
- I'm sorry.

201
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:03,542
- He's on the soccer team.
- I'm sorry.

202
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:07,963
I wrote a check for $25,000 to
get him into this snob fest.

203
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:09,880
I was told that's what it took.

204
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:11,410
That's on top of the tuition.

205
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:15,630
About the tuition,
your last 3 checks have bounced.

206
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:17,811
Fine, take it out of the
25 grand that I gave you.

207
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:20,762
That was a donation and
it was very appreciated.

208
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:23,311
Well, I want my money back.

209
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,731
I want my money back now.

210
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:27,863
That money went to capital
campaign for the new wing.

211
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:29,742
- It's already been spent.
- Then unspend it.

212
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:30,810
I'm sorry.

213
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:34,441
We can maybe discuss an extension
of the money you owe but I...

214
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:38,412
I want my money back.

215
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:41,453
That's not possible.

216
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,422
Come on, baby.
Let's get out of here.

217
00:17:45,468 --> 00:17:47,412
You're too good for
this lousy school.

218
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:53,272
Mom?

219
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:58,382
Leave me alone!

220
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:05,413
For god's sakes, ma.

221
00:18:06,026 --> 00:18:06,972
Are you okay?

222
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:08,473
They dropped the charges.

223
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,283
I had to fill out a form.
No big deal.

224
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:11,571
No big deal?
I'm running for Congress.

225
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:13,453
Do you have any idea what this is
gonna do to me if it gets out?

226
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:14,652
With our family's past.

227
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:17,823
What could you possibly need so
bad that you had to steal it?

228
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:19,620
Nevermind, I don't wanna know.

229
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:21,612
- Socks?
- Socks.

230
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,412
Dad left you a fortune.
What are you thinking?

231
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:26,962
You know,
it's been one ridiculous stunt

232
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,803
after another with you
for the last 6 months.

233
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:30,623
Dad's gone. Just get over it.

234
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:32,092
You know what? Leave her alone.

235
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:33,513
She's okay.
That's all that matters.

236
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:36,020
I gotta keep this out of the press.

237
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:39,192
You know what?
Just get out of here.

238
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,470
Go worry about you,
I'll handle this.

239
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:44,083
Yeah, good,
I gotta make sure this stays buried.

240
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:45,512
Thanks a lot, ma'!

241
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:53,480
What  were you thinking?

242
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:56,530
I just wanted to
feel alive again.

243
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:03,411
Nathan only cares
about himself.

244
00:19:03,636 --> 00:19:05,160
Your father was the same way.

245
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:07,201
Alpha dogs, both of them.

246
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:11,123
You, in the meantime,
for all your selflessness and

247
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:14,040
sitting with dying people...

248
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:17,463
What? You're gonna retire
with what you make?

249
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:19,171
Maybe I'll shoplift my socks.

250
00:19:19,278 --> 00:19:20,472
Don't get smart.

251
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:23,342
When you put everyone else first,
you end up last.

252
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:26,052
You always put Nathan first,
he took advantage.

253
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:29,031
It wasn't you that was just pushing
him right out in front of me?

254
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:31,390
He takes up more
space than you.

255
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:32,763
Demanded more attention.

256
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:35,241
And besides it's not my fault,
you allowed it.

257
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,671
He's my brother, I love him.

258
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,033
Love is overrrated.

259
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,112
He loves me too.

260
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,452
You know it.

261
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:43,821
You've always been close.

262
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:44,993
Croseolorlasses.

263
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:46,581
That's cruel, mom.

264
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:50,973
Since dad died I know you've been
feeling free to speak your mind

265
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:54,173
but it wouldn't hurt to edit
yourself every once in a while.

266
00:19:54,308 --> 00:19:56,042
I'm sorry if the truth hurts.

267
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:00,672
I'm just saying you
hero worships him.

268
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:02,842
And those feelings
will never return.

269
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:03,883
You're wrong.

270
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:06,350
It's  biological.
I can't help it. We're..

271
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:08,470
We're connected.

272
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:14,272
I never told you this

273
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:17,193
but when Nathan
had his accident,

274
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,363
I knew it.

275
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:19,660
We all got the same call.

276
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:21,240
No, I'm saying before the call.

277
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:23,902
Like he was telling me.
300 miles away.

278
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,661
I woke up and I knew
that he'd been hurt.

279
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:35,753
I hate it here.

280
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,251
She doesn't even have
any books to read.

281
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:39,432
Baby, I'll be right back.

282
00:20:39,478 --> 00:20:41,230
I'm just gonna go and pack
up a few things, okay?

283
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:42,663
We should really go see dad.

284
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:45,843
- What good would that do?
- He could help.

285
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:47,751
He should know that someone
is trying to hurt us.

286
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:50,770
Your dad is in no position
to help us right now.

287
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:53,733
Look, I made some mistakes.

288
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,531
- I admit it.
- Mom, what did you do?

289
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:00,282
Hey.

290
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:03,871
I need you to know that I would
never let anything happen to you.

291
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,580
I promise.

292
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:08,751
Mom, why did you look at yourself
like that in the fish tank?

293
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:19,763
- How long?
- A couple hours tops.

294
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:21,892
There's some ice
cream in the fridge.

295
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:23,802
Go ahead.

296
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,643
- What happened?
- I went to see Linderman.

297
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:30,943
How much?

298
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:31,902
30.

299
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:33,522
You're gambling again?

300
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,153
No, it's just bills.

301
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,830
I used the rest to get
Mika into private school.

302
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,450
I don't know what to do
with him in public and...

303
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:43,410
it's just I needed them
to think that we had money

304
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,701
on the mob?

305
00:21:46,468 --> 00:21:48,083
Hell, Nicky.

306
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:51,502
- You weren't born yesterday.
- It's just 2 weeks overdue.

307
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,750
I thought that I
could handle it, okay?

308
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:57,343
- I'm under a lot of stress, okay?
- Gee, I wonder why!

309
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,591
I feel like I'm kinda
losing it a little bit.

310
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:06,013
I'm seeing things.

311
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,091
Like?

312
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:11,023
Like I keep feeling like
someone is watching me.

313
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:14,270
Yeah, Linderman wants his money
back so he sent some mouthbreather

314
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,963
that's gonna put
you in the hospital.

315
00:22:16,107 --> 00:22:18,052
No, it is someone else.

316
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:22,140
It's someone that I can't see.

317
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:26,020
Does this make
any sense to you?

318
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:31,562
No.

319
00:22:34,456 --> 00:22:36,742
- I'm sorry. You know what...
- But I'll tell you what does.

320
00:22:36,785 --> 00:22:37,873
I shouldn't be
telling you this.

321
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:39,660
No, let me tell you
what does make sense.

322
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:43,071
You need to come up with that
30 grand plus interests now.

323
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,181
Or you gotta run.

324
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:47,813
Watch him.

325
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:50,693
All right.

326
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,131
Cool, huh?

327
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:20,760
How hot do you think
it is in there?

328
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,683
Turn on the camera.

329
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:17,253
Scotty! Scotty! Come on!

330
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:26,172
-  Take it easy.
- I'm okay.

331
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:27,710
- You're all right.
- I'm fine.

332
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:35,721
There's no burns.

333
00:24:57,777 --> 00:25:00,103
I was real sorry to
hear about your father.

334
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:01,652
Seemed like a good guy.

335
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:04,843
Man!

336
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:07,223
I thought I was a slob!

337
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:09,521
They were here too.

338
00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:11,182
- What?
- Nothing.

339
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:13,160
I got a guy who can clean
this up for a 100 bucks.

340
00:25:13,197 --> 00:25:15,393
No, it's all right.
I'll take it as it is.

341
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:16,943
We rent by the week.

342
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:19,172
I'm gonna need to know
you can afford it.

343
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,820
- I have a job.
- Doing what?

344
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,583
Driving a taxi.

345
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:28,163
I'll get you an application.

346
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:43,150
Oh, god, what?
The si tntreatment?

347
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:47,511
Oh, boy.

348
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:50,631
Isaac...

349
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:53,213
what are you doing?

350
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:55,791
What the hell is wronG with you

351
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:57,710
Isaac

352
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:00,970
Okay, stop

353
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:03,311
What are you, crazy?

354
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:04,390
clearly.

355
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:07,070
I don't even remember
painting these.

356
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:09,190
I Was high, okay?

357
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:10,602
- I lied to you.
- Damn it.

358
00:27:10,706 --> 00:27:12,210
I've been chasing
for a month.

359
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:14,960
Well, then get yourself back into a program
and make it stick this time.

360
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:19,720
What are you talking out?

361
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:23,220
Want to know what I'm talking about?

362
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:26,380
You see this?

363
00:27:26,488 --> 00:27:28,612
Suice bombingin israel.

364
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,282
- I painted it three weeks ago
- Yeah .  and  so?

365
00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:35,290
so...that's this morning's paper.

366
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:36,870
Look at the number on thhe bus

367
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:40,302
This happened yesterday.

368
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:43,283
Yesterday.

369
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:49,140
Something's wrong with me.

370
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:50,450
Well i'll get you help, isaac.

371
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:54,163
I've tried that twice
and there's only one way left, and you know it.

372
00:27:54,335 --> 00:27:56,231
You can't go cold turkey. Not alone.

373
00:27:56,446 --> 00:27:58,152
- I mean, let me help you, please.
-  No

374
00:27:59,086 --> 00:28:00,081
I Love you.

375
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:03,490
I'll drag you down with me. I swear i will

376
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:04,593
just leave me alone.

377
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:06,861
Get out of here!

378
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:11,252
Now!

379
00:28:19,238 --> 00:28:21,290
an unidentified samaritan
witnses ribe as

380
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:25,642
a youg teenage girl ran
into the flames and rescued

381
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:30,052
the young lieutenant. Now, the train is
registered to the nuclear gutory commiion,

382
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:34,550
ss and ere has been no official statement yet
on whawas inhe c

383
00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:48,423
it wasn't easy, nathan,
but consider it gone.

384
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:50,292
I know,
I owe you big on this one, Tom.

385
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:52,963
- I'm not gonna forget it.
- I won't let you forget it.

386
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:54,582
- Thanks.
- Sure thing.

387
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:57,161
Mom's wrap sheet is
now officially buried.

388
00:28:57,267 --> 00:29:00,153
It only took half of my political
capital to pull her off.

389
00:29:00,637 --> 00:29:03,712
Why can't she get herself a hobby?
Like a normal person?

390
00:29:04,435 --> 00:29:06,670
They were married 41 years.

391
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:10,263
It's a plea for attention.
She's lonely.

392
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:11,772
Give her some time, will you?

393
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,852
I don't have time.
I've got 8 days to make up 10 points.

394
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:19,110
I need all the help I can get which
is what I want to talk to you about.

395
00:29:19,286 --> 00:29:20,601
I wanna offer you a job.

396
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:22,652
- A job?
- Yeah.

397
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:25,861
I trust you.
You're good with people.

398
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:28,962
I need a coordinator to help
organize the volunteers and

399
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:31,912
you got nice guy instincts,
I could use that.

400
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:33,820
I'm a shark, Pete.

401
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:35,373
Everybody knows it.

402
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,392
It's starting to show
up in the polls.

403
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:40,963
I bring you on, it kinda reflects
well on me. You know what I mean?

404
00:29:41,136 --> 00:29:43,072
All right,
so I'm making you look good?

405
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:43,962
That's a new one.

406
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:46,042
Makes me look like
I put family first.

407
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:48,222
I mean I know that
sounds self-serving but

408
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:49,671
this is for you too, right?

409
00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:51,192
You gotta think of your future.

410
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:52,552
How do you do that?

411
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:53,341
Do what?

412
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:56,620
Even try to make it look like
this has something to do with me.

413
00:29:57,055 --> 00:29:59,893
You didn't hear anything that
I said earlier today, did you?

414
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,051
You mean about how you can fly?
Yeah, I did.

415
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:04,811
I'm gonna pretend fo both our sakes
you didn't say anything like that.

416
00:30:04,855 --> 00:30:06,742
I'm trying to do the
right thing here.

417
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:08,201
I already have a job.

418
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:11,071
Yeah, watching old people die,
now there's a career.

419
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:12,990
It's not cute anymore, man.

420
00:30:13,126 --> 00:30:15,291
The dreamy kid sitting in
the back of the classroom,

421
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:16,493
staring at the window.

422
00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:19,872
It's time for you to grow up.

423
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:24,213
Look, I cast a big shadow, Pete.
I get it.

424
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:26,081
Life isn't fair.

425
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:28,633
But there's nothing
I can do about that.

426
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:32,092
I'm trying to do the right
thing by you here, okay?

427
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:33,882
I don't want your pity.

428
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:09,390
Hey.

429
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:12,520
Corner of Center
and Canal, please.

430
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:21,931
Wow.

431
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:27,102
- Solar eclipse.
- Yeah.

432
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:29,372
Yeah, I wonder if it's
gonna be a total.

433
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:30,722
Not here, no.

434
00:31:30,946 --> 00:31:32,821
In some other part
of the world, yes.

435
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:34,233
A global event.

436
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:37,910
Makes one appreciate just how
small our planet really is.

437
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:40,571
And we're all quite small really,
aren't we?

438
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:44,580
What's your name?

439
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:46,042
Mohinder.

440
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:47,491
I'm Peter.

441
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:49,436
May I ask you
something, Mohinder?

442
00:31:49,477 --> 00:31:51,960
Do you ever get the
feeling like you were meant

443
00:31:52,108 --> 00:31:55,391
to do something extraordinary?

444
00:31:56,645 --> 00:31:58,572
I'm driving a cab,
you may have noticed.

445
00:31:58,606 --> 00:32:01,081
I'm not talking about what you do,
I'm talking about...

446
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:02,443
who you are.

447
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,243
I'm talking about...

448
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:06,060
being special.

449
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:07,941
Yes, we are all special.

450
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,912
It's not what I meant.

451
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:18,753
Some individuals,
it is true, are more special.

452
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:20,951
This is natural selection.

453
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:23,210
It begins as a
single individual.

454
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:26,462
Born or hatched like every
other member of their species.

455
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:29,421
Anonymous, seemingly ordinary.

456
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:31,181
Except they're not.

457
00:32:31,478 --> 00:32:33,551
They carry inside
them the genetic code

458
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:37,091
that will take their species to
the next evolutionary round.

459
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:40,403
It's destiny.

460
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:50,771
Hey, I can't believe
you left like that.

461
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,112
I know, I was there.

462
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,791
You saved that dude's life.

463
00:34:39,217 --> 00:34:40,701
Welcome home.

464
00:34:50,976 --> 00:34:52,133
Get over there.

465
00:34:52,397 --> 00:34:53,791
50 grand is a lot of money.

466
00:34:53,898 --> 00:34:55,053
50?

467
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:56,773
It was 30.
Even with interest...

468
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:59,012
Mr. Linderman wants to
be nice about this.

469
00:34:59,146 --> 00:35:01,052
You should have read
the fine print.

470
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:05,152
Look, I have a son.

471
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:07,203
I'm all he's got.

472
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,822
Please, I can get
you the money.

473
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,560
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do.

474
00:35:14,627 --> 00:35:17,201
I'm gonna make you a little
business proposition.

475
00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:18,333
You make what?

476
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:22,001
40 bucks for every 20 minutes
you take off your clothes?

477
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:25,091
I'm gonna give you a chance
to lower your debt a little.

478
00:35:25,438 --> 00:35:28,132
And see where it
goes from there.

479
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:32,170
Come on.

480
00:35:38,575 --> 00:35:40,971
Come on. Show me what you got.

481
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:53,312
Lift up your shirt, baby.

482
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,522
Ooh, look at that belly.

483
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:01,111
Smile for me.

484
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,372
Is that what you want?

485
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:05,902
Ah, yes.

486
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,401
What's the matter, baby?

487
00:36:10,547 --> 00:36:12,670
You just gotta
get it good here.

488
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:14,820
What's the problem, baby?

489
00:36:16,428 --> 00:36:17,831
I said what's the matter?

490
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:22,790
Screw you!

491
00:36:22,886 --> 00:36:23,960
Screw me?

492
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:44,522
Hi, this is Nicky.
Leave me a message.

493
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:47,283
mom, are you there?

494
00:38:48,288 --> 00:38:49,451
When are you coming
to get me?

495
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,071
I hate it here

496
00:38:51,488 --> 00:38:54,480
You said you'd be back soon
just come and  pick me up  okay?

497
00:39:45,618 --> 00:39:46,841

00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:05,741
thanks

505
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:22,153
where to my friend?

506
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:24,132
JFK, please.

507
00:40:31,957 --> 00:40:33,650
Going home to my family.

508
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,031
These business trips
are wearing me out.

509
00:40:38,256 --> 00:40:41,240
- Suresh, huh?
- I'm sorry.

510
00:40:41,758 --> 00:40:45,621
Your name...
on your license there.

511
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:47,582
That's indian, yes?

512
00:40:49,477 --> 00:40:53,460
There was a professor Suresh
in the university of Madras.

513
00:40:53,738 --> 00:40:56,383
Geneticist.
Interesting theories.

514
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,101
Don't think he's
teaching anymore.

515
00:40:59,697 --> 00:41:02,853
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

516
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:06,350
Probably a lot of Sureshs
where you're from.

517
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,480
Like Smith... or Anderson.

518
00:41:27,937 --> 00:41:29,421
And then Carla

519
00:41:29,525 --> 00:41:31,012
had the nerve to tell me

520
00:41:31,106 --> 00:41:32,840
he's not breed worthy.

521
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:36,413
Like he didn't win 5 all breed rallies,
two regionals.

522
00:41:36,517 --> 00:41:37,683
Can you believe it?

523
00:41:38,378 --> 00:41:40,252
It's just not true,
Mr. Mubbles.

524
00:41:40,507 --> 00:41:43,392
It's not true, He's a little stud muffin.
That's what he is.

525
00:41:44,025 --> 00:41:46,630
He still humps my
leg when I watch TV.

526
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:49,301
All right, enough about,
Mr. Mubbles.

527
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:51,612
What did everybody
else do today?

528
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:53,612
Doug and I saw
this mexican guy.

529
00:41:53,737 --> 00:41:56,111
A homeless dude,
on the way to school.

530
00:41:56,198 --> 00:41:57,602
We thought he was dead.

531
00:41:57,707 --> 00:41:59,161
But he wasn't.

532
00:42:00,037 --> 00:42:01,832
I thought dad was
coming home today.

533
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:04,081
Well, I was gonna
surprise you...

534
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:06,221
He finished up early,
he's coming home tonight.

535
00:42:06,255 --> 00:42:07,361
Ain't that great?

536
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,340
Just in time to read
my report card.

537
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:12,210
So what about you Claire?
Do anything special today?

538
00:42:17,675 --> 00:42:20,892
I walked through fire
and I didn't get burned.

539
00:42:25,065 --> 00:42:27,050
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

540
00:42:27,185 --> 00:42:28,603
God! You're so crazy sometimes.

541
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:29,303
Lyle!

542
00:42:31,407 --> 00:42:34,152
I think I know
exactly what you mean.

543
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:37,531
Here I am talking dogs again

544
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:41,121
and you go and say
something really profound!

545
00:42:41,536 --> 00:42:44,401
We come up against all
kinds of fires in our lives

546
00:42:44,548 --> 00:42:48,243
and when we test ourselves
and face our fears,

547
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:50,963
we usually don't get burned.

548
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:53,610
You are very wise, sweetheart.

549
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:55,152
Whatever it is you did,

550
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,540
I'm proud of you.

551
00:42:56,628 --> 00:42:59,451
And so is Mr. Mubbles.
He's just so proud of Claire.

552
00:42:59,547 --> 00:43:01,143
Aren't we?
We're proud of Claire.

553
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,961
Yes, we're so proud of Claire,
aren't we?

554
00:44:28,968 --> 00:44:30,831
What are you looking for?

555
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:33,773
- Morphine.
- What for?

556
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:35,151
I need you to come
with me some place.

557
00:44:35,168 --> 00:44:36,072
Where?

558
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:37,323
You'll see.

559
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:40,080
Look, there's something
I need to tell you.

560
00:44:40,205 --> 00:44:41,513
That is gonna have to wait.

561
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,293
No, look,
I need to tell you about this, okay?

562
00:44:44,378 --> 00:44:46,180
I need to stop living
for other people.

563
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:48,680
My whole life, I've...
I've no idea what I'm supposed to do,

564
00:44:48,716 --> 00:44:51,733
what I'm supposed to be if I'm
gonna have a destiny of my own...

565
00:44:51,765 --> 00:44:54,143
I promise you we will talk
about this later, okay?

566
00:44:54,175 --> 00:44:56,760
All right,
now I really need you to come with me.

567
00:44:56,896 --> 00:44:59,550
You're a nurse.
You can give out a shot.

568
00:44:59,768 --> 00:45:01,853
- You can help him.
- Help who?

569
00:45:04,196 --> 00:45:06,030
I thought we could
go to the movies.

570
00:45:06,157 --> 00:45:08,071
It's Saturday. Maybe...

571
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:12,163
try on some shoes at the
new mall in Garden Dale.

572
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:14,953
Sure.

573
00:45:17,586 --> 00:45:18,960
I love you, mom.

574
00:45:20,588 --> 00:45:21,382
But?

575
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:29,050
No buts, I just...
wanted to tell you that.

576
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:33,052
No, you think I'm trying to be
your best friend again, admit it.

577
00:45:33,187 --> 00:45:34,472
No, it's...

578
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,052
It's all right,
we can go to the movies together.

579
00:45:37,108 --> 00:45:38,483
It's no big deal.

580
00:45:38,855 --> 00:45:42,022
I just miss you. That's all.

581
00:45:43,695 --> 00:45:46,821
I wanna be your mom. I wanna...

582
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,153
give you advice but I
don't wanna push you away.

583
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:52,491
I want advice, I do. I...

584
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,333
I won't push you
away I promise.

585
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,380
I just don't think you should
be so worried about...

586
00:46:04,466 --> 00:46:06,382
fitting in all the time.

587
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:09,093
About being so popular.

588
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:11,972
I don't wanna see you
make mistakes like I did.

589
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:15,601
I wanted to be someone more
interesting than I am.

590
00:46:16,187 --> 00:46:17,561
You are interesting.

591
00:46:17,685 --> 00:46:20,522
You breed show dogs.
Whose mom does that?

592
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:23,901
No, I wanted to
hitchhike across Europe,

593
00:46:24,028 --> 00:46:25,152
study art,

594
00:46:25,275 --> 00:46:26,980
fall in love with some...

595
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,073
poetry quoting french man.

596
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:32,400
Not that your dad isn't
wonderful but my point is...

597
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:35,700
You should know who you are
and know that it's enough.

598
00:46:35,837 --> 00:46:38,491
'Cause who you are is special.

599
00:46:41,587 --> 00:46:43,332
About that.

600
00:46:44,796 --> 00:46:46,882
There's something
I need to say.

601
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:51,723
Something I never talked about 'cause
I thought it would upset you and dad.

602
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:55,593
Sweetheart, you can say anything to us,
you know that.

603
00:46:58,185 --> 00:47:01,681
I think I'm old enough for you to
tell me who my real parents are.

604
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:07,021
Of course, you are.

605
00:47:11,035 --> 00:47:12,030
Honey!

606
00:47:12,745 --> 00:47:13,650
I'm home!

607
00:47:14,286 --> 00:47:15,362
Your father...

608
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:20,373
Hey, honey.

609
00:47:21,915 --> 00:47:24,173
Bad Mr. Mubbles! No!

610
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,131
- I'm glad you're home.
- Oh, me too.

611
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,390
I've such a headache. I slammed my
head getting out of a taxi cab.

612
00:47:33,426 --> 00:47:34,592
Hi, daddy!

613
00:47:37,478 --> 00:47:39,220
Hey, baby!

614
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:01,103
I'm just saying it's
impossible, okay?

615
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,733
- Nobody can predict the future.
- I saw it with my own eyes, Peter.

616
00:49:03,768 --> 00:49:05,843
Isaac! I brought
someone here to help.

617
00:49:05,935 --> 00:49:06,971
He's a nurse.

618
00:49:09,315 --> 00:49:10,272
Isaac!

619
00:49:12,688 --> 00:49:13,603
Isaac!

620
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,112
Isaac!

621
00:49:21,866 --> 00:49:22,843
isaac

622
00:49:23,278 --> 00:49:24,571
Simone

623
00:49:25,455 --> 00:49:26,533
Oh God!

624
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:28,241
Okay.

625
00:49:29,006 --> 00:49:31,410
- Oh my God! Isaac?
- He's alive.

626
00:49:31,628 --> 00:49:33,000
- Call 911.
- Yes.

627
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:35,803
What have you done?

628
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,123
God, he's overdosed.

629
00:49:45,855 --> 00:49:50,361
Yeah, I'm at 215 Reed Street.
Number 7.

630
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:52,322
I need an ambulance
here immediately.

631
00:49:52,385 --> 00:49:53,630
he's OD

632
00:49:55,108 --> 00:49:56,763
no, no, he's conscious

633
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:58,993
Just barely.

634
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:05,833
I know. Listen, could you just come
and get here soon, please.

635
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:11,311
Okay, baby, it's okay.
they'rr sending an ambance  right away, okay?

636
00:50:11,658 --> 00:50:13,093
you just hang in there, okay?

637
00:50:13,195 --> 00:50:15,362
You're gonna be okay,
I swear.

638
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:21,192
We have to stop it.

639
00:50:26,285 --> 00:50:27,700
We have to stop it.

640
00:50:40,347 --> 00:50:41,500
This quest,

641
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:45,841
this need to solve
life's mysteries.

642
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:48,510
In the end what does it matter

643
00:50:48,606 --> 00:50:53,220
when the human heart can only find
a meaning the smallest of moments.

644
00:50:54,646 --> 00:50:56,141
They're here.

645
00:50:57,158 --> 00:50:58,353
Among us.

646
00:50:59,406 --> 00:51:01,942
In the shadows, in the light.

647
00:51:03,116 --> 00:51:04,493
Everywhere.

648
00:51:06,618 --> 00:51:08,320
Do they even know yet?

649
00:51:22,175 --> 00:51:23,922
All right, I'm here.

650
00:51:25,426 --> 00:51:26,800
Now what do you want?

651
00:51:29,226 --> 00:51:29,890
Peter?

652
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:39,021
I've been up here all night.

653
00:51:39,158 --> 00:51:40,860
Thinking about this.

654
00:51:40,985 --> 00:51:42,651
Thinking about my destiny.

655
00:51:43,948 --> 00:51:45,491
What you doing, Pete?

656
00:51:45,695 --> 00:51:48,360
It's my turn to be
somebody now, Nathan.

657
00:51:48,785 --> 00:51:51,163
Come on, Peter.
Quit screwing around.

658
00:52:33,626 --> 00:52:34,540
Peter!

659
00:52:42,168 --> 00:52:42,791
You're flying nathen

660
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:45,851
You're flying...

661
00:52:46,695 --> 00:52:47,493
How did you

662
00:52:47,546 --> 00:52:48,891
I don't know.

663
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:55,432
no
