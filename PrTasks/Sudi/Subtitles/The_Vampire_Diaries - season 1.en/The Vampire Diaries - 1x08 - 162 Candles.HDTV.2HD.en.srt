<i>I know the risk
but I have to know her.</i>

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,134
- She's a deadringer for Katherine.
- What are you?

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,637
I'm vampire.
I've been 17 years old...

6
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,096
since 1864.

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,757
I promis I will keep your secret but
I can't be with you Stefan.

8
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:20,558
- Five bodies all drained of blood.
- They've come back.

9
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:21,687
Hello, brother.

10
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:25,983
- She's transitioning.
- Into what?

11
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,985
- A vampire.
- Vicki, what the hell?!

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,420
- Why is everybody have to die on me?
- Can you make him forget?

13
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:34,523
I'll do it.
What do you want him to know?

14
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:38,652
That Vicki left town, he's gonna misss
her but he knows it's for the best.

15
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:51,117
Lexi?

16
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,492
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

17
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:57,517
How could you even ask that?

18
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:59,681
I missed you.

19
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:02,475
Happy birthday.

{\pos(192,230)}I'd bail in under 60. And...

25
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,726
{\pos(192,230)}why is a news reporter
hunting vampires?

I don't know who knows about us.
That guy did.

27
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,770
{\pos(192,230)}There could be others. Do me a favor.
While you're here, please be careful.

00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,400
{\pos(192,230)}Do you think that
he would actually remember us?

34
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:42,620
- That was a pretty crazy weekend, huh?
- We can make him remember us.

35
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,956
Come on! Let's go.

36
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,709
{\pos(192,230)}- I mean, what's keeping you here?
- I told you.

37
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:50,374
Her name is Elena.

38
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,298
Well, let's hope she's better than
the last girl you got all sprung over.

39
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:57,040
You didn't even know Katherine.

40
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,870
{\pos(192,230)}Cause if I did, I'd kick her ass.

41
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,596
{\pos(192,230)}Little bitch. Speaking of... 

42
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:04,046
- Where's Damon?
- Inflicting misery somewhere.

43
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:09,025
{\pos(192,220)}You gonna be okay here alone?
I got some things I gotta take care of.

44
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,732
It's not exactly
like I can go anywhere.

45
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:15,861
And you and Damon are the only ones
with these nifty little daylight rings.

46
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:18,864
I have a mood ring
from '75. Trade ya?

47
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:21,575
{\pos(192,230)}Doesn't work that way
and you know it.

48
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,581
- I'm really glad that you came here.
- What are we doing

49
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,876
for your birthday? It's not every day
a guy turns 162 years old.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
{\pos(192,230)}Really?

51
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,504
Where did Vicki say she was going?

52
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:41,523
- She didn't.
- Did she tell her brother

53
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:44,170
{\pos(192,220)}- where she was going?
- She didn't say anything to me.

54
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:46,386
{\pos(192,220)}She told Jeremy to tell me
she was leaving town.

55
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:49,372
{\pos(192,220)}Is there anyone I can talk to that
may know what happened to her prior

56
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,716
{\pos(192,220)}- to her leaving town?
- Stefan Salvatore may know.

57
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:54,358
{\pos(192,220)}He came by the house to see her
but she wouldn't talk to him.

58
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,941
- What was he doing there?
- I was trying to help her.

59
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,682
{\pos(192,220)}I knew that Elena was worried
about her brother.

60
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,908
{\pos(192,220)}He was dating Vicki and she had
a drug problem, so I tried to help.

61
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,428
{\pos(192,220)}So you got involved
because Elena asked you to?

62
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:07,115
{\pos(192,220)}I asked Stefan to help.

63
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,293
{\pos(192,220)}I thought that by helping Vicki,
he was helping my brother.

64
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:13,374
{\pos(192,220)}What was her behavior like
those last few days before she left?

65
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:14,599
{\pos(192,220)}Up and down.

66
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:16,958
{\pos(192,220)}Very sketchy, like...

67
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,259
{\pos(192,220)}she was coming down
from some major party.

68
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,027
- Any signs of aggression or violence?
- Not that I remember.

69
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:27,641
{\pos(192,220)}So you believe
Vicki really has left town?

70
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll miss her, but...

71
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,448
I think it's for the best.

72
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,159
I was tryin' to help her, Matt.
That's all.

73
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,172
I'll meet you guys at the car.

74
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:07,936
You okay?

75
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,454
I don't think the sheriff
suspected anything.

76
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,988
Jeremy had no memory at all.

77
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:13,979
All he knew was what
Damon made him know.

78
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,182
Thank you.

79
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:19,818
I can't do this, Stefan.

80
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,039
Every time I look at Matt or Jeremy,

81
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,991
all I think is that
Vicki is never gonna come back,

82
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,614
And they'll never know why.

83
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:31,251
Around you, people get hurt
and people die and I just...

84
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:32,748
It's just too much...

85
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:36,801
Why don't we go somewhere
and talk about it?

86
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:40,013
You have to stay away from me.

87
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,692
What an unexpected surprise.

88
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:02,366
Unexpected surprise?

89
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,030
I think the wrong brother
went back to high school.

90
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,992
- How long you here for?
- Just for Stefan's b-Day.

91
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,609
You mean you didn't come
all this way to see me?

92
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,914
That's it, Damon.
After a century, I finally realized

93
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,182
death means nothing without you.

94
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,751
Do me.

95
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,588
Why are you so mean to me?

96
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:24,466
Have you met you?
You're not a nice person.

97
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:28,137
- Because I'm a vampire.
- But you're only the bad parts.

98
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,180
Teach me to be good.

99
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,609
I'm older, and that means stronger.

100
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,978
- Sorry.
- Don't ruin my time with Stefan,

101
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,604
cause I'll hurt you.

102
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:39,815
And you know I can do it.

103
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:52,415
You leavin'?

104
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,169
Dad doesn't like it
when I stay here too much.

105
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:58,042
Because he misses you,
or because he doesn't trust me?

106
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:01,140
Your father's problem
is he lacks imagination.

107
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:04,506
He thinks I fill your head
with all my witchy juju.

108
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,425
- He's right.
- He's always right.

109
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:08,302
That's his other problem.

110
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:11,465
You need to be wearin' that.

111
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,071
I gotta get it back to Caroline.
It doesn't belong to me.

112
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:16,889
Yes, it does. It was your ancestor's
and now it's yours.

113
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:19,271
Emily was your ancestor, too.
Why don't you wear it?

114
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,816
It didn't find me. It found you,
protected you.

115
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,656
A witch's talisman
is a powerful tool.

116
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,545
Don't be givin' that back
to anybody.

117
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:37,717
I just wish it was prettier.

118
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,345
You're wallowing.

119
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:44,885
So are you.

120
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,883
My wallow is legitimate.
I was dumped.

121
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,430
- Yeah. Well, Logan's a jerk.
- You didin't get a brushoff e-mail

122
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,148
saying, "I'm leaving town.
See ya."

123
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,101
- Wanna keep it down over there?
- Why? What are you doing?

124
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,269
Homework.

125
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:01,522
Since when do you do homework?

126
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,690
I gotta finish this. I'm way behind
and I have a quiz tomorrow, so...

127
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:09,694
What do you think?
Alien?

128
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,429
Some sort of replicant.

129
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,567
He can hear you.

130
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,049
Send him in.

131
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,424
Mr. Salvatore, come on in.

132
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,467
- Could you get the door for me?
- Sure.

133
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,428
I understand from Mrs. Lockwood
that your uncle's out of town.

134
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:37,133
Yes, he is.
But I spoke with Zach.

135
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:40,865
He filled me in and asked
if I could bring this to you.

136
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:53,794
Vervain.

137
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,702
That's all we have at the moment.
I hope it's enough.

138
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:02,749
It's a small circle...

139
00:09:03,273 --> 00:09:05,502
Founding families,
a few city officials.

140
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,213
And your deputies, of course, right?

141
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,466
Are we any closer?

142
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:14,386
I think our facts are wrong.

143
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:19,057
We've always believed that vampires
can only come out in the dark.

144
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,875
What if that's changed?

145
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,742
Is that even possible?

146
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,980
We've exhausted every other option.

147
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,334
We have to consider the vampire
may be walking around during the day

148
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,009
right in front of us.

149
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:37,326
- So what's the next step?
- We're now looking at anyone

150
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,871
new to town since the deaths began.

151
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,748
Should turn up a suspect or two.

152
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,209
And I of course
will do anything I can to help.

153
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:52,772
{\PUB}You up?

154
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,978
Why haven't you called me back?

155
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:04,436
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,855
{\pos(150,268)}Are you gonna stay in there forever?

157
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:09,524
Move over.

158
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,157
I'm officially worried.

159
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,628
What's going on?

160
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:23,589
I'm tired of thinking...

161
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,512
of talking. I...

162
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,585
Can I get a one-line version so
I can at least pretend to be helpful?

163
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,353
Stefan and I broke up.

164
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,430
I'm so sorry.

165
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:35,914
Are you okay?
Right. Stupid question.

166
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,680
I know I've been kind of MIA

167
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,127
when you need me the most.

168
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,142
I suck.

169
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,160
You wanna make it up to me?

170
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,038
Get my mind off of it.

171
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:53,277
Just remember you asked for it.

172
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:08,542
Be patient.

173
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,557
I need to swear you to secrecy.

174
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:15,969
It's kind of a bad week
for that kind of stuff.

175
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,467
Swear, cause I'm not supposed
to be showing you this.

176
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:20,804
- I swear.
- There's no windows open, right?

177
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,510
- Right.
- There's no fan, 

178
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:26,351
- no air conditioning.
- None. What are you doing?

179
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,330
Grams just showed me this.
You're gonna love it.

180
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,455
You ready?

181
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,708
Bonnie, what's going on?

182
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:18,570
It's true, Elena,

183
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,155
Everything my grams told me.

184
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:22,741
It's impossible,

185
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,257
But it's true.

186
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:27,153
I'm a witch.

187
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,639
I believe you.

188
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,262
Look, dungeon boy,
I'm done being your little slave girl.

189
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,433
You seriously hurt me
and I will be damned if you think...

190
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:53,114
Oh, my God.
Where have you been?

191
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,872
- It's really good to see you.
- Much better.

192
00:12:56,997 --> 00:13:00,018
You wanna throw a party
here at the Grill tonight.

193
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:01,655
Why don't you do it?

194
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,574
Because then Stefan and his BFF
won't come. I need a lot of people,

195
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,592
big crowd. Invite everyone.

196
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:08,787
And why am I having this party?

197
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,249
Because you are gonna help me solve
this town's little vampire problem.

198
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,336
- And I want my crystal back.
- But Bonnie has it.

199
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:18,275
I know that.

200
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,756
Get it from her.

201
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,762
So, this Elena girl,
she'll come around. I'm sure of it.

202
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,065
Have you had sex yet?

203
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:29,687
Sex always works.

204
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,675
You'll rock her world so hard
with your vamp sex,

205
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,737
- She'll be yours forever.
- Yeah, but see, this isn't about

206
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:38,316
sex or... or compulsion

207
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,131
or any of our other tricks.

208
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:43,155
She has to want
to be with me on her own terms.

209
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,158
That sounded
all mature and grown-up.

210
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,034
I'm not getting any older.

211
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,795
Want some?

212
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:00,923
Thank you.

213
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:03,467
Relax. I didn't kill anyone for it.

214
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,385
This phlebotomist I went out
with a few times, he's my supplier.

215
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,432
Don't judge, okay?

216
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,271
Listen, I tried the animal diet.
Lasted 3 weeks.

217
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:15,714
Doesn't matter.
Cause if I started again...

218
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,289
- I don't know if...
- You could stop.

219
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:25,479
- I'd never judge you.
- I'm just jealous of your restraint.

220
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:28,033
I have none.
I delight in hedonism.

221
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,127
Speaking of which,

222
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:33,657
- What are we doing tonight?
- Funny you should ask.

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,874
Well, I wasn't asking you.

224
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,260
There's a party
at the Grill. You'll love it.

225
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:40,212
Banquettes, tacky wait staff.

226
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,797
All of Stefan's friends.

227
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,623
- I don't want a birthday party.
- Well, it's not for you.

228
00:14:44,748 --> 00:14:47,769
It's a party party. No one's
gonna know it's your birthday.

229
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:50,388
- Caroline's throwing it.
- Damon, stay away from Caroline.

230
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,306
We're friends. It's cool.

231
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:55,850
It's important for the town to see us
out and about like normal folk.

232
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,187
We need to blend.

233
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:04,194
I prefer mine at 98.6.

234
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:09,675
Let's go.

235
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,787
Please?

236
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:18,291
It's weird, huh? After all this time
joking about being psychic,

237
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,460
I really am a witch.

238
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:25,458
You don't think
I'm a freak now, do you?

239
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,983
No. Of course not.

240
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:30,393
I just... I don't understand, though.
If your grams asked you

241
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:32,722
to keep all this a secret,
why did you tell me?

242
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,490
You're my best friend.

243
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:36,601
I can't keep secrets from you.

244
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:43,316
I'm almost ready.

245
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:46,217
Can't believe you actually think
that we should go to this thing.

246
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:49,359
It's not like I'm asking you to run
outside midday without your ring.

247
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:51,533
I mean, seriously, it's a party.

248
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,571
A party that Damon wants us to go to,
you know. So my question is,

249
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,962
- "why?" I think he's up to something.
- Who cares?

250
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:00,458
I mean, what can he possibly do in front
of all those people in a public place?

251
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,587
He knows how to keep
a low profile, believe me.

252
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,048
So he'll behave.
Come on. One day a year, I get you,

253
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,316
One day that you're not brooding

254
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,303
and existing in your own head.

255
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:15,473
- It's my birthday, yeah?
- It's my day, and that guy

256
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,809
That jumped naked
in the Trevi Fountain and

257
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,029
got drunk on the Torch
of the Statue of Liberty, That guy

258
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:23,830
can take a break from all
of his worrying for one night

259
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,943
and go to a stupid party.
So quit your whining...

260
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,003
and go get ready.

261
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:33,193
Fine.

262
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,291
<i>It's open. Come on in.</i>

263
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:02,270
How...

264
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,667
- Who...
- I'm Elena.

265
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,406
- Who are you?
- Lexi.

266
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,490
A friend of Stefan's.

267
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:17,243
- Is he here?
- He's in the shower.

268
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:20,819
Do you wanna wait?

269
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:24,853
I'll tell him you stopped by.

270
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,078
That's okay.

271
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,969
Are you out of your freaking mind?

272
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,447
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,217
I just met Elena.

274
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:45,146
You have some serious
explaining to do.

275
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:51,962
{\Pub}You have some serious
emotional damage.

276
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,823
It's not what you think.
She's not Katherine.

277
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,208
Then they're related
because they could be twins.

278
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,107
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

279
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:02,009
- You didn't find out?
- No. Maybe I don't wanna know.

280
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:04,833
I have no desire
to tie Elena to Katherine.

281
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,514
The resemblance is what
drew me in but that's it.

282
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,504
Katherine and Elena may look
the same on the outside,

283
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:18,433
But on the inside,
they are completely different.

284
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:21,293
So Elena's not
a raging bitch then, huh?

285
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:25,918
No, Elena is...

286
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,816
Elena's warm,

287
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,270
And she's...

288
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,584
She's kind and she's caring
and she's selfless,

289
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:38,586
and it's real.

290
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:40,706
And...

291
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:43,398
honestly, when I'm around her...

292
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,524
I completely forget what I am.

293
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:50,848
You're in love with her.

294
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:57,446
Yeah, I am.

295
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,538
Amazing party, right?

296
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,356
Glad you thought of it.

297
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:32,337
- Well, are you having a good time?
- Do you have my crystal?

298
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,530
Then I'm not having a good time.

299
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,066
- Where's my brother?
- He said he'd meet me here.

300
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:51,291
Buy you a...

301
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:00,762
What are you doing rere?

302
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,619
Lexi said that you came by
and you seemed upset.

303
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:06,835
Right.

304
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,125
The girl in the towel.

305
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,590
The towel?

306
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:19,384
Not like that. No.
She's not exactly a girl. Lexi's...

307
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,512
She's 350 years old.

308
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,073
You mean she's a...

309
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:27,029
And she's my oldest friend.

310
00:20:27,154 --> 00:20:28,656
Nothing romantic.

311
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,144
Ever.

312
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:34,528
Okay, well...

313
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:37,277
she kept staring at me.
It was weird.

314
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:41,656
Well, you know,
I've talked about you

315
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,924
a lot, so...

316
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,143
guess she felt like she knew you.

317
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,049
So why'd you come by?

318
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:55,170
It was a mistake.

319
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,149
- Elena, talk to me.
- I can't.

320
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:05,930
Stefan, I can't
and that's the problem.

321
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,380
I'm keeping all these secrets
from everyone.

322
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,310
I can't even tell my best friend.

323
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,353
Do you know how hard that is?

324
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:17,172
It's like I need to talk to someone
but the only person I can talk to is

325
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,174
you... and...

326
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:24,706
I want you to know

327
00:21:25,844 --> 00:21:28,624
that I will always be here for you.

328
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:33,243
You can come to me
about anything, okay?

329
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:38,567
Well, thank you for coming by.

330
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,184
Do you need a ride
to the Grill tonight?

331
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:55,396
- Are you going to Caroline's party?
- Lexi's dragging me.

332
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:57,626
And...

333
00:21:58,429 --> 00:21:59,779
it's my birthday.

334
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,439
Really?

335
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,083
- Happy birthday then.
- Thank you.

336
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,108
Actually, I...

337
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:13,456
I think I'm gonna stay in tonight.

338
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,640
Well, have... have a good night.

339
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:46,990
I've been looking for you.

340
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,147
I'm totally sorry to do this.
I know it's so indian giver,

341
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:52,829
and we're not even supposed
to say that anymore, but

342
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:56,776
- I need my crystal back.
- Why? You said you hated it.

343
00:22:57,182 --> 00:23:00,852
Then I saw it on you
and I realized how great it is.

344
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:03,810
And I've got, like, three outfits
I can coordinate it with, so...

345
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:05,835
I can't give it back to you.

346
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:10,430
Well, I didn't want
to have to tell you this,

347
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,098
but I'm your friend.

348
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,184
When you wear it,
it makes you look fat.

349
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,602
There. I said it, but
it's because I'm your friend, so...

350
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:20,481
I'm sorry. Caroline, I can't.

351
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:24,360
What do you mean
that you can't, Bonnie? It's mine.

352
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,800
- I thought you said it was Damon's.
- It is.

353
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:29,429
So he's the one
who really wants it back?

354
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:32,544
Maybe. Just...

355
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,152
Are you wearing polyester?

356
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:39,556
You were really gonna pull it
from my neck?

357
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:42,717
What the hell is wrong with you?

358
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:02,135
Just hear me out?
Please?

359
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:04,442
I was just trying to help Vicki.

360
00:24:04,857 --> 00:24:07,737
I went through
something similar once.

361
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:11,644
I'm really sorry.

362
00:24:12,907 --> 00:24:15,953
Don't be.
It's not the first time she's run off.

363
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:18,942
Turns out
Vicki's just like her mother.

364
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,167
I can't count on either of them.

365
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:24,627
Thanks for trying.

366
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:33,434
Where is it?

367
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:35,473
Bonnie won't give it to me.

368
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,141
So rip it off her neck.

369
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,959
I tried. It shocked me.

370
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Damn it.
Why does it do that?

371
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,691
- I need that crystal.
- Why are you being like this?

372
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,886
I'm so good to you
and I'd do anying.

373
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,538
It's just some stupid necklace.

374
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,909
You are the only stupid thing here.

375
00:24:56,238 --> 00:24:57,338
And shallow.

376
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,285
And useless.

377
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,047
Okay, I'm gonna need
a little more foot movement.

378
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:11,137
Yeah, I'm not really interested
in making a fool out of myself.

379
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:12,911
Come on. You're not that bad.

380
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:15,972
Do me a favor. Tell me if you see
Damon with his camera phone.

381
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,097
Right.

382
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:27,155
<i>- Where are we going?
- No one's gonna see us...</i>

383
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,930
- Did you hear something?
- No. It's cool.

384
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:55,187
There's no one coming down here.

385
00:26:08,215 --> 00:26:09,215
{\PUB}Nice!

386
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:34,258
Stefan smiles.

387
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,353
Alert the media.

388
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:39,931
You haven't given him
a lot of reasons to be happy lately.

389
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,899
You're right. Poor Stefan.

390
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:46,429
Persecuted throughout eternity
by his depraved brother.

391
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,950
Does it get tiring
being so righteous?

392
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,302
It flares up
in the presence of psychopaths.

393
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:59,242
Well, consider
this psychopath's feelings hurt.

394
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,329
What did you do to my brother?

395
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,374
I'm gonna need
a less vague question.

396
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:09,016
When you did what you did
to Jeremy's memory of Vicki,

397
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:12,651
- What else did you do to him?
- You asked me

398
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:15,209
to take away
his memory of fangs and...

399
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,934
and all the bad stuff.

400
00:27:17,306 --> 00:27:19,345
You wanted me
to take away his suffering.

401
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,986
But he's acting different.

402
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:23,766
He seems okay with everything
and a little too okay.

403
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,894
I mean, he's studying. He's not
doing drugs. He's not drinking.

404
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:30,021
Are you sure
you didn't do something else?

405
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:32,477
I took away his suffering.

406
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:38,573
- Don't talk to me.
- Don't do that. Let me explain.

407
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,575
What is there to explain?
You got what you wanted...

408
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,537
And something that doesn't even
belong to you, by the way.

409
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,623
And I get called a shallow,
useless waste of space.

410
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,807
- Who said that to you?
- Who do you think?

411
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:52,455
You know that's not true.
Don't let him treat you like that.

412
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,339
As opposed to how
my best friend treats me.

413
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,117
Two shots of tequila.

414
00:28:35,853 --> 00:28:37,153
Make that three.

415
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,067
I need to see some ID.

416
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,770
No, you don't.

417
00:28:46,454 --> 00:28:48,142
- That'll be...
- Free.

418
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:50,811
- On the house.
- Thanks.

419
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,071
The famous Elena.

420
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:02,977
Towel girl.

421
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:06,002
I've been called worse.
Here.

422
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,131
I didn't know
that you guys could drink.

423
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:12,406
Yeah. It helps curb the cravings,

424
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:15,211
But makes for a lot of lushy vamps.

425
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,761
I've never seen Stefan drunk.

426
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,842
- He always seems so...
- Uptight?

427
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:25,819
But not with you.

428
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,211
That's the benefit of knowing
someone for over 100 years.

429
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:30,684
You can just be yourself.

430
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:34,458
- He can't be himself with me.
- Well, not yet.

431
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,833
The first step was him telling you.

432
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,609
The rest comes with time.

433
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:41,442
You seem so sure.

434
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,383
The love of my life was human.

435
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:51,359
He went through what
I imagine you're going through...

436
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:53,467
Denial, anger, et cetera.

437
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:56,531
But at the end of the day,

438
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:59,269
love really did conquer all.

439
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:06,293
Are you gonna drink that?

440
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:08,435
Go for it.

441
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:13,199
I'm scared.

442
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:16,772
But you're here...

443
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,432
cause you're crazy about him.

444
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,485
I get it, okay? I mean,

445
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:24,045
what's not to love?

446
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:25,558
Listen.

447
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,966
Take it from someone
who's been around a long time.

448
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:31,619
When it's real, you can't walk away.

449
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:43,174
It was really nice meeting you.

450
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:54,786
Yep, I drank yours.

451
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
Sorry.

452
00:30:58,688 --> 00:30:59,688
Thank you.

453
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,010
You weren't supposed
to be listening.

454
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,481
I was feeling epic.

455
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,783
Whatever.

456
00:31:21,622 --> 00:31:23,122
Keep this contained.

457
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:24,903
That's not all.

458
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:38,938
Did you see what did this?

459
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:45,152
Tell me everything you saw.

460
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,711
{\PUB}You came.

461
00:32:03,817 --> 00:32:07,550
{\pos(150,268)}I couldn't miss your hundredth and...
whatever birthday.

462
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:22,868
I slim... I'm slipped.

463
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:25,454
I slipped.

464
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:26,779
Hammered, huh?

465
00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:29,135
Well...

466
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:32,492
a very nice but not handsome

467
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,160
bartender
was very kind to me tonight.

468
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,014
Unlike the rest
of the global humanverse.

469
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,679
Are those curly fries?

470
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:47,469
Coffee for the drunk girl.

471
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:52,203
Bad night, huh?

472
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:54,638
Baddest.

473
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,192
Am I shallow?

474
00:32:58,864 --> 00:33:01,562
- Is that a trick question?
- I don't mean to be.

475
00:33:02,654 --> 00:33:03,814
I wanna be deep.

476
00:33:04,306 --> 00:33:06,062
I wanna be, like...

477
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:07,782
the abyss deep.

478
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,990
No offense, Care, but
deep's really not your scene.

479
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:16,888
That's true.

480
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,510
I'm shallow.

481
00:33:20,673 --> 00:33:22,373
I am worse than shallow.

482
00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:24,984
I'm a kiddie pool.

483
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,720
You're not a kiddie pool.

484
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,090
You're not a kiddie pool.

485
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:33,167
Can I just go home?

486
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:36,822
I'll take you. Come on.

487
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,733
You're okay. She's all right.
Hold still. Hold still.

488
00:33:57,847 --> 00:33:59,047
What happened?

489
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:01,049
- Is she okay?
- Like you care.

490
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,082
- She's drunk?
- As a skunk.

491
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:05,756
Are they serving you in there?

492
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:09,879
I'll take her home. It's on my way.
I haven't been drinking.

493
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,675
I would appreciate that, Matt.
Thank you.

494
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:15,277
You and I will discuss this later.

495
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:16,452
Can't wait.

496
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,927
Don't let anybody else leave.

497
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,709
All right, the shots are a bribe.
I need you to answer a question.

498
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,250
What are you really doing
in Mystic Falls?

499
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,616
Have you tried the Brittle?
It wins awards.

500
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,934
Cut the crap.

501
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,958
I have a diabolical master plan.

502
00:34:48,312 --> 00:34:49,362
What is it?

503
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:52,772
Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be
very diabolical, would it?

504
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,750
Look around.
Let me know if you see him.

505
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,829
What are you doing?

506
00:35:32,954 --> 00:35:36,054
Thank you for the vervain.
Now if you'll excuse me.

507
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:43,235
What is it?

508
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:48,334
Excuse me. Sorry.

509
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:53,777
Can't go out this way.

510
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:31,896
Why?

511
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:33,867
It's part of the plan.

512
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,374
You okay?

513
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:53,435
Thank you.

514
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,264
Get it in the car quickly.

515
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,257
{\PUB}Lady, I checked everyone's ID.

516
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:05,982
Apparently you didn't.

517
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:14,551
Pretty handy with that stake.

518
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:17,312
{\pos(150,268)}It just... reflex. I guess the

519
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,244
{\pos(150,268)}adrenaline kicked in.

520
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,419
This nightmare is finally over.

521
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:25,714
Caught a lucky break with that witness.
Without her, you wouldn't have been

522
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,339
- able to ID the vampire.
- Very lucky.

523
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:32,916
Well, thank you again.

524
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,401
You're welcome.

525
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,802
You gonna be okay?

526
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:13,624
Do you ever feel like there's not

527
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:16,752
a person in the world
that loves you?

528
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:20,464
Life can be a little rough.

529
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:22,616
I just wish...

530
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,302
What?

531
00:38:26,455 --> 00:38:28,005
Wish that life was...

532
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,309
different.

533
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:34,916
Yeah. Me, too.

534
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,155
Please...

535
00:38:48,153 --> 00:38:49,703
don't leave me alone.

536
00:39:14,015 --> 00:39:15,215
He killed her.

537
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,187
He killed Zach.

538
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:19,512
He killed Tanner. He turned Vicki.

539
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:21,233
I have to kill him.

540
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,893
No. You can't do that.

541
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,411
Why are you trying to save him?

542
00:39:25,536 --> 00:39:27,866
He's never gonna change.
Don't you see that?

543
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,383
- He's never gonna change.
- I'm not trying to save him.

544
00:39:30,508 --> 00:39:33,656
I'm trying to save you. You have no
idea what this will do to you. Please.

545
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:36,113
Everywhere that I go,
pain and death follow.

546
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:37,541
Damon follows me.

547
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,709
No more.

548
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:43,255
Please. Please, just talk to me.
Let me be here for you. Talk to me.

549
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,085
You were right to stay away from me.

550
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:10,146
Told you I'd take care of it.

551
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:31,219
Come on. I did this for you
to get them off our trail.

552
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,805
You never do anything
for anyone but yourself.

553
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:42,337
You missed.

554
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:45,569
You saved my life.

555
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,027
I'm sparing yours.

556
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,246
We're even.

557
00:40:50,376 --> 00:40:51,826
And now we're done.

558
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,087
It's coming.
