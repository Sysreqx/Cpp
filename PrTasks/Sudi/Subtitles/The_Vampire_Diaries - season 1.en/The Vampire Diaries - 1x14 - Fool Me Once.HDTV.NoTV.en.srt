"the vampire diaries..."

00:00:01,779 --> 00:00:04,723
For over a century,
I have lived in secret- until now.

3
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:06,737
I know the risk,
but I have to knower.

4
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:08,603
Damon: Elena, she's a
dead ringer for katherine.

5
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:10,780
Our love for katherine
wasn't real, damon.

6
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:12,691
It was real for me.
I'm going to bring her back.

7
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:12,975
There's a tomb
underneath the church.

8
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:14,911
A spell sealed katherine in
that tomb, protecting her.

9
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:16,279
Tell me how to get in the tomb.

10
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,780
The grimoire.
Where is it?

11
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:19,849
Check the journal.
Jonathan gilbert's.

12
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,384
The grimoire. It
w emily's, right?

13
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:22,885
That's what you need
to reverse the spell.

14
00:00:22,886 --> 00:00:24,320
I'll help you.

15
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:26,489
You just couldn't
live without me, huh?

16
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,590
Your eye!

17
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:28,658
Where'd she go?

18
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:30,993
Where'd who go?
Anna.

19
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,198
Elena!

[click]

23
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:52,241
I wouldn't.
[gasps]

24
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:58,014
Don't try to escape.

25
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:00,249
Don't even move.

26
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,193
Do you uerstand?

27
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:05,396
I understand.

28
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:16,708
Seriously?!

29
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:17,709
I told her
not toove!

30
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,977
I did that eye
thing you taught me.

31
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:20,145
You forgot the lesso
about vervain.

32
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:22,147
She takes a vampire
venom, duh!

33
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:23,281
Who are you?
What do you want?

34
00:02:23,282 --> 00:02:25,483
Doesn't matter.

35
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:29,287

37
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,266
Bonnie?

[gasping]

39
00:02:42,902 --> 00:02:45,336

41
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,350
Anna took elena.

42
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:02,453
Yeah, I got that from
your 600 voicemails.

43
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:04,856
Damon, all night long,
every single street in town,

44
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:06,257
I've been searching.

45
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:08,993
What if your blood hasn't
passed out of her system?

46
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:10,662
Well, then at least you
know you'll see her again.

47
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:12,530
Please.

48
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:14,165
What do you know?

49
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,533
You were with anna. You
st know where she's living.

50
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:18,469
Just tell me
where I can find her.

51
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,338
Nope.

52
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,173
You can go.

53
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,475
Really.

54
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:29,581
You know, all I can
remember is hating you.

55
00:03:29,582 --> 00:03:31,783
There might have been a time
when that was different,

56
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:34,619
But your choices have erased
anything good about you.

57
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,858
But see, I also know that youave
just as much reason to hate me.

58
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,827
This all began with me.

59
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:46,264
Katherine got taken away
from you

60
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:48,433
Because me.

61
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:53,638
And I'm sorry.

62
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:57,775
Apology accepted.

63
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:00,845
So please,

64
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,280
Ju tell me what you know.

65
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:03,848
Huh.

66
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,049
It's elena, damon.

67
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,353
If you know something...
Tell me.

68
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:11,522
[sighs]

69
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,593
I mean this sincerely.

70
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:21,432
I ho elena dies.

71
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:29,941
Bonnie.

72
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,609
Elena?

73
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,177
Oh, you're ok!

74
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:35,680
My head...
Come here.

75
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:38,249
Oh, my god! Ben is a-

76
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,286
Shh. [whispering]
they can hear.

77
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,324
I was so stupid!

78
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,660
Oh, he had all
of us fooled.

79
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:50,428
What's going on?
Why are we here?

80
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:54,032
It mt have something to do with
the tomb and emily's spell book.

81
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,099
Spell book?

82
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,401
Damon said that
it could be used

83
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:57,402
To open the tomb.

84
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:59,704
Why didn't I know
about any of this?

85
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,373
I was trying
to keep you out of it,

86
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:04,309
Hoping it would never
come to this.

87
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,044
Come to what?

88
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:07,979
They need a witch...

89
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,182
To break the spell
anlet the vampires out.

90
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:13,484
No way.
I know-

91
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:20,458
You're wasting your time.

92
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,994
I'm not going
to help you.

93
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,966
That's why she's here.

94
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,401
Motivation for you
to behav

95
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:33,538
You know, you shouldn't
be so desperate.

96
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,741
You made it too easy.

97
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:39,310
[elena groaning]
she needs to talk to you.

98
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,579
[grunting]

99
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,649
Elena gilbert.

100
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,052
You really are
katherine's doppelganger.

101
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:50,488
You must have
the salvatore boys reeling.

102
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:51,789
Whare you?

103
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,624
I'm anna.

104
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:57,729
Your brother may have
mentioned me.

105
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,698
I mean, we're, like,
practically dating.

106
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,202
Ten kegs?

107
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:05,503
You know how much damage
we could do with ten kegs?

108
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:06,971
Duke's got it all
hooked up.

109
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,072
Duke's a douche.

110
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:09,774
Yeah, a douche
with ten kegs.

111
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:12,276
Aka, my new best friend.

112
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:14,178
What's the problem,
gilbert?

113
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,980
Don't have one,
lockwood.

114
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:17,482
Yeah, I didn't
think so.

115
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,951
You ever get bored of it?
Of what?

116
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:21,319
Yourself?

117
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:26,124
Keep laughing, buddy.

118
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,059
Hey, jeremy.

119
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,193
Where is elena?

120
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:30,695
I have been texting
heand bonnie

121
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:32,296
All day about
duke's party.

122
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:34,132
Uh, she went somewhere
with stefan.

123
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:37,001
[sighs] I am so not going
to be one of those girls

124
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:38,636
Who disappears just because
she has a new boyfriend.

125
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:40,772
Who is duke?

126
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:42,673
Some guy that graduated
a couple years ago.

127
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:46,110
And he throws a party every
time he comes home from duke.

128
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:48,212
Wait, duke goes to duke?

129
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,581
His real name
is bob or something.

130
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:53,951
He's a total ass.
But he buys the beer.

131
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,887
Maybe you should come.

132
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:58,256
Uh, yeah. -
I don't think so.

133
00:06:58,257 --> 00:07:00,725
No, seriously.
Everyone goes.

134
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:03,494
Even quiet loner
little brothers.

135
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:09,367
Think about it.

136
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,903
Hey!
Hey.

137
00:07:11,904 --> 00:07:13,237
So I have speech.

138
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:15,907
It is fully scripted
and well-rehearsed.

139
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:17,075
Are you ready
foit?

140
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:19,343
You wrote a speech?
Yes.

141
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:20,678
It's a "you kissed me

142
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,747
And I don't want things
to be weird" speech.

143
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,348
It's pre-emptive.

144
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:25,783
[chuckles] pre-emptive.

145
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:29,120
Yeah, you know, in case you
were having second thoughts

146
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:30,421
Or regrets

147
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:31,522
Or were,ike,
ooged out-

148
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:32,523
Ooged, huh?

149
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:33,958
[chuckles]

150
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,793
Can I just get on
with the speech part?

151
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:37,061
Yeah, go for it.

152
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:39,464
So I know that
you don't think

153
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:40,832
That this is going to
work out between us.

154
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,768
I just want to let you knowhat
right here and right now,

155
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:45,803
I'm offering you an out.

156
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:47,171
Like an escape clause.

157
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:49,207
Why are you giving me
an escape clause?

158
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:53,644
I don't want to make assumptions
about what it is we are doing here.

159
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:56,280
Got it.

160
00:07:56,281 --> 00:08:00,084
So, if you would
like to exercise it,

161
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:02,753
Just let me know.

162
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:04,856
I'm good, but thanks.

163
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,292
Ok.

164
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:09,961
Good.

165
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:11,696
Yeah.
So...

166
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:14,465
See you for duke's
tonight. Yeah.

167
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,033
[chuckles]

168
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:20,304
Yes?

169
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:21,672
Hi there.

170
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,407
I'm looking for bonnie.

171
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,042
She's not here.

172
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:26,911
Oh, do you know
when she would

173
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:28,412
Never.

174
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,314
[chuckles]

175
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:32,984
You have quite an opinion
for someone who doesn't know me.

176
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:35,086
You got some nerve knocking
on a bennett witch's door

177
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:36,554
And asking her
for anything.

178
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:38,389
What'd I do?

179
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,258
Spirits talk,
mr. Salvatore,

180
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:42,260
And so does
my granddaughter.

181
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:44,595
You are no friend to us.

182
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:46,397
Now get off
my porch.

183
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:49,700
Step outside and say that.

184
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,008
[groaning]

185
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:00,786
I am not bonnie.

186
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:02,721
You don't want
to mess withe.

187
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:11,897
Bonnie's not going
to open the tomb.

188
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:13,799
Oh, I think
she will.

189
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,268
Do you really want
katherine out that bad?

190
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:18,003
Trust me.

191
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,638
No one I know wants
to see that girl again.

192
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,275
Except damon,
the lovestruck idiot.

193
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,744
Then wt is it?

194
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,413
Or who is it?

195
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:30,449
My mother's in there.

196
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:32,985
Katherine couldn't
help herself.

197
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:35,188
She just had
tooy around

198
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:37,023
With both
of the salvatore brothers.

199
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:39,258
And when she g caught,

200
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,427
So did my mother.

201
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,765
I watched jonathan
gilbert take her away.

202
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:48,100
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:51,671
You really mean that,
don't you?

204
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:53,272
[chuckles]

205
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:56,342
Yeah, I think
wel skip

206
00:09:56,343 --> 00:09:59,045
The dead mom bonding so you
can start serving a purpose.

207
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,013
Which is what?

208
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:02,949
Leverage.

209
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:06,118
This belong to you?
Ah, ah.

210
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:10,256
[dialing]

211
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:11,591
Hmm.

212
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:13,092
Elena, are you ok?

213
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:15,461
She's fine,
for now.

214
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:17,763
Tell me you have the
grimoire and she'll stay fine.

215
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,766
I can get it.

216
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,435
Which means
your brother has it.

217
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:23,803
And I have the witch.

218
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:25,738
So one of you
had bettereet me

219
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:28,040
In the very public
town square in 30 minutes

220
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,342
So we n safely discuss

221
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:31,510
How fun it's going
to be to work together.

222
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,216
Go ahead.

223
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:39,819
Grovel again.
Oh, wait, no.

224
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,188
I don't care.

225
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,527
I'm leaving.

226
00:10:52,232 --> 00:10:54,500
Keep them buttoned down.

227
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:56,435
Compsion won't work.

228
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:58,537
Just use violenc
right.

229
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,172
I got that.

230
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,877
Sit. Behave.

231
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:07,780
You're the key
to this.

232
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,282
Literally.

233
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,751
The one who opens
the door.

234
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:14,654
Tell me, how long
have you been a witch?

235
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:17,523
Is there anything
to drink here?

236
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:19,458
Are you offering?

237
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:23,195
There's water
on the nightstand.

238
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:28,501
Hey. Can I have a sip?

239
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:39,912
Whoa! [gasping]

240
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:44,550
Come back in,
shut the door!

241
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,552
Don't hurt her!

242
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:48,354
Don't make me!

243
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,990
Lock it.

244
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,912
Anna!

245
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:05,180
Hey, what, uh,

246
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:06,915
What happened to you
last night?

247
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,116
Sorry,
I had to leave.

248
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,691
I told your sister
to tell you.

249
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:11,993
Oh, I haven't seen her.

250
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:13,528
Well, I gotta run, so-

251
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:14,830
Hey, do you want to go
to a party tonight?

252
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,398
Do I what?

253
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,599
The guy that's throwing it
is a total douche,

254
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,668
But it's, uh,
it's supposed to be fun.

255
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:21,837
I figured, you know,
safety in numbers.

256
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:24,606
[chuckles] so you're finally
ready to go out with me, are you?

257
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:27,142
It's been a while
since I've been to a party,

258
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:28,710
And I kindwant
to get back out there.

259
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:31,213
And not be such a lor.

260
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:34,149
And, uh, I like you.

261
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,352
You're fun,
and you're also kind of

262
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:41,022
Strange and lurky, but,h,
I guess I like that, too.

263
00:12:41,023 --> 00:12:44,492
So, yeah, you should
come to the party. With me.

264
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:47,996
It's in the woods
by that old cemetery.

265
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,898
Oh.

266
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,733
It's there, huh?

267
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,101
That sounds cool.

268
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:54,903
Uh, I'll meet yo

269
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,472
Oh-ok! Great!

270
00:12:57,473 --> 00:12:59,107
Cool.

271
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:00,642
Ok! [chuckles]

272
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:10,285
Got a hot date,

273
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:13,688
Or are you just planning on
nabbing the entire gilbert family?

274
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:16,258
A party, right next
to the old cemetery.

275
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:17,993
Isn't that nice
of them?

276
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:20,896
Lots of warm bods
for starving vampires.

277
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:23,198
I told you.
I work alone.

278
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:24,633
Yeah, so do I.

279
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:25,867
But you're
minus a witch

280
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,535
And I'm minus
spell book.

281
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:29,437
So what do you say?

282
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,273
Stefan will come after you,
you know that.

283
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:33,742
For messing with elena.

284
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:35,911
Then he won't be too
happy if I kill her

285
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:38,480
When I don't get
what iant.

286
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:40,815
[groans]

287
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:43,451
When do you want
to do this?

288
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:45,020
[exhales]

289
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:48,490
God, it's like 1864
all over again.

290
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:53,261
You salvatores are truly
pathetic when it comes to women.

291
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:55,263
Tonight. After sundown.

292
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,299
Meet at the church.

293
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:04,673
Witches don't have
eternal life, right?

294
00:14:04,674 --> 00:14:07,709
So you guys can die.

295
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,778
Yeah, we can die.

296
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,581
Ah.

297
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:15,583
That sucks.

298
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:17,986
[screaming]

299
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:19,788
Stefan!

300
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,023
Let's get outside.

301
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:24,392
[groaning]

302
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,195
When the sun goes down,

303
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:28,630
Leave town.

304
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,298
If I ever
see you again,

305
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,068
I will kill you.

306
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:36,504
[gasping]

307
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:38,974
[birds chirping]

308
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:41,309
How did you know
where we we?

309
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,512
Many things can
el a witch's power.

310
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:46,715
Worry, anger.

311
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:50,618
After stefan told me that they
had taken you, I had a lot of both.

312
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:55,123
Simple locator spell
was easy after that.

313
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:56,958
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,294
About all of this.

315
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:01,863
Not as sorry
as they're gonna b

316
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:05,166
So what do we do now?

317
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,701
For now, you need
to stay here.

318
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:09,104
A prisoner,
in my own home?

319
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:10,939
I don't think so.

320
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,807
I can't protect you
if you leave the house.

321
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:15,410
We'll protect
ourselves.

322
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:18,913
We need to let him
have katherine back.

323
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:21,182
He's not going to stop
until he gets her.

324
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:22,650
If we help him,
maybe that ends it.

325
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:25,020
No! He doesn't deserve
to get what he wants.

326
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:27,355
What other choice
do we have?

327
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:32,694
Witches being pulled
down by vampire problems.

328
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:35,730
As much as we tried
to do to stay out of it.

329
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,068
I'll open the tomb.

330
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,503
You get
your brother'sirl,

331
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:44,739
And destroy the rest
with fire.

332
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,308
Then this will be
all over.

333
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:49,077
We still have to get
damon to agree.

334
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,278
He already agreed once.

335
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,213
Yeah, and then we
double cross him.

336
00:15:52,214 --> 00:15:53,448
So now he's angr

337
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,884
He's hurt.
There's a difference.

338
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:00,388
I think I know
what I have to do.

339
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:06,294
[chuckles]

340
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:09,597
You've got
to be kidding me.

341
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:13,935
It was stefan.

342
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:16,037
There was nothing
I could-

343
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:18,740
Shut up!
Stop talking.

344
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:23,711
Without the witch,

345
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:27,215
We don't have damon
or the grimoire.

346
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:30,351
Damon's not going
to stop.

347
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:33,855
He'll find a way
to get in.

348
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:37,826
And we're going to be
there when he does.

349
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:50,939
I'm going to have
to change the locks.

350
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,841
Did you stage
a jailbreak?

351
00:16:52,842 --> 00:16:54,742
Stefan.
Oh, brother.

352
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:57,846
Ever the white knight.

353
00:16:57,847 --> 00:17:00,815
I convinced bonnie
to help you.

354
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,517
I doubt that.

355
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:04,385
I'm not going to say
that I'm sorry

356
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:05,920
We got the grimoire
without you last night,

357
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:09,057
Because I'm not, really.

358
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:10,391
Well, at least you're honest.

359
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:12,894
I was protecting
the people I love, damon.

360
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,330
But so were you,

361
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:17,832
In your own,
twisted way.

362
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:18,900
And as hard
as it is to figure,

363
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:20,335
We're all on
the same side,

364
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,803
After the same thing.

365
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:23,638
Not interested.
Yes, you a.

366
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:26,274
Because you were willing
to work with us yesterday.

367
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:29,344
Foole once,
shame on you.

368
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:30,845
Ok, when we were
in atlanta,

369
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:33,581
Why didn't you use
your compulsion on me?

370
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:38,052
Who's to say I didn't?

371
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:40,655
You didn't.

372
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:44,058
I know you didn't.

373
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,494
But you could have.

374
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:50,632
You and I...

375
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,434
We have something.

376
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:57,272
An understanding.

377
00:17:57,273 --> 00:18:00,542
And I know that
my betrayal hurt you,

378
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:02,977
Different from how it is
with you andtefan,

379
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:05,113
But I'm promising you
this now,

380
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:07,749
I ll help you
get katherine back.

381
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,618
[groans]

382
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,754
I wish I could believe you

383
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:19,861
Ask me
if I'm lying now.

384
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,737
No animal will stop,
by the way,

385
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:32,273
No matter what I do.

386
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:36,311
Then we'll deal
with it.

387
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:53,695
I didn't compel you in atlanta
because we were having fun.

388
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:59,234
I wanted it to be real.

389
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:04,906
I'm trusting you.

390
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:09,911
Don't make me regret it.

391
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:25,488
The duke party.
I forgot.

392
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:27,056
I hope they stay
clear of the church.

393
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:28,458
Your hope, n mine.

394
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,725
Matt: Elena, hey.

395
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:32,795
Elena, oh, my god.
Where have you been?

396
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:35,798
Long story,
no time to tell it.

397
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,733
Wasn't talking to you.
Sure you were.

398
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:40,069
We haven't met.
I'm matt.

399
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,104
Matt, there's a reason
we haven't met.

400
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:43,873
You and I are
going that way.

401
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:45,942
Ahhh. I'm sorry,
you guys.

402
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,349
Cleared the debris away.

403
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,785
Set the torches
like you asked.

404
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:58,120
We can get down now.

405
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:00,790
Elena: What is that?

406
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,093
It's everything I need
to destroy them.

407
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:07,096
Are you sure damon
will come back with her?

408
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:09,131
[damon whistles]

409
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:12,635
Brother, witches.

410
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:13,769
Everything ok?

411
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,204
I just want
to get this over with.

412
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:16,839
Are we ready?

413
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,275
I guess so.

414
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:21,277
[all cheering]

415
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:23,279
[rock music playing]

416
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,747
Done!

417
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:26,716
[laughter]

418
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:29,852
Hey, uh,
I'll be right back.

419
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:32,588
Hey, man.

420
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:35,525
Uh, you got any weed?

421
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,260
Wait, you're kidding me,
right?

422
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:40,296
You act like a total dick
every time we cross paths,

423
00:20:40,297 --> 00:20:42,431
And now you want
to party witme?

424
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:44,467
[indistinct] I'm just
asking question.

425
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,435
Dude, I don't geyou, man.

426
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:47,570
It's aarty.

427
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:49,138
You're a partier, ok?

428
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,439
There's no need
to psychoanalyze it.

429
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,874
I don't party anyme.

430
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,043
And even if I did,
it wouldn't be with you.

431
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,445
No problem.

432
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:58,548
Carry on just standing
there, by yourself.

433
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,816
All alone.

434
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,485
The enemy of fun.

435
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:06,055
Do you even have
any friends?

436
00:21:13,764 --> 00:21:16,866
[chuckles]

437
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:18,701
Thank go

438
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:20,870
Weird hello, but ok.

439
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:22,438
What's the matter?

440
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,641
Uh, nothin'.
Nothing, just...

441
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:29,178
It's nothin'.

442
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:31,614
Come on, let walk.

443
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,586
Air.

444
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,754
Earth.

445
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,890
Fire.

446
00:21:40,891 --> 00:21:42,725
Water.

447
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:46,028
That's it,
just water from the tap?

448
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:47,897
As opposed
to what?

449
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:49,599
I just figured maybit
would have to be blessed

450
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,001
Or mystical
or something.

451
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,572
What's that?

452
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:58,608
It's for katherine.

453
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,977
Gotta have something
to get her going.

454
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:03,512
Unless your girl's
offering a vein to tap.

455
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:06,215
[sighs]

456
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:08,951
Admit it-

457
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,554
You can't wait
to get rid of me.

458
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:13,923
[chuckles]

459
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:16,392
I can't wait
to get rid of you.

460
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:18,060
Hmm.

461
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:21,430
You ready?

462
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:23,432
[indistinct chatter]

463
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:26,435
This place is wild.

464
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:27,837
You kinda like
dead people, huh?

465
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:30,406
I'm strange, remember?

466
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,009
You ok?

467
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,645
Yeah, yeah.
Uh...

468
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,913
This place makes me
think about someone.

469
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:39,415
A dead someone?

470
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,817
No, no, just...

471
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,754
Someone I used
to know.

472
00:22:46,189 --> 00:22:47,556
So, uh, hey.
[chuckles]

473
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:50,726
We made it all of, what,
37 minutes in that party?

474
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:53,029
Not your scene?

475
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,731
No, I'm not really su
what my scene is anymore.

476
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:57,500
Hmm.

477
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,935
So what do you say?

478
00:22:59,936 --> 00:23:03,973
You want to be
part of my non-scene?

479
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:07,376
I would happily
be a part of your non-scene,

480
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:11,313
Except, uh,
I'm leaving.

481
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:13,683
Wait, what?

482
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:16,285
Yeah. My mom and I
are moving away.

483
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:18,754
Oh, uh...

484
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:21,924
That's-
that's a bummer.

485
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:25,194
Yeah?
Well, yeah.

486
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,363
So...

487
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,299
Guess this is good-bye.

488
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,836
I guess it is.

489
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:44,847
Anna, your face!

490
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:46,382
It's nothing.

491
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,350
It didn't look like
nothing.

492
00:23:51,455 --> 00:23:53,489
[sighs] you didn't have
to hit him that hard.

493
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,392
Yes, I did.

494
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:59,662
Grab him,
and let's go.

495
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:03,399
I'm taking him
to meet my mother.

496
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,205
Where's your date?

497
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:15,507
Who knows?

498
00:24:15,508 --> 00:24:17,509
Ah, is the honeymoon
over already?

499
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,711
Maybe.

500
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,379
After all that grief you
gave me about liking her.

501
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,114
I figured it would have lasted
longer than five minutes.

502
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:26,284
Look, I just
- I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing.

503
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:29,854
She-she seems like
she might be a little clingy.

504
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:31,389
Well, good.

505
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,824
I need my boy single
anyway.

506

There you are.
Here I am.

Yeah, well, I'm not
drunk enough,

511
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:45,203
So I'm just going
to go get another beer.

512
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:48,940
So...

513
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:50,975
So.

514
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:52,777
I have
another speech.

515
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:54,546
Ok.

The hand thing
with elena,

517
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:59,751
It was lame.

518
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:02,387
Well, I was lame.

519

And he was always
such a jerk to me.

522

And...

523
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:13,565
I wanted to show off that
I was with the good guy.

524
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:17,001
So, anyway,
I was lame.

525
00:25:18,304 --> 00:25:19,704
So...

526
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:22,373
Forgiven?

527
00:25:23,342 --> 00:25:25,410
Yeah, course.

528
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:26,945
Yeah.

What's happening?

531
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:09,520
It worked!

532
00:26:10,556 --> 00:26:12,457
Of course
it worked.

to build.

gasoli, I'll be right back.

You ready?
What?

You think I'm going
to go in there by myself

537
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:28,072
So you can seal me in?
Don't take her in.

I'll bring
the walls down.

You'll bring walls down if
I don't. Yothink I trust you?

As much as I trust you.
Enough!

He needs to know
that you're not going

544

545

567
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:06,604
Why did you
let her go in?

568
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:09,340
Because she isn't
coming out, baby.

gave me what I want.

Where's elena?

What did you do?

Opening the door
didn't remove the seal,

590
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,588
It just opened the door.

What's the sea

592
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:11,925

She can leave.

597

Anna and katherine can't.

598
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:24,972
Damon can't.

599
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:26,406
You weren't even planning
on breaking the spell,

Were you?

00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,277

I ll protect my own.

That's all that matters.

You must have
a taste for it.
