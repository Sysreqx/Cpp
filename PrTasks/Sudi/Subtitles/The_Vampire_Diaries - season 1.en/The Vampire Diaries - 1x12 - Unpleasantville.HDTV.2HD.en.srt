1
00:00:01,064 --> 00:00:02,264
Previouslye on "the vampire diaries"...

2
00:00:02,332 --> 00:00:04,700
For over a century, I have lived in secret,

3
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:07,269
Until now. I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

4
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:09,037
Elena, she's a dead ringer for katherine.

5
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,973
Our love for katherine wasn't real, damon.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,141
I'm gonna bring her back.

7
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,509
I'm anna. Uh, jemy.

8
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:15,544
You know, my grea
t-grandfather actually showed me

9
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:17,079
A journal. He had written all of this

10
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:18,147
Creepy stuff about vampires.

11
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:19,148
Your tur

12
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:20,516
Any sad relationship stories?

13
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,519
Fell in love, married young...

14
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:26,121
Wifeied.

15
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,390
I've never been in your room before.

16
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,691
Elena?

17
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:31,860
Who am I  you?

18
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:32,961
You are not katherine.

19
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:34,196
Why do I look like her?

20
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:36,165
You were adopted.

21
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:50,012
Aah! How you doin' in there?

22
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:54,082
Stefan, who was that man in the road?

23
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,420
I don't know. Do you remember
anything else about him?

24
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:02,424
I wish. I never really saw his face.

25
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:04,092
He was wearing a hoodie.

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,864
All I caremember is that there was
these black boots coming towards me.

27
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:11,600
I brought some vervain

28
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:14,169
For, um-- for you and jenna.

29
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:17,439
And, um, I made this bracelet for jeremy,

30
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:19,107
Few extra on for friends.

31
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,143
You can put it in jewelry,

32
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:24,179
Or you can even put it in food or drink,

33
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:27,583
But as long as it's in you or on you,

34
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,585
A vampire cann control you.

35
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:31,420
Wow. So mucho remember.

36
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:34,756
I know, but there's another vampire in tow

37
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:38,293
So until we find out who
it is and what he wants,

38
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:39,795
We have to be careful.

39
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:51,607
Hey.

40
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:54,610
It's gonna be $22.

41
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,345
Elena, I need the money!

42
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:59,414
Uh, here. Come in. Just put it on the table.

43
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:07,856
Hi.

44
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:11,093
Um, keep the change.

45
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:13,829
Thanks.

46
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:16,064
And you have yourself a good night.

47
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,153
What are you lookin' for, damon?

48
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,221
Not your concern.

49
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:42,190
No, but putting elena in harm's way,

50
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:43,825
That is my concern. Heh heh.

51
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:45,360
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:46,862
I'm talking about atlanta.

53
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:50,098
Oh, yeah. Elena and I haa blast.

54
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:52,934
I get it.

55
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,403
You're just bitter because onof us

56
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,204
Gets to be with the person that we love,

57
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:59,574
And poor katherine is just out of reach.

58
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:01,877
Unless there's anoth way for
you to get into that tomb.

59
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:03,412
Is that what bree said?

60
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,646
You're pathetic when you're fishing.

61
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:06,715
You're transparent when you're deflecting.

62
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:09,718
Don't you have school?

63
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,229
Surprised? It's a good essay.

64
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:24,132
Your thoughts are clear,
and your argument is well laid out.

65
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,967
It's just, uh, you don't actually

66
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:29,004
Think the are vampires in mystic falls.

67
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,773
No. I mean, I think
statistically there's been

68
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,409
More animal attacks, mystious deaths, uh,

69
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:36,878
People gone missing,
more than any other place

70
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:38,347
In the whole commonwealth of virginia.

71
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,482
It's conjecture,

72
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,418
But creative, which is why you got the "a."

73
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:45,354
I just wouldn't get too, uh, caught up

74
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:47,189
In the whole conspiracy theory of it all.

75
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:48,423
Ah, I won't.

76
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,424
All right.

77
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,727
Oh, uh, jeremy,

78
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:53,395
The source that you cited

79
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:57,065
For the 1860s info, uh, jonathan gilbert...

80
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,100
Uh, my ancestor's journal?

81
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,535
I'd really like to see that sometime.

82
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:01,503
Really?

83
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:02,571
A first-person account

84
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:04,940
Of the civil war? That's like, uh,

85
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,708
Porn for a history teacher.

86
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:08,777
You think my essay's creative,

87
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:11,513
Wait till you get a load of this thing.

88
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:14,883
Thank you.

89
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,193
It's so pretty.

90
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:26,495
Thank you.

91
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:28,797
God, it'll go with, like, everythi.

92
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,265
At's the occasion?

93
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,300
No occasion. Just a little friend gift.

94
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:33,235
Lesbian friend necklace?

95
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:35,070
'cause we're freaky like that?

96
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,038
Your friendship is important to me.

97
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:39,474
Why aryou being so mushy?

98
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,077
Because you've been avoiding me,

99
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:43,578
And I wanted you to know that whatever

100
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:46,381
Is going on with you and matt, it's ok.

101
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:50,552
I was gonna talk to you about that.

102
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,653
I was,

103
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:54,222
But there's just not much to say.

104
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,258
We've hung out a couple times.

105
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:59,261
That's it, but...

106
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:02,898
I just feel like we've peed as friends.

107
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,400
This is weird.

108
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:07,235
I shouldn't be talking you about this.

109
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:08,937
It's weird. It's weird, ght?

110
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,305
It's a little weird, but--heh.

111
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:13,608
If it's what you and matt want,
then it's not about me.

112
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,211
But it's all about you.

113
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:19,414
Matt's not over you, and we all know it.

114
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:20,749
I'm with stefan w.

115
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:21,750
Matt understands that.

116
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:23,785
He kno he has to move on.

117
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:32,828
Matt donovan. What do you know?

118
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:34,563
Ben mckittrick. What's up, man?

119
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,897
Rough season, bud.

120
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:37,632
Yeah. It's kind of rd to recover

121
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,468
When you have to forfeit half your games.

122
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:41,736
You gonna be workin' here?

123
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:44,105
Yep, followin' in your footsteps,

124
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:46,775
Minus the ate championship.

125
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:48,543
Well, can't all be football gods.

126
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:49,478
Yeah.

127
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:52,080
So what's the plan? Cook line?

128
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:54,416
Busboy.

129
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,589
I n't believe you're adopted.

130
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,858
I never saw that coming.
And it gets weirder.

131
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,226
I looked at my birth certificate.

132
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:06,561
It lists miranda and grayson
gilbert as my birthparents.

133
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:07,929
None oit makes any sense.

134
00:06:07,997 --> 00:06:09,264
Which is why you should ask jenna.

135
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,200
First of all, the elena I know

136
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,569
Would always want the
real truth, good or bad.

137
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,037
And second of all?

138
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:18,773
You just found out your
boyfriend is a vampire,

139
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:21,943
So unless your birthparents are aliens...

140
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:23,545
How bad could it be?

141
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:26,882
Ah, ok, look, I have to go to the store.

142
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,484
My outfit for the dance is
severely lacking accessories.

143
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:31,386
Ok, I'll pay the bill.

144
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:32,487
Ok. Bye.

145
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:33,989
Bye.

146
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,326
What do you want from me?

147
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:40,595
I think we need a fresh start.

148
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:41,863
You tried to kill me.

149
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:44,733
But I didn't, and if I wanted to,
I would have.

150
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,268
Does that not count for anything?

151
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:48,537
You know, I can start fires with my mind.

152
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:49,804
Fires kill vampires, right?

153
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,009
Just stay the hell away from me.

154
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:56,411
Everything ok over here?

155
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,246
Yeah, we're fine.

156
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:00,949
I wasn't talkin' to you.

157
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:09,491
Heh.

158
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:13,595
Thank you.

159
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,597
Ytime, bonnie.

160
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:17,566
Wait. Yoremember me?

161
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,701
I didn't graduate thatong ago.

162
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:21,436
You're makin' me feel old.

163
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:22,904
Sorry. I didn't--

164
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:27,442
I didn't mean that.
I just-- I didn't know you knew me.

165
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,912
I always know a pretty face.

166
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,525
Hello.

167
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,492
hello, elena.

168
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,861
Hey, who's this?

169
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,997
You hit me with your car.

170
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,733
Is that a new one?

171
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:56,538
You got away from me.

172
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,206
You won't next time.

173
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,172
Why me? What does he want with me,

174
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,740
A-and if he's trying to kill me,

175
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:12,707
Then why call first?

176
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:14,910
That's because we're predators, ena.

177
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:16,144
We hunt. We stalk.

178
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,814
It's often as exciting as the kill.

179
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,350
I want you to take this.

180
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:25,687
This is jeremy's pocket watch.

181
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,788
How did you get it?

182
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,456
I took it from damon,
who took it from logan,

183
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:29,591
Who must have taken it from you.

184
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,259
What happened to it?

185
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,361
Well, it's n just a watch.

186
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,864
It's a-- it's a sort of compass,

187
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,034
But it points to vampires.

188
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,945
Why did my father have it?

189
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,613
Gilberts were one of the founding families,

190
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:54,382
And back in 1864, th were among those

191
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,785
Who sought to eradicate the vampires.

192
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:59,487
The compass was used to find us.

193
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,657
Did you know them?

194
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,460
Yes.

195
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,396
I want you to keep this.

196
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,932
That way, you'll know if
you're ever in danger.

197
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:23,478
I've nevereen you such a mess.

198
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,380
don't talk smack.

199
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:29,417
I mean, I just thought that you
told everyone else what to do.

200
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,486
Well, I do that, too,

201
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:33,588
But if you want something done right,

202
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,724
You gotta do it yourself.

203
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,131
You know, I just like
that we're hanging out.

204
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,466
Who knew--you and me?

205
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,468
Well, who knew yocould be fun?

206
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,039
So what are you wearing to
this dumb dance, anyway?

207
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:53,208
Should we color-coordinate?

208
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,976
Uh, I'm not goin'.

209
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:56,378
Why not?

210
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:59,247
I gotta work, bussin' tables at the grill.

211
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:01,650
Since when are you a busboy?

212
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,486
It's a job.

213
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:07,522
You know, some of us have to work, caroline.

214
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,558
With our mom in and out,
things are tight, so...

215
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,060
I didn't mean it like that.

216
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,829
I just meant that I
didn't know you had a job.

217
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,798
Well, I do.

218
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,367
I gotta go.

219
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:26,775
Hey.

220
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:27,842
How'd it go?

221
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,010
What?

222
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:30,312
The paper.

223
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,513
Oh. I got an "a."

224
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,114
Thanks for the artles. They really helped.

225
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,817
Cool. So what'd he say about the vampir?

226
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,952
Did he believe it?

227
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,721
I don't even believe it.
It's just a paper, anna.

228
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,489
Anyways, I, uh-- I gotta get goin'.

229
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,992
Uh, hey, um...

230
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,561
D-do you wanna do something later, maybe?

231
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:49,931
Uh, sorry. I'm stuck on punch
duty at the school dance.

232
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,866
Oh. How'd you get stuck with that?

233
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,502
Well, I'm failin' english,
so I copped a plea.

234
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,107
Maybe, you know, tomorrow or something.

235
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,912
I'm being pushy again, aren't I?

236
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,247
Heh.

237
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,450
Well, thanks for the help. I'll--

238
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,218
I'll see you around.

239
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:20,161
Spoke to the insurance company.

240
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:22,130
Car's totaled.

241
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,266
You can keep using mine for now.

242
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,901
So you're coming to the dance?

243
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:30,772
Alaric askede to help chaperone.

244
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,913
Why didn't you tell me, jenna?

245
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,984
Your mom was gonna do it eventually.

246
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,053
I never thought I'd have to.

247
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,155
If my mom were here right now

248
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:50,225
And I asked, she'd tell me the truth.

249
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:57,732
Your dad was about to
leave the office one night

250
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,235
When this girl showed up.

251
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:04,939
She was 16, a runaway,
and about to give birth.

252
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:09,844
He delivered her baby,
and he gave her a place to stay,

253
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:12,347
But a few days later, she disappeared.

254
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,884
And there you were.

255
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:19,087
Your parents were trying
so hard to have a baby.

256
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,688
I-it just wasn'tappening.

257
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:25,126
All miranda ever wanted was to be a mom.

258
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:28,963
Well, why were my parents'
names on the birth certicate?

259
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,632
Your dad was a doctor, elena.

260
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,000
He took care of it.

261
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:35,570
They didn't wanna lose you,
so they kept it quiet,

262
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:37,372
Told as fepeople as possible,

263
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,275
But if anyone ever wanted proof,
they had documtation.

264
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,012
What else do you know about her?

265
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,113
The girl.

266
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,915
Just her name.

267
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:49,217
Isabelle.

268
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:03,665
You got the hair right.

269
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,103
Why are you bringing me dad's journa

270
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,171
'cause you were looking for it.

271
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,506
D why would I want it?

272
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,241
Gee, I don't know, damon.

273
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:16,644
Maybe you wanna do a little
bit of posthumous bonding.

274
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,547
Go ahead. Enjoy it. Read it.

275
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:23,651
I have. Nowhere in it does it
say anything about katherine

276
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,487
Or the tomb or how to open it.

277
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,554
I'm not surprised.

278
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,723
Man could rely spell his own name.

279
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,724
I'm really sorry

280
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,426
That it won't be of any help with

281
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:35,163
Your diabolical plan, the sequel.

282
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:38,833
You know, I could help you.

283
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,636
You, help me?

284
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:43,204
Aw, I don't know.

285
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:44,939
Seems a little unnatural.

286
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:48,943
I'll do anythingo get you out of this town,

287
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:49,944
Even release katherine.

288
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,379
What about the other 26 vampires?

289
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,081
No, no, no. They can't come.

290
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:55,450
They have to stay put, but katherine,

291
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,051
I would consider that.

292
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,421
What are you doin'? Hmm?

293
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,123
What's your angle?

294
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:04,592
Think about it.

295
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,631
Why would I trust you?

296
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:11,399
See that's your problem, damon.

297
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,968
You apply all of your
shortcomings to everybody else.

298
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:16,704
If history's any indication,

299
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,474
There's only one liar among us.

300
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,522
Hey,enna.

301
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,458
Jenna?

302
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,126
Jeremy?

303
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,588
Stefan's phone. How mai help you?

304
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:41,522
Where is he?

305
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,624
He's on his way to you,

306
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,092
Forgotis phone.

307
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,462
thank god. This compass was spinning.

308
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,064
Stefan must be here. Thank you.

309
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,599
You're welcome.

310
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,170
aah!

311
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,180
Are you ok?

312
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,016
Are you ok?

313
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,917
Ok.

314
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,285
How did he get in?

315
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:18,054
He was invited in.

316
00:16:18,122 --> 00:16:21,157
He posed as a pizza delivery guy last night.

317
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:22,725
Well, he gets points fothat.

318
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:24,293
Did he say what he wanted?

319
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:26,696
No. He was too busy trying to kill me.

320
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:28,831
And you have no idea who this is?

321
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,366
No.

322
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:32,702
Don't look at me like that.

323
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,003
I told you we had company.

324
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:35,772
You think there's more than one?

325
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,540
We don't know.

326
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:43,212
Damon, he was invited in.

327
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,684
Then we go get him tonight.

328
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:50,019
You up for it?

329
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:51,888
What do I have to do?

330
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:53,956
Let your boyfriend take you to the dance.

331
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:55,291
Wel see who shows up.

332
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,160
That's a bad idea.

333
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:58,895
Till we get him, this house isn't safe.

334
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:01,597
For anyone who lives in it.

335
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,201
It's worth a shot.

336
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,904
I'll do it.

337
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:17,346
I'll be with the o of you. I'll be safe.

338
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:51,681
Alaric.

339
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:55,151
Hey, look at you.

340
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,820
I figured I'd stand out
less if I dressed up.

341
00:17:57,888 --> 00:17:59,188
Heh heh. Liar.

342
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:01,457
Ok, I'm a sucker for the decade dance.

343
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,326
I went to school here, you know.

344
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:05,928
They do the sixts and seventies, too, fyi.

345
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:08,064
Oh. Can't wait.

346
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,066
Can I get you a drink?

347
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,635
I hear the punch is real boss.

348
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:14,103
Heh.

349
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,776
Having fun?

350
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:24,547
No, but this took about 2 hours,

351
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:27,216
So I'm at least staying half of that.

352
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:29,218
What's damon doing here?

353
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:34,423
He wanted to come.

354
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:36,592
I promise. He'll behave.

355
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,194
So what is this, like, a threesome now,

356
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:39,428
You and the salvatore brothers?

357
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,531
No, but if I'm gonna be with stefan,

358
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,399
Then I have to learn to tolerate damon.

359
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,067
It's not like I can kill him.

360
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:46,135
There's a thought.

361
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,970
Mmm. I'll help.

362
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:52,408
I'm really starting to
see a change in jeremy.

363
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:53,409
Finally.

364
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:55,745
Uh, losing someone you love so suddenly,

365
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:58,080
The, uh--the trauma and the grief ther

366
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:01,651
Are some of the tougher
things 'll face in life.

367
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:05,221
From someone who knows.

368
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:07,156
You have no idea what happened?

369
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:10,326
That's the hard part, not knowing.

370
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,562
Is it ok to talk about your wife?

371
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,131
Heh. There's not much to talk about.

372
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:19,068
Th must be impossible to deal with,
not having any answers.

373
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:23,906
I'd be lying to you if I told you
it didn't keep me up at night.

374
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:26,576
Wondering why, by who,

375
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:29,378
Maybe one day.

376
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:31,747
Hope so.

377
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,285
Hope so.

378
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:47,263
Hi, bonnie.

379
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:49,465
Wanna dance?

380
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,567
I'm out of here.

381
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,803
Please give me another chance.

382
00:19:56,273 --> 00:19:57,807
Back off, damon.

383
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:02,378
Where did ey go?

384
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:04,180
I don't know.

385
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,915
What'd you say to 'em?

386
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:07,850
I was perfectly polite.

387
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:09,619
Elena...

388
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:12,421
Would you like to dance?

389
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:14,256
I would love to.

390
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,959
May I have is dance?

391
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,544
Shouldn't u guys be able to
sense each other or something?

392
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:58,946
No. Doesn't work that way.

393
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:00,614
See him anywhere?

394
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:02,850
Not unless he has a pompadour.

395
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:06,053
Heh. Wow. Was not one of
the better fashion trends.

396
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:09,022
Come on. I'm sure you
looked great back then.

397
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,023
Are there pictures?

398
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:12,493
No. Burned. Buried.

399
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,629
Seriously, what was it like, the fifties?

400
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:18,699
'cause in my mind,
I have this picture of somewhere

401
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,134
Between "american bandstand," "grease."

402
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,736
It's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes.

403
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:26,573
Well, that and, you know, mccarthyism

404
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,575
And segregation and nuclear arms race.

405
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:30,577
Ok, but there were poodle skirts.

406
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:33,180
There were poodle skirts.

407
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:37,384
You're so teaching me
how to do the hand jive.

408
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:38,852
No. That's not gonna happen.

409
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,087
Ooh!

410
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:57,337
You neglected to mention
this was a theme party.

411
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:58,472
What are you doin' here?

412
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,108
Well, seeing ayou also
neglected to invite me,

413
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:02,876
I took matters into my own hands.

414
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:04,678
You're doin' that thing again.

415
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:05,779
What thing would that be?

416
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:07,481
That thing where you pretend we're dating,

417
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:08,582
Even though we're not.

418
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,919
Oh, you mean stalking. Yeah.

419
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:14,121
Heh. Get over yourself.

420
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:17,558
Come on. I've never been
to a school dance before.

421
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,092
Humor me.

422
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:27,868
Let's sit up there.

423
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:30,237
Be a little more obvious, bonnie.

424
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:32,306
Don't rain on my hot-guy parade.

425
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:34,575
What? It's just a drizzle.

426
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:37,010
Ben mckittrick? Really?

427
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,746
He's hot.

428
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:42,649
He's a washed-up jock who
pours drinks for a living.

429
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:44,718
You could do way better.

430
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:45,953
Y.

431
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,387
What's up?

432
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:07,975
Yeah, I don't recognize you.

433
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:10,277
How'd you get roped into chaperoning?

434
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,946
Alaric saltzman.

435
00:23:13,014 --> 00:23:14,615
I'm the new history teacher.

436
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:18,752
Ah, the, uh, cursed faculty position.

437
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,988
So I've been told.

438
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:23,423
Damon. Salvatore.

439
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:25,392
Salvatore, as in, uh, sfan?

440
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,227
He's my little brother

441
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:30,530
I'm his legal guardian,
hence the chaperoning.

442
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:31,865
I hear he's very bright,

443
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:34,568
Not that I've had a
chance to see for myself.

444
00:23:34,636 --> 00:23:36,937
Well, his attendance
record's a little spotty.

445
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:39,172
Family drama.

446
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,974
Arents?

447
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:43,844
Mm, it's just the two of us now.

448
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,381
You, uh--you live here your whole life?

449
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:48,849
On and off.

450
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,450
Travel a bit.

451
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:52,552
Really? Where?

452
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,187
Around the states?

453
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:58,125
Heh. I'm sorry.

454
00:23:58,192 --> 00:24:00,727
I'm nosy. I--I don't mn to pry.

455
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:03,063
Look, it was nice meeting you.

456
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:04,531
You, too.

457
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,366
Enjoy the rest of the dance.

458
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,578
Tonight was so much better on paper.

459
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:20,514
Ah, you're just feeling sorry for yourself.

460
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:21,848
Go and tk to him.

461
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,417
Be bold and fearless.

462
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:25,485
Yeah, this coming from the girl who's

463
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:26,820
Been eye stalking the bartender.

464
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:29,690
You're right.

465
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,700
Hi.

466
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,168
Twice in one day.

467
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:42,102
Lucky me.

468
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:43,337
I'm proving something to my friend.

469
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:45,072
Oh, yeah? What's that?

470
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:48,675
That you don't have to sit around and
wait for a guy to come up to you.

471
00:24:48,743 --> 00:24:51,044
Does that mean that you're
asking me out on a date?

472
00:24:51,112 --> 00:24:52,879
Does that mean you want me to?

473
00:24:52,947 --> 00:24:54,881
Well, what did you have in mind?

474
00:24:57,652 --> 00:24:58,919
Do you like karaoke?

475
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,487
No.

476
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:05,425
But I would really like
to go on a date with you.

477
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:16,737
Seriously?

478
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:17,871
Is that for me?

479
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:20,540
Do you see anyone else in the vicinity?

480
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:21,708
Do you need something?

481
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:24,344
Are you mad at me or something?

482
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:25,712
No, care. I'm not mad. I--

483
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,580
Well, then why are you being so weird?

484
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:27,881
I'm not. I'm working.

485
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:28,982
You're avoiding.

486
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,984
No. I have a table to clean.

487
00:25:31,052 --> 00:25:33,153
You know, that's the kind of thing

488
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:35,622
That washed-up jocks do to make a living.

489
00:25:42,997 --> 00:25:44,231
You don't go to school here.

490
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:45,866
You know, you don't have to help.

491
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:46,867
Oh, I don't mi.

492
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:48,568
It's fun.

493
00:25:48,636 --> 00:25:50,137
Oh, um, yeah. Before I forget,

494
00:25:50,204 --> 00:25:51,872
Can I borrow your anctor's journal?

495
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:52,939
Why?

496
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:54,074
You said I could read it.

497
00:25:54,142 --> 00:25:56,743
Uh, I don't have it.

498
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:59,346
Oh. Ll, obviously you didn't bring it here,

499
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:01,481
Uh, but I can walk you home.

500
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:03,283
No. I mean, I gave it to my history teacher.

501
00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:05,919
Wait. Why did you give it to him?

502
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:07,587
Because he wanted to read it.

503
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:10,123
You know, you shouldn't be
giving that to just anybody.

504
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:11,591
But I should give it to you?

505
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:13,927
Loan. Loan it to me.

506
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:15,762
Well, I loaned it to mr. Saltzman.

507
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,098
Maybe he's in his classroom.
We can get it back.

508
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:21,068
What's the big deal with the stupid journal?

509
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:24,671
Your eye.

510
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:28,108
Um, there's something in it.

511
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:30,010
Forget it. I gotta go.

512
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:42,689
Maybe he's not gonna show.

513
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,692
You mean we did all this
dancing for nothing?

514
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,328
Ahh. The horror.

515
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:49,830
I'm really sorry for all this.

516
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:50,931
It's my choice.

517
00:26:50,998 --> 00:26:52,232
I decided to be here.

518
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,700
I officially signed up for it,

519
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:57,037
So I don't wanna hear
you apologizing anymore.

520
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:03,243
Show me how it's done in the fifties.

521
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:05,078
Uh, no.

522
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:06,847
Come on. One move?

523
00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:22,395
Now you remember that,

524
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:24,731
Because it's never gonna happen again.

525
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,917
What a you doin' here?

526
00:27:43,985 --> 00:27:46,953
Trying to get the journal,
as in sticking to the plan,

527
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:48,155
Something you're not doing.

528
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:49,589
leave thgirl alone.

529
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:51,191
I like her.

530
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:52,626
She looks like katherine.

531
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:53,693
She's not katherine.

532
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:55,695
Ok, katherine is in the tomb.

533
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:57,297
I know, but until we open that tomb,

534
00:27:57,365 --> 00:27:58,331
I got her to play with.

535
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,432
Dot be stupid.

536
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,767
That girl is with the salvatore brothers.

537
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:02,502
Th don't scare me. They never have.

538
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,305
Please, no. Don't do this.

539
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:06,640
You're gonna ruin everything.

540
00:28:06,707 --> 00:28:08,275
You got noth' to worry about.

541
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:10,544
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

542
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:12,646
You will get what you came for.

543
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:15,182
Just let me have my fun.

544
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:19,920
She looks like katherine.

545
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:43,559
You really can't take him anywhere, can you?

546
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:45,260
Uh, no.

547
00:28:48,365 --> 00:28:50,766
Stefan,

548
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,801
The back corner.

549
00:28:56,406 --> 00:28:58,040
Get damon.

550
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,860
What did I do?

551
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:18,861
Where ise?

552
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:20,496
I was getting a soda,

553
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:22,431
Anthen this guy gave me his hoodie.

554
00:29:30,874 --> 00:29:32,541
hello, elena.

555
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,911
Here's what you're going to do.

556
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:38,881
There's an exit door behind you.

557
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,749
You have 5 seconds.

558
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:43,285
No. Or your brother dies.

559
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:47,823
I can snap his neck so fast I
bet there's not even a witness.

560
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:48,791
Start walking.

561
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:50,726
Don't you dare touch him.

562
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:53,229
Keep walking.

563
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:54,864
Through the door.

564
00:30:41,344 --> 00:30:42,912
Ahh!

565
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:07,837
Yaah!

566
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:11,607
Hey, dickhead.

567
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:14,743
Nobody wants to kill you. Just wanna talk.

568
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,453
Now you feel like talkin'?

569
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,622
Screw you.

570
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,626
Wrong answer.

571
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:32,228
Why are you doing this?

572
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:34,029
Cause it's fun.

573
00:31:37,802 --> 00:31:39,603
What do you want with elena?

574
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:43,139
She looks like katherine.

575
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:47,377
You knew katherine?

576
00:31:47,445 --> 00:31:51,314
Oh. You thought you were the only ones.

577
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:55,118
You don't even remember me.

578
00:31:55,186 --> 00:31:57,554
Tell me how to get in the tomb. Hmm?

579
00:31:57,622 --> 00:31:59,089
No.

580
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:01,625
Uhh!

581
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:08,298
The grimoire. Where is it?

582
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,572
Check the journal. The journal.

583
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:19,442
Jonathan gilbert's.

584
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:25,649
Who else is working with you?

585
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:32,022
Who else is the?

586
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:33,423
No.

587
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:35,725
You're gonna have to kill me.

588
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:03,620
What do we--how are you
gonna find the others now?

589
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:05,288
He had to die.

590
00:33:05,356 --> 00:33:06,756
But...

591
00:33:06,824 --> 00:33:10,927
Elena, he's been inted in.

592
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:19,570
Go. I got this.

593
00:33:30,148 --> 00:33:32,383
y.

594
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:33,684
What were you doing?

595
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:35,686
Looking for ms. Hilden.

596
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:37,822
Why are you in mystic falls?

597
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:39,123
I got a job as a teacher.

598
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:41,125
Do you know what I am?
You're my student's brother.

599
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:43,027
Is everything you're telling me the truth?

600
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:44,028
Yes.

601
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:46,731
Then forget we had this conversation.

602
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:06,858
There's no way that idiot was workin' alone.

603
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:09,427
You are.

604
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:12,430
So the grimoire...

605
00:34:12,498 --> 00:34:14,165
That was emily's, right?

606
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:16,935
That's what you need to reverse the spell.

607
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:19,470
When the founding families burned her,
they took her things,

608
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:22,373
And you were hoping that dad's
journal would tell you where it is.

609
00:34:23,442 --> 00:34:26,444
Look at u puttin' the pieces together.

610
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:28,613
Good for you.

611
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:30,248
I was half-right.

612
00:34:30,316 --> 00:34:32,216
Well, it's out there now.

613
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:34,986
Let the games begin.

614
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:37,088
My offer still stands.

615
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:39,457
Yeah, with some hidden caveats, no dou.

616
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,326
No. Nothing hidden about it.

617
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:42,527
No lies. No deception.

618
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:45,163
I'm there when you open up that tomb,

619
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,699
You and katherine go,

620
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:49,567
And the other 26 vampires die.

621
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:51,803
If I agree I'll help you.

622
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,905
Why should I trust you?
Because I'm your brother.

623
00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:55,340
No, that's not gonna cut it.

624
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:57,175
Because I want you gone.

625
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,584
Ok.

626
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:13,925
Looki said something stupid.

627
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:17,762
I'm sorry, but I wasn't
even taing about you.

628
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,831
Yes, you were, caroline.

629
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:22,200
Ben could easily be .

630
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:23,134
We're just alike.

631
00:35:23,202 --> 00:35:24,235
That's not true.

632
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:26,204
Are you seriouy mad about this?

633
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,906
Matt, you know me.

634
00:35:28,974 --> 00:35:31,042
Ok, I say stupid things without thinking,

635
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,245
And then I have to apologize
and take it back, and...

636
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:37,582
I'm a terrible, awful person,
but I'm rking on it.

637
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,418
Look, can we just not do this right now?

638
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:42,720
Ok.

639
00:35:42,788 --> 00:35:44,922
When do you get off?

640
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:46,891
Look, this thing we've got,

641
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,726
It's nice, and it feels really good,

642
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:50,828
And I know you wna take the next step.

643
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:51,996
How do you know that?

644
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:53,364
Have you even asked me?

645
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:56,868
I'm--I'm not over elena.

646
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:02,073
I mean, I don't know if I am,
but if we go there,

647
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:05,209
Then it could mess things up,
and we might lose this,

648
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:08,546
And this is the only good thi
I've got going for me right now.

649
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:10,815
So if it doesn't work,
I'll just disappoint you

650
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:13,317
And hurt you, and I don't wanna do that.

651
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,089
Well, big problem, matt,

652
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:21,092
Because you took the next
step all by yourself,

653
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,294
And you played the whole
thing out in your head,

654
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:26,097
And you decided to bail
before even giving it a shot.

655
00:36:26,165 --> 00:36:28,733
So this really great thing that we have,

656
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,635
Don't worry about losing it,

657
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:32,670
'cause it's already gone.

658
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:41,813
Thank you.

659
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
I needed that.

660
00:36:42,948 --> 00:36:44,549
Well, thank you for--for coming.

661
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:45,883
I--I really appreciate it.

662
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:48,086
You made the evening much more...

663
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:52,590
Well, you made it, period.

664
00:36:52,658 --> 00:36:53,958
I'm glad I could help.

665
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:57,061
And thank you for puttinup
with all that wife talk.

666
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:58,496
I--I gotta stop doin' that.

667
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:01,199
It doesn't bode well for dating.

668
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:04,802
Is that what this was, a date?

669
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,337
No, definitely not a date.

670
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:07,338
Oh.

671
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:08,506
But Friday...

672
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:11,542
You, me, and dinner and a movie,

673
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,444
That could be a date.

674
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:15,813
How 'bout it?

675
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:17,115
Works for me.

676
00:37:17,182 --> 00:37:18,316
Heh.

677
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:21,486
Uh, you can talk about
your wife all you want.

678
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:23,855
It's gonna take time to heal.

679
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:25,590
We should just be ourselves.

680
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:29,360
Still, I think I'll keep the
isabelle talk to a minimum.

681
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:30,995
Isabelle?

682
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:32,530
Yeah. That was her name.

683
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:34,766
Where was isabelle from?

684
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:38,169
Virginia. I mean, not too-
-not too far from here, actually.

685
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,877
Caroline!

686
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:47,378
Care, get in the truck.

687
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:54,585
What?

688
00:38:03,462 --> 00:38:05,630
This'll never work.

689
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:18,709
Doin' ok?

690
00:38:22,815 --> 00:38:25,183
Is it weird if I say yes?

691
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,184
Is it true?

692
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:28,486
I should feel more upset

693
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:30,822
Or scared or something, but I...

694
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:32,990
Feel kind of exhilarated.

695
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:35,760
It's the adrenaline.

696
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:37,261
You'll crash soon enough.

697
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:40,031
Yeah, I gus.

698
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:42,333
I fought back tonight.

699
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:43,334
It felt good.

700
00:38:43,402 --> 00:38:45,369
I wish you didn't have to fight at all.

701
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:47,471
Still...

702
00:38:51,844 --> 00:38:53,477
I need to tell you something,

703
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:56,814
And I don't know how
you're gonna feel about it.

704
00:38:58,116 --> 00:38:59,283
What?

705
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:04,222
I told damon that I'd help
him get into that tomb

706
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:05,890
To get katherine back.

707
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,491
But it was a lie.

708
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:10,828
I let him believe that he could trust me.

709
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:15,266
Well, then why would you be
worried about telling me?

710
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:17,101
Because he can be very persuasive,

711
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:20,571
And you two have bonded lately.

712
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,875
hat doesn't mean I trust him.

713
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:28,346
It's gonna take a lot more than
just a road trip and a rescue

714
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:32,083
For me to forget who damon
is and everytng he's done.

715
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:35,553
I don't wanna be his enemy, elena,

716
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:37,889
But I can't let him do it.

717
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:39,190
Then don't,

718
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:42,193
And I'll help you, whatever it takes.

719
00:39:43,629 --> 00:39:45,196
Ok?

720
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:47,965
Ok.

721
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:51,402
Come here.

722
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:26,404
Don't sneak up on me.

723
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:29,040
You love it.

724
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:32,677
Where's noah?

725
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:34,378
His obsession got the best of him,

726
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:35,813
And so did the salvatore brothers.

727
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:37,181
They killed him?

728
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:38,449
Tortured and staked.

729
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:40,217
You're not very upset.

730
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:41,552
I warned him, ben,

731
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,587
And he was just gonna
screw everythingp anyway.

732
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:45,890
Let's be honest. He wasn't exactlan asset.

733
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,492
How'd you do?

734
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,494
Oh, the witch is totally crushing on me.

735
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:52,496
Did you get the journal?

736
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:56,767
No, but I know where it is, and I'll get it.
