Previously on
"the Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:04,016
For over a century,
I have lived in secret.

3
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:06,051
Until now. I know the risk.

4
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:07,119
But I have to know her

5
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:09,121
Elena... she's a dead
ringer for Katherine.

6
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:10,923
I want you all to myself.

7
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,858
Just as he wants me, but I'm the one.

8
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:14,526
Who gets to make all the rules.

9
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:15,961
Go get the sheriff. We have a vampire.

10
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:17,162
No. Don't take her!

11
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,564
You'll be killed along with them.

12
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,332
Then let me be killed.

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,800
Damn it. We'll get her back.

14
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:23,402
Don't you think that you've done enough?

15
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,970
Stefan's still
drinking human blood.

16
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:26,405
Aah! Stefan!

17
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:27,406
Stefan.

18
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:29,475
Blood brings out what's inside of me.

19
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,310
I'm not gonna give up on you, Stefan.

20
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:33,979
I believe in you. Stop! Stop!

21
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:36,248
Stop! I'm so sorry.

22
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:39,751
It's OK. You're gonna be OK.

23
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,214
Uhh.

24
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:19,057
We have to get to the
church. They're waiting.

25
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,693
Circle around that
way. I'll distract them.

26
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:23,128
Go.

27
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:26,999
Over here!

28
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,600
There's another one! Quick!

29
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:30,402
Help me!

30
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,204
Arm yourselves.

31
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:42,748
Uhh!

32
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,253
We don't have long.

33
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:50,622
Katherine.

34
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,191
Katherine.

35
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:04,603
We're gonna get you out of here.

36
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:08,207
Damon, hurry. Hurry.

37
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,844
Aah!

38
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:14,680
No!

39
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:17,816
No.

40
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:24,957
Damon. Oh...

41
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:29,695
Come on. Let's go.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,334
Uhh!

43
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,683
Stefan.

44
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:57,656
Stefan.

45
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:02,227
I love you, Stefan.

47
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:54,212
It's so hard to see
him locked up like this.

48
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,114
You're the one who locked him up.

49
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:57,683
You helped.

50
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,018
I couldn't have him running
around chewing on people.

51
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,721
While the town was looking
for vampires, now, could I?

52
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,856
It had nothing to do with
you actually caring about him.

53
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:07,492
Your thing, not mine.

54
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:56,141
Katherine had me make
that for you weeks ago.

55
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,977
- Where am I? 
- The quarry just north of town.

56
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,813
My brother and I brought
you here last night.

57
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:04,716
We found you dead in the woods.

58
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,785
Where's Damon?

59
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,029
Am I... am I a... not yet.

60
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:20,065
You're in transition.

61
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,600
But how? I...

62
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:24,136
You had Katherine's blood
in your system when you died.

63
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:25,771
No. I never...

64
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:28,874
She's been compelling you to
drink it for weeks, Stefan.

65
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:32,644
And Damon?

66
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,880
No compulsion was necessary.

67
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,783
He drank from her willingly.

68
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:02,974
I woke up last night. I
didn't know where I was.

69
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:04,976
I went to the church.

70
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:07,913
And I watched them drag her inside.

71
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,850
Then they set fire to it.

72
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,086
And the whole church went up into flames.

73
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:20,992
They killed her, Stefan.

74
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,931
She's gone.

75
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:33,338
Did you ever
figure out what that is?

76
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:35,574
Nope. Whatever it is, it doesn't work.

77
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:38,009
Pearl didn't say anything else about it?

78
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,145
She thought she was
stealing his vampire compass,

79
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,147
but it was a pocket watch.

80
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:45,517
That Johnathan Gilbert
was a crazy scientist.

81
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,820
Have you spoken to your uncle lately?

82
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:51,323
I've been avoiding him, actually.

83
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,758
That, and I've been here most nights.

84
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:55,894
So, you'll be here again tonight?

85
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,762
Is that a problem?

86
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,364
Yes.

87
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:01,132
You're a complete nuisance.

88
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:03,468
Heh. See you later.

89
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:15,447
Hey. Surprise.

90
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:17,282
What are you doing here?

91
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,651
Picking up this.

92
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,354
A class schedule?

93
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,023
Starting tomorrow, I'm
officially a student here.

94
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,925
You're kidding me, right?

95
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:30,462
No. I finally beat my mom down. Heh.

96
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,464
But why would you want to go 
to high school?

97
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,299
It blows.

98
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,669
Do I really need to answer that?

99
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,542
You'd suffer through all
this just to hang out with me?

100
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:45,043
Yeah.

101
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,778
I would.

102
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:48,980
That's, um...

103
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,949
Stupid? Pathetic?

104
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:53,184
Old lurky me?

105
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:55,420
It's awesome.

106
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,090
It's awesome.

107
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,367
Brought you something to eat...

108
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:12,237
100% Stefan diet approved.

109
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:15,040
You know what will
happen if you don't eat.

110
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:17,409
You'll get all rotting and crusty.

111
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:18,710
I'm not hungry.

112
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:20,312
Of course you are.

113
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:22,447
We're eternally hungry. Take it.

114
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:26,785
The human blood should be gone by now.

115
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:28,653
You want to explain why
you're still in here.

116
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,422
Feeling sorry for yourself?

117
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:33,692
Come on. Drink up.

118
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,569
Fine. Starve.

119
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:46,304
What do I care?

120
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:51,443
Hello?

121
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,178
Hey, it's Alaric Saltzman.

122
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:54,713
Before I hang up, how
did you get this number?

123
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,781
Ah, it's a mystery. 
Listen, I've, uh,

124
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:59,017
been doing some digging on Elena's uncle.

125
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:01,286
You interested? What kind of digging?

126
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,355
I've got an old friend from Duke.

127
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:05,256
Who studied criminology
when we were there together.

128
00:09:05,324 --> 00:09:07,993
Let's just say he's become
a very proficient digger.

129
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,928
Well, did he find anything, by chance?

130
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:12,731
Well, I had him run a track
on John's cell records.

131
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,399
He was getting a call from a number...

132
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,468
The same number that
Elena dialed to get Isobel.

133
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:18,169
And then the number was disconnected.

134
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:20,639
- Isobel knows John. 
- Whatever. We knew that.

135
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:22,974
Right. Well, after that, he started
getting calls from a new number.

136
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:24,643
And I had my friend run a geotrack.

137
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,245
Got the address. It's...

138
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,247
It's an apartment in Grove Hill.

139
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:31,316
Isobel's in Grove Hill?

140
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:33,585
I don't know. I thought we could
take a look and see what we find.

141
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,186
Perfect. Give me the address.

142
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:37,956
Oh, so you can go without
me? No. I don't think so.

143
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:39,724
I'm not going with you.
You tried to kill me.

144
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,226
Yeah, well, you did kill me.

145
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,796
Hold on. What?

146
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,399
I'm just grabbing some clothes,
and then I'll be right over.

147
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:49,434
- How's Stefan? 
- Extra broody.

148
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:50,769
Hold on.

149
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:52,504
You drive. Pick me up in an hour.

150
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:53,938
Done.

151
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:58,810
He won't eat anything.

152
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:01,179
He has to ea what's his favorite...

153
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:02,847
Kind of, um...

154
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:05,116
His favorite kind of what?

155
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,118
Type of animal blood that he prefers?

156
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:08,653
Ew. Gross.

157
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,522
Heh. Your joking doesn't help.

158
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,090
Helps me. Now, hurry up.

159
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:14,592
I can't baby-sit all
night. I have things to do.

160
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,261
I would say, "drop dead," but...

161
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,762
Ha ha.

162
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,031
Stefan likes...

163
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,533
Puppy blood...

164
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,369
Little golden retriever
puppies with cute, fluffy ears.

165
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:26,171
That's his favorite.

166
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:34,946
Sorry.

167
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,648
Uncle John.

168
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,616
I didn't see you there.

169
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:42,020
I thought we could talk. We
haven't had a chance to catch up.

170
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:45,356
I'm actually just heading out, so...

171
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:48,326
Well, it won't take long.

172
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:51,296
What did you want to talk about?

173
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,331
Well...

174
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,166
I know you know.

175
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:56,868
Know what?

176
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:59,003
It's really silly to keep pretending.

177
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:01,639
What do you think your mother would say.

178
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:04,843
If she knew you were dating a vampire?

179
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,780
Which mother?

180
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:27,332
I bet Johnathan Gilbert
has told father by now.

181
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,968
Wonder how he took the
news that we're dead.

182
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:32,604
As if he cares. He betrayed us.

183
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,606
He thought he was protecting us, Damon.

184
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,008
He thought he was protecting this town.

185
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:38,143
God.

186
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,245
This sun hurts my eyes.

187
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:42,781
It's part of it.

188
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:44,649
The muscle aches, the sick feeling...

189
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,685
Emily says it's our
bods pushing us to feed,

190
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:50,255
to complete the transition.

191
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:52,757
That's not gonna happen.

192
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,226
Is that your choice, then?

193
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:56,761
To die instead?

194
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,663
Isn't it yours?

195
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:02,333
This was all to be with Katherine.

196
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,068
But she's gone.

197
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:06,437
I want it over.

198
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,609
How you feelin'?

199
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,212
Damon says you need to drink that.

200
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:17,882
You need it, Stefan.

201
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,717
Can't survive without it.

202
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:22,620
- I don't want to survive. 
- What?

203
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,924
- No, don't say that. 
- I'm sorry, Elena.

204
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:27,458
No more.

205
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:31,396
After what I've done, it has to end.

206
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:34,299
I just want it over.

207
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:40,716
He's just being dramatic.

208
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:42,317
He's not gonna starve himself.

209
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:43,819
Why would he say that?

210
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:45,320
He feels bad about hurting that girl.

211
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:47,589
It's a very typical step of martyr stuff.

212
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:49,357
- It will pass. 
- Will it?

213
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:52,027
Because he seemed to be in lot of pain.

214
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,229
Yeah. Well, that will
pass, too, once he eats.

215
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:56,465
I didn't mean physical pain.

216
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:58,400
I know what you meant.

217
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:00,969
Look, are you gonna be OK here if run out?

218
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:02,838
I have to go to an
errand with the teacher.

219
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:04,473
The teacher?

220
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,209
Alaric? Are you two friends now?

221
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:09,478
I don't have any friends, Elena.

222
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:12,447
Right.

223
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:14,516
You should, um,

224
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:17,586
you should stay up here. You
shouldn't be down there by yourself.

225
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:19,121
I'll be fine.

226
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:20,889
You know...

227
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:24,459
You're very trusting of
him, given the circumstances.

228
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:27,129
So are you.

229
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:30,132
Otherwise, you wouldn't be leaving.

230
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,368
I won't be long.

231
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:46,681
Hello, Mr. Gilbert.

232
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,917
Pearl. What a pleasure.

233
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:51,720
I must admit, I'm surprised that you came.

234
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:54,856
Jenna tells me that you wanted to discuss
the sale of the building in person.

235
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:57,559
Still, revealing yourself to me
like this, it took quite a risk.

236
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,961
I'm not stupid, Mr. Gilbert.

237
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:02,464
You knew who I was when
you requested the meeting.

238
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,368
So, Damon tells me that
you're looking for the device

239
00:14:06,435 --> 00:14:08,236
I took from Johnathan.

240
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:10,839
I'm sure you realize I have no
intention of giving it to you.

241
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,974
That's why I wanted to meet you.

242
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,010
I'm planning on changing your mind.

243
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:17,145
Really? How so?

244
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:19,481
With my Gilbert charm.

245
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:23,051
I know that you have a weakness for it.

246
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:26,922
May I buy you a drink?

247
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,493
So, your mother was
in love with Johnathan Gilbert,

248
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:33,795
and he betrayed her? Yup.

249
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:35,864
And now my uncle John.

250
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:38,033
Wants this invention-device thing.

251
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,668
That she gave to Damon.

252
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:42,204
That's pretty much it.

253
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:44,439
John mentioned there were
more Gilbert journals.

254
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:47,375
I bet that's how he knows everything.

255
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:49,344
Do we have to talk about ts all night?

256
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:52,214
I've told you everything.

257
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,082
I probably shouldn't have,

258
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,117
'cause that could get us
both in a lot of trouble.

259
00:14:57,954 --> 00:14:59,955
I'm not gonna say anything.

260
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:02,657
Your uncle John wants us dead.

261
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,227
Oh, you don't know that.

262
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:06,995
Yes, I do.

263
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:08,997
He's a hater, Jeremy.

264
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:11,099
Well, I'm not.

265
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,701
No.

266
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:14,769
You're something else entirely.

267
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:17,239
Oh, yeah? What would that be?

268
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:21,243
My weakness.

269
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:52,107
I don't want Jenna to walk in on us.

270
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:54,843
Jenna's in the kitchen.

271
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,645
She just opened the refrigerator.

272
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:59,347
Wait. You can hear that?

273
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:02,384
That is so cool.

274
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,155
This is the one here.

275
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:09,624
The records show is was
paid 3 months in advance.

276
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,293
This is where it gets tricky.

277
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,628
I may or may not be able to get in.

278
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:16,331
Yeah, how does that work? You
always have to be invited in?

279
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,466
By the owner or the person of entitlement.

280
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:21,569
Short-term rentals and hotels
are a bit of a gray area.

281
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:23,538
You kind of gotta play it by ear.

282
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,273
Heh.

283
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:27,876
Could we not kill anyone tonight, please?

284
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:30,779
You mean, you just brought
me along for my company?

285
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:38,486
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

286
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:42,624
Yeah. I'm good.

287
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:46,928
No permanent resident, apparently.

288
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:56,972
Uh, Rick, we have company.

289
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,685
Boys, boys, that's enough.

290
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:12,620
I know you.

291
00:17:13,622 --> 00:17:14,723
Damon?

292
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,558
Your name is Henry. You were in the tomb.

293
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,560
Yes, sir.

294
00:17:18,627 --> 00:17:21,463
What are you doing here?

295
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:40,715
May I offer
you a drink, Mr. Gilbert?

296
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:42,617
Thank you, Mr. Salvatore.

297
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:45,020
This won't take much longer.

298
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:49,624
I want to make sure the
founder's archives are accurate.

299
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:52,594
Be sure you document the loss
of civilian life in the church.

300
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,729
They were hardly civilians, . Salvatore.

301
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:57,399
As far as anyone needs to know, they were.

302
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:59,401
As the record keeper for the council,

303
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:02,404
what you write will be passed
down through generations.

304
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:04,706
Certain details should be
kept only between you and me.

305
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:05,874
For example?

306
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,642
My sons.

307
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,013
They will be remembered the innocent
victims of the battle of willow creek,

308
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:13,782
not for their shame.

309
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:15,483
Certainly, Mr. Salvatore.

310
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:25,427
You know, Damon hasn't
fed me vervain in a while.

311
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:28,263
I could be at those bars
in flash, and you'd be dead.

312
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,198
Yeah, you could.

313
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:32,100
But you won't.

314
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:34,669
Please just go away.

315
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:37,439
I don't want you here.

316
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:45,947
What are you doing?

317
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:47,382
- Get out of here. 
- No.

318
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,517
You're taking a stupid
risk. I could hurt you.

319
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:51,786
Then I'm stupid.

320
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:54,155
You need to drink this.

321
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:57,092
Elena, get out of here,
or you'll regret it.

322
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,494
Drink.

323
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:02,997
I said get out!

324
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
No.

325
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:29,744
So, how do you know John Gilbert?

326
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:32,280
Well, I've known him for years.

327
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:34,782
He's a good friend. How do you know him?

328
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,585
I met him right after
I got out of the tomb.

329
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:39,987
He's been helping me
out. Helping you out how?

330
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:43,057
Adapting. It's a whole new world...

331
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,260
Cars, computers, match.com.

332
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:49,830
There's so much to learn.
He helped me get this place.

333
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,700
So, do you live here alone,

334
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:55,069
or is there someone else here?

335
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:58,639
That's my friend's very...
Passive-aggressive way of asking,

336
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:01,375
uh, do you know a woman named Isobel?

337
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:04,278
Uh, no. No, I don't know an Isobel.

338
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:07,281
I know John. He's my only real friend.

339
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:10,184
He really showed me the
ropes... how to use a microwave,

340
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,686
separate my whites.

341
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,054
What else do you do for him?

342
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:15,389
I help keep an eye on things...
You know, with the others.

343
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:17,525
The others? From the tomb.

344
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,393
They're still pissed at
the founding families.

345
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:20,962
For trying to burn them alive.

346
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,798
I'm cool, but those tomb
boys, they want revenge.

347
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,366
What does John want with them?

348
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,401
He's just keeping an
eye on them, you know?

349
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:29,036
Trying to make sure
they stay out of trouble.

350
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,472
Well, that's John. Heh.
He's such a do-gooder.

351
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:36,310
Heh. That's John now.

352
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:38,679
Oh. Hey, let me talk to him.

353
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,815
All right. Yeah.

354
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,555
Are you gonna answer that?

355
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,891
Am I gonna... answer that?

356
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,830
What's going on?

357
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:00,301
Uhh! Uhh!

358
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:01,669
Aah!

359
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:10,644
"Let's not
not kill anyone tonight."

360
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:13,314
Your words. Just pointing that out.

361
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,951
My apologies.

362
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:18,953
No apologies necessary.

363
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:22,390
So, tell me, Mr. Gilbert, why
should I let you have the device?

364
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:25,092
Because I can help you.
I'm connected around here.

365
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,195
The town council's eating out of
my land. They do whatever I say.

366
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,264
And I know that you just
want to live your life.

367
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,500
Complete with a white picket
fence, and I can help you do that.

368
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,136
But the device doesn't work.
Why would you even want it?

369
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,938
It's a family heirloom.
Call me sentimental.

370
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,408
Johnathan was ahead of his time.

371
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:42,877
I read his journals.
They're very extensive.

372
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,545
He actually wrote about you.

373
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:46,947
You were his one regret.

374
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,985
He loved you, and he hated
himself for what he did to you.

375
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:53,721
- You're lying. 
- No.

376
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,525
On his last days, he
wrote how sorry he was.

377
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:01,328
You were the only woman he ever loved.

378
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:09,437
Good God.

379
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:13,541
You vampires... you're so emotional.

380
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,576
Johnathan Gilbert hated you.

381
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:19,780
His only regret was that he didn't
drive a stake through your heart himself.

382
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,453
- I gave it to Damon. 
- What?

383
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,321
I gave your device to Damon.

384
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,156
Why don't you ask him for it yourself?

385
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:32,593
I'm sure he'd be delighted to give
it to you. And then, Mr. Gilbert,

386
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:34,895
may you rot in hell.

387
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,901
Talk to me, Stefan.

388
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,470
Why are you doing this?

389
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:46,073
I'm making the decision I
should have made years ago.

390
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:48,275
What are you talking about?

391
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:52,813
You have to feed in order
to complete the transition.

392
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:55,516
I know that.

393
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:59,053
It was a choice I shouldn't have made.

394
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:10,564
Dear God.

395
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:13,067
Even in our death, you only feel shame?

396
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:15,436
- You're one of them now. 
- No.

397
00:23:15,504 --> 00:23:17,571
Father, I came to say good-bye.

398
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,640
I watched you die.

399
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,976
You were there when we were shot?

400
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:23,978
I pulled the trigger myself.

401
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:26,347
You killed your own sons?

402
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:29,250
You were both dead to me the
moment you sided with the vampires.

403
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:32,253
I only thank God that your mother isn't
alive to see the disgrace you've become.

404
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,522
I haven't turned yet. I don't want to.

405
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:36,457
I'm going to let myself
die, father. Please.

406
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:38,092
Yes, you are.

407
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:45,533
Uhh!

408
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,835
Father, I didn't mean to.

409
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:50,804
- Get away from me. 
- No, let me help you. Please.

410
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:15,529
Ohh.

411
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:26,407
Ohh.

412
00:24:28,743 --> 00:24:31,178
Uhh. Uhh!

413
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:33,814
Oh, God. What's happening to me?

414
00:24:38,863 --> 00:24:40,931
How can you even look at me right now?

415
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:44,368
You need to be able talk
about these things, Stefan.

416
00:24:44,436 --> 00:24:47,304
I need to hear them.

417
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:49,573
Come upstairs.

418
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:50,974
We can talk about it more,

419
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:53,544
and we'll keep talking
as long as you need.

420
00:24:55,513 --> 00:24:57,848
You're so sure I'm ready.

421
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:07,491
And when you feel the same way...

422
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,793
I'll be upstairs.

423
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:24,775
Find anything yet?

424
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:26,777
No, I looked everywhere. The place is...

425
00:25:26,845 --> 00:25:28,846
The place is clean. Well, I found this.

426
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:30,748
Behind the blood in the fridge.

427
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:35,586
Oh, man, this was a real dead-end.

428
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:37,521
I wouldn't beat myself up over it, man.

429
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:40,190
What did you think you
were gonna find, huh?

430
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:43,494
Isobel with a cigar and slippers?

431
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:49,133
Oh, man. I...

432
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,237
I gotta stop this. I can't...
I can't keep searching for her.

433
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:55,439
Really? After only 2 years?

434
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:57,975
That's actually...

435
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:00,010
Moderately healthy.

436
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:02,713
What are you going on? 146?

437
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:05,616
Well, I figure the 200 mark is
probably a good stopping point.

438
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:10,053
Ahh.

439
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:12,022
I mean, no answer is enough.

440
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,891
I keep thinking I wanna kn why,

441
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,626
when, you know, the precise moment.

442
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:19,229
When my wife decided life
with me wasn't enough.

443
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:23,233
She charmed me, your wife Isobel.

444
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,202
She talked a good game, man.

445
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,071
She was smart. She had
this excitement in her eyes.

446
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:30,440
I probably should have known there
was something different about her,

447
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:32,176
some tie to Katherine.

448
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:34,144
There had to be some
reason I didn't kill her.

449
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:36,180
That's enough, Damon. I
don't wanna hear anymore.

450
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:38,882
I just don't want to
waste any more of my life.

451
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,618
Searching for answers
that I really don't want.

452
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:47,224
I'm through with Isobel. I...

453
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm done with all of this.

454
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:53,063
Yeah.

455
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,876
Hey.

456
00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:07,644
What's the matter?

457
00:27:07,712 --> 00:27:09,813
I need you to pack your
things. We're leaving.

458
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:11,682
What? No.

459
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:14,251
I was wrong to think that
we could make a home here.

460
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,286
It's time for us to move on.

461
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:18,822
But I don't want to
move on. I want to stay.

462
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,357
We can't stay.

463
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:23,093
There's too many people
here who know the truth...

464
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,528
Too much history.

465
00:27:24,596 --> 00:27:26,496
So, what, you're just gonna give up,

466
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:28,332
pack us up, and move us out?

467
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,467
It's not safe here. You know that.

468
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:32,502
Please.

469
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,771
This is about Jeremy.

470
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,340
No. It's about me.

471
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:39,843
Finally getting to
build a life for myself.

472
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:41,378
Please, mama.

473
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:45,515
You gave me my life back. I am
just trying to protect yours.

474
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:49,620
I can't force you.

475
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:52,155
It's your decision.

476
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:01,231
Ugh. God. You're still here?

477
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:04,034
Were you expecting anything else? No.

478
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:05,903
Ahh.

479
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,472
So, how was the "errand"?

480
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,007
Futile.

481
00:28:10,074 --> 00:28:12,009
Although, I think I
witnessed the teacher having.

482
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:13,844
An existential crisis.

483
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:15,112
Has Stefan eaten yet?

484
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,813
I thought you didn't care.

485
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:19,316
Chalk it up to morbid curiosity.

486
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:22,319
I think he's getting there.

487
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:24,888
But he's got a lot of guilt
that he has to deal with.

488
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:28,091
And it doesn't help that
you've spent the last 145 years.

489
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,994
Punishing him for
Katherine getting caught.

490
00:28:31,062 --> 00:28:32,462
This is my fault now?

491
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,364
No, it's no one's fault, Damon.

492
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,067
I'm just... saying you're
not exactly innocent.

493
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:40,871
You've made it your life's
mission to make him miserable.

494
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:45,309
Let me ask you a question.

495
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:47,010
In all this important soul-searching.

496
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:48,979
And cleansing of the
demons of Stefan's past,

497
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:51,248
did you ever manage to
get e rest of the story?

498
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:53,450
He said there was more.

499
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:56,019
Yeah. That's an understatement.

500
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:57,487
Damon...

501
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:59,656
Damon.

502
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:01,692
Tell me.

503
00:29:11,636 --> 00:29:14,871
What are you doing? Who is that?

504
00:29:14,939 --> 00:29:16,873
I brought her for you.

505
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:20,644
She's a gift. Have a seat, please.

506
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:25,983
What have you done, Stefan?

507
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,452
Damon, I've been to see father.

508
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,886
He came at me.

509
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:34,291
I didn't know my own strength.
There was blood everywhere.

510
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,227
He was dying, and the
blood was too strong.

511
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:40,097
I needed it. I had to have it.

512
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:42,766
- You fed. 
- Yes. And it's incredible.

513
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:46,870
My body is exploding
with power, Damon. No.

514
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:49,172
I can hear things from far away.

515
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,776
I can see through the darkness.
I can move, like it's magic.

516
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:55,679
And the guilt, the pain...
Damon, I can turn it off.

517
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:57,347
Like a switch.

518
00:29:57,415 --> 00:30:00,484
Katherine was right. It's a whole
another world out there, Damon.

519
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,086
Katherine is dead, Stefan.

520
00:30:03,154 --> 00:30:05,589
- There's no world without her. 
- No.

521
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:07,324
You can turn that off, too.

522
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:09,393
You don't have to feel that pain anymore.

523
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,794
I don't want it.

524
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:12,929
You're weak. You'll be dead soon.

525
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:14,831
You need this.

526
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:16,933
No. You'll die.

527
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:19,569
No. I can't.

528
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:21,605
Please.

529
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:34,851
I won't let you die.

530
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,253
No. I can't.

531
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,854
Don't fight it.

532
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:41,324
We can do this... together.

533
00:31:15,293 --> 00:31:18,462
From the moment Stefan had
his first taste of human blood,

534
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,363
he was a different person.

535
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,299
I suppose I should thank him.

536
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:24,868
It's been a hell of a ride. Heh.

537
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:28,071
Oh, my God. He said he wanted to die.

538
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:30,974
That's why he wot feed.
Now I understand why, but...

539
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,476
His choice.

540
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:35,946
If he's stupid enough
to make it, so be it.

541
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:40,050
Don't do that. Ok? Don't
pretend like you don't care.

542
00:31:42,153 --> 00:31:44,121
Where are you going?

543
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,159
Hey.

544
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:17,762
It's getting impossible
to sneak up on you.

545
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,664
Nice try, though.

546
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:22,233
Sorry I woke you.

547
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:24,202
That's OK.

548
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,038
You only woke me halfway.

549
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:33,511
So, listen. I...

550
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,913
That feels good.

551
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,767
Good-bye.

552
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:20,358
How do you feel?

553
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:22,360
You were right.

554
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:24,595
It is a whole new world.

555
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:26,931
We can explore it together.

556
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:33,371
You got what you wanted...
You and me for all eternity.

557
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:36,774
But here it is, brother.

558
00:33:36,842 --> 00:33:39,844
I will make it an eternity.

559
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:42,647
Of misery for you.

560
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:45,183
Damon!

561
00:33:56,695 --> 00:33:59,097
You've transitioned.

562
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:02,800
You'd have rather found me dead?

563
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:06,137
Katherine saved my life once. I owed her.

564
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:08,973
That doesn't mean I'd
wish her curse on anyone.

565
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:12,276
It feels more like a gift.

566
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:15,713
- That will change. 
- Why is that?

567
00:34:20,085 --> 00:34:22,019
Because even in death,

568
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:24,388
your heart is pure, Stefan.

569
00:34:24,456 --> 00:34:27,291
I sense that about you.

570
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:31,996
That will be your curse.

571
00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:34,999
Emily, wait.

572
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,743
Stefan.

573
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,217
Damon told me the rest of the story.

574
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:56,220
I thought I might find you here.

575
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:58,556
I should have died that night,

576
00:34:58,624 --> 00:35:02,560
just like I had chosen.

577
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:05,163
I should have let Damon die, too.

578
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,999
But you didn't. And if you die now,

579
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,968
it's not gonna change what happened.

580
00:35:11,036 --> 00:35:15,406
Every single person that's been hurt...

581
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:19,277
Every single life that's
been lost, it's because of me.

582
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:27,018
The night that my parents died...

583
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:31,222
I blew off family night so that
I could go off to some party.

584
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,826
I ended up getting stranded,
and they had to come pick me up.

585
00:35:34,893 --> 00:35:38,362
That's why we ended up in
the car at Wickery bridge.

586
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,132
And that's why they died.

587
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,469
Our actions are what set things in motion.

588
00:35:45,537 --> 00:35:48,506
But we have to live with that.

589
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:54,645
I made a choice, Elena.

590
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:57,849
And because of that choice,
a lot of people were hurt.

591
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:59,684
You also made a choice to stop,

592
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,752
to reject the person
that the blood made you.

593
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,421
- You made a choice to be good, Stefan. 
- No.

594
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:05,556
Please don't do that. That's the person

595
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:07,792
who jumped in the water
to save the family

596
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,794
whose car had driven
off the bridge. Please.

597
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:11,996
Don't make this all OK. That's the person.

598
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:14,799
- Who saved my life.
- You don't understand, Elena.

599
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:17,201
Then tell me. It hurts me.

600
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:20,104
It hurts me, knowing what
I've done, and that pain...

601
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:22,273
That pain is with me all the time.

602
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:25,209
And every day, I think that if I just...

603
00:36:25,277 --> 00:36:28,012
If just give myself over to the blood,

604
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,781
I can make that pain stop.

605
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:33,985
It would be that easy, and
every day, I fight that.

606
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:37,355
And I am so terrified that one day,

607
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:40,124
I'm not gonna want to
fight that anymore, Elena.

608
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,629
And the next time I hurt somebody...

609
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:46,797
It could be you.

610
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:48,666
There will be no next time.

611
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:50,668
You don't know that.

612
00:36:50,736 --> 00:36:53,070
Maybe I don't.

613
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:55,840
But what I do know.

614
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:58,175
Is that you can take this,

615
00:36:58,243 --> 00:37:01,078
throw it in the quarry,
and let the sun rise.

616
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,215
Or you could take this ring and put it on.

617
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,784
And keep fighting.

618
00:37:19,398 --> 00:37:22,033
It's your choice.

619
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,778
Elena.

620
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:11,159
- Thank you, Harper. 
- You're welcome

621
00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:12,961
Annabelle should be back in a minute.

622
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:15,797
You know, you don't have to come
with us if you don't want to.

623
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:17,665
This was never my home, miss pearl.

624
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:19,634
I was just a soldier who was left to die.

625
00:38:19,702 --> 00:38:22,137
You saved me. I'm coming with you.

626
00:38:22,204 --> 00:38:24,439
Let me help you with these.

627
00:38:53,335 --> 00:38:55,770
- I'll be upstairs, OK?
- Ok.

628
00:38:56,872 --> 00:38:59,340
Good night, Damon.

629
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:07,982
- Thank you. 
- No, Stefan, thank you.

630
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,618
You're back on Bambi blood, and
I'm the big badass brother again.

631
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:12,620
All is right in the world.

632
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:14,122
I mean it.

633
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,824
Thank you.

634
00:39:15,891 --> 00:39:18,626
For... helping her take care of me.

635
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:21,696
You brood too much. Everything
on this planet is not your fault.

636
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:23,631
My actions, what I do,
it's not your fault.

637
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,433
I own them. They belong to me.

638
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:27,669
You are not allowed to feel my guilt.

639
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:30,939
Do you feel guilt?

640
00:39:31,006 --> 00:39:32,874
If I wanted to,

641
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:34,876
it's there.

642
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:48,623
Emily waited till after I turned
to tell me she'd been successful.

643
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:50,558
In protecting Katherine with her spell.

644
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:52,827
She didn't want me to know about the tomb.

645
00:39:52,895 --> 00:39:55,096
She thought it would impact my decision.

646
00:39:55,164 --> 00:39:57,499
She didn't want either one of us to turn.

647
00:39:57,566 --> 00:40:00,201
She said it was a curse. Witches...

648
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:02,637
Judgy little things.

649
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,205
Why didn't you tell me?

650
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:06,141
'Cause I didn't want you to know.

651
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,243
'Cause I hated you, and I still do.

652
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:11,212
I know.

653
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,848
But not because you forced me to turn.

654
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,317
Then why?

655
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,057
Because she turned you.

656
00:40:24,393 --> 00:40:27,862
It was just supposed to be me, Stefan...

657
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,564
Just me.

658
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:37,038
I'm back.

659
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:41,509
Oh!

660
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:43,478
Mom! Mama!

661
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:48,883
Uhh!

662
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:51,653
Please don't leave me again.

663
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,822
No. Please wake up. You have to wake up.

664
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,893
No.

665
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:10,405
Sheriff Forbes, John Gilbert.

666
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:12,407
Sorry to call so late.

667
00:41:12,474 --> 00:41:15,243
I have an update about the vampires.

668
00:41:25,054 --> 00:41:27,222
Hello, Rick.

669
00:41:36,065 --> 00:41:38,133
Isobel.
