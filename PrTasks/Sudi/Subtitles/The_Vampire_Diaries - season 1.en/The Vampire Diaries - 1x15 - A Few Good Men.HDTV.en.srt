00:00:01,826 --> 00:00:03,093
<i>Previously On "The Vampire Diaries"...</i>

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,327
For over a century, I have lived in secret,

3
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:07,564
Until now. I know the risk,
But I have to know her.

4
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:09,032
Elena, she's a dead ringer for katherine.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,433
Why do I look like her?

6
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:12,502
You were adopted. This girl showed up.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,804
She was 16 and about to give birth.

8
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:16,940
What else do you know about her?

9
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,242
Just her name, isobel.
My wife isobel spent her life

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,277
Researching paranormal activity in this area.

11
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:22,879
Where's your wife? Damon killed her.

12
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:24,848
There's a tomb underneath the church.

13
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:27,350
The spell sealed katherine
in that tomb, protecting her.

14
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:28,952
I'm gonna bring her back.

15
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,386
She's not here!

16
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:32,021
You knew katherine wasn't in there.

17
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:34,724
She knew where you were, and she didn't care.

18
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:54,210
Jeez! You scared me.

19
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:57,080
Do you know what day it is?

20
00:00:57,148 --> 00:01:02,218
It's Saturday. And what year?

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,124
It's 2010. Are you ok?

22
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:09,459
Thank you.

23
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,196
Wait, what's your name? It's harper, sir.

24
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:15,732
How did you get out here?

25
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:19,435
And why are you dressed like that?

26
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:25,041
You seem like a very nice person.

27
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,845
I'm sorry. Sorry for what?

28
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,376
Hey, bonnie, it's me just checking in,

29
00:02:00,444 --> 00:02:03,913
Seeing how you're doing. We miss you here.

30
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:06,883
Don't let your aunt drive you too crazy.

31
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,852
Come home soon. Love you.

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,487
What are you doin' out here?

33
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:14,290
- It's cold.
- Thinking, writing.

34
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:17,093
The, uh, funeral for bonnie's grandma,

35
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,862
It brought back a lot about mom and dad.

36
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,866
I was wondering. You said that you
would do some digging about them,

37
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:27,070
The adoption. Right.

38
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:30,273
So did you? Dig?

39
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,176
Come on inside.

40
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,713
Your dad kept everything
from his medical practice--

41
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,282
Records, logs, Old appointment books.

42
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,619
I found an entry from
the night you were born.

43
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:45,588
Patient and a birth date. Isobel peterson.

44
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:47,223
Do you think that's her real name?

45
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,224
Pregnant teenage runaway?

46
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,026
Probably not. First name, maybe.

47
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:53,329
But where'd she get peterson?
Classmate? Best friend?

48
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,898
So I binged it.

49
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:58,868
I searched for all the petersons in this area

50
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:01,137
Born the same year as isobel, found 3--

51
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:04,641
2 men and a woman, trudie,

52
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,542
Who lived in grove hill, virginia.

53
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,014
That's not far from here. Well, watch this.

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,887
Isobel.

55
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,128
She was a cheerleader.
Trudie still lives there.

56
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:29,966
This is her address. What about isobel?

57
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:34,504
I couldn't find anything about her.

58
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:43,746
Listen. There's something else.

59
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:47,050
Mr. Saltzman, rick,
His wife was from around here,

60
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:49,719
And her name was also isobel.

61
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:59,228
Wait. "was," as in... She died.

62
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:04,767
Alaric's wife might have been your mother?

63
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:07,503
it can't be true, right?

64
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:11,574
I mean, the coincidence alone is just crazy.

65
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:16,079
I have the address for her friend trudie.

66
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:17,447
You wanna talk to her.

67
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:23,453
I don't know. I... I--I don't know.

68
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,523
If it's true and they are the same person,

69
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,526
That means that my birth mother is dead,

70
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:34,931
And I don't know if I could handle that.

71
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:39,502
Elena, did jenna tell you
anything about alaric's wife?

72
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,938
How she died?

73
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:45,475
Just that she was killed and
the case was never solved.

74
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:49,045
You knew that already?

75
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:55,218
The night at the school when he attacked me,

76
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:58,254
He told me some things about her death.

77
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:01,324
Well-- no, no. It's not possible.

78
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:04,594
The coincidence is-- it's too much.

79
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,529
Now, listen, if you do decide to go

80
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,465
Talk to isobel's friend,
I'll go with you. Ok?

81
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,468
I just don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

82
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:20,376
I should get goin'.

83
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:23,713
I gotta go deal with damon.

84
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:28,684
How's he doing? He's dealing in his own way.

85
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:42,498
How do I taste?

86
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:46,002
Oh, so much better than your friends.

87
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,673
But shh. Don't tell them.
They might get jealous.

88
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:55,845
No. Buzzkill bob.

89
00:05:55,913 --> 00:06:00,450
Greetings. Can we talk?

90
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:03,786
Yeah. Without the tri-delts.

91
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:05,588
Anything you have to say to me,

92
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,723
You can say in front of them.

93
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,460
They're really good at keeping secrets.

94
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:15,364
You're worried about me.
That's nice. Don't be.

95
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:17,800
There's no need. I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?

96
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:21,337
Spent the last 145 years with one goal,

97
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:23,940
Get in that tomb. I succeeded.

98
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,242
Granted, katherine wasn't
in there to be rescued,

99
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,376
But why dwell?

100
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:30,213
No, it's so liberating
not having a master plan,

101
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,116
Because I can do whatever the hell I want.

102
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,519
That's kind of what I'm afraid of.

103
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:39,856
Relax. I haven't killed anyone in-- too long.

104
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,659
Those girls?

105
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:47,230
Will end up in their dorm with headaches,

106
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:51,300
Think they blacked out. Business as usual.

107
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:54,971
Predictable you didn't pull
me over here for a pep talk.

108
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,274
So drink up. Spill it, brother.

109
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,212
There was a woman you may
have known a few years back

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,348
Named isobel in north carolina at duke.

111
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:09,085
You wanna discuss the women in
my past right now? Seriously?

112
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:11,554
You killed her. What's your point?

113
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:14,457
I just--just wanna know if you
remember anything about her.

114
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:17,326
Oh, it's like a needle in a haystack, stefan.

115
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,128
Well, think hard. It's important.

116
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:24,066
Nothing is important, not anymore.

117
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:27,203
Great chat.

118
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:30,506
I have to go and exploit some
women in the name of grief,

119
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:33,809
Which I'm sure you understand.

120
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:37,480
"ttfn," said the tri-delt. Heh.

121
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:45,955
- -
- What?

122
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:48,457
This is boring. I'm bored.

123
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:55,131
But we have this entire house to ourselves.

124
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:57,733
I mean, it's practically a bachelor pad.

125
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:03,105
And... So shouldn't we do something

126
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:06,742
A little bit more bachelor-paddy?

127
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,845
What? Something like this?

128
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:17,119
Something like that. I don't know.

129
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:19,989
This is a pretty good show. Seriously?

130
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:42,345
Oh, god. Not on my couch.

131
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:46,349
Mom. Hey.

132
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:50,186
I don't know. It's just weird, you know,

133
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:52,221
Me being raffled off like a disney cruise.

134
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:55,257
In this town, Fundraising is
like indentured servitude.

135
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:59,395
You don't have a choice.
Besides, you're a bachelor,

136
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:01,030
And you're eligible, so there you go.

137
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:03,733
Here. Let me help you with this.

138
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:20,016
Oh, god. I can't believe I'm gonna do this.

139
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,017
What?

140
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,352
I am totally gonna ruin this moment,

141
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,655
But I--I have to tell you.

142
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:27,923
Elena recently found out she was adopted,

143
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,559
And she's been looking
for her birth mother...

144
00:09:30,627 --> 00:09:35,665
Whose name was isobel. Isobel? Like my wife?

145
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:38,501
Isobel never had a baby. Are you sure?

146
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:39,869
Not before you were together?

147
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:42,104
Nope. No way.

148
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:52,615
This is elena's birth mother.

149
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:03,292
Ah, she, uh-- She never told me.

150
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:08,964
I, uh-- I'm gonna go.

151
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:11,867
Yeah, I'm gonna-- gonna go.

152
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:40,262
Trudie? Tru-trudie peterson?

153
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,598
Yes. Uh, my name is elena gilbert.

154
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:46,469
I wanted to talk to you
about isobel flemming.

155
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:48,938
Well, I haven't heard that name in years.

156
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,340
How do you know her?

157
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:56,011
I think that, um, well...

158
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,483
Do you know if she had a baby
that she gave up for adoption?

159
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,857
My god. You're her daughter.

160
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:14,663
I was just gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

161
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,235
Sure. Uh, the kitchen's this way.

162
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,071
I wasn't gonna come. I didn't think I was,

163
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:34,340
But I was driving, and I hit this stoplight,

164
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:37,710
And it made me think
about when I was learning

165
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:40,579
How to drive and then my
mom would always warn me

166
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:42,715
About this blind turn on the left-hand side,

167
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:45,351
And then I was thinking about my mom, and--

168
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,921
I had your address. I'm sorry for barging in.

169
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:53,025
It's no problem. Just a surprise, though.

170
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,594
I haven't thought about isobel in years.

171
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:56,995
When was the last time you saw her?

172
00:11:57,063 --> 00:12:02,000
About 17 years ago,
When she left to go have you.

173
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:06,972
We kept in touch for a while, But,
well, you know, people drift apart.

174
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,041
And you don't know where she ended up?

175
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:10,676
She was in florida for a while.

176
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:13,746
She was on her own. I know it wasn't easy.

177
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:19,418
Do you have any idea who my father is?

178
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:23,722
I could never get her to fess up.

179
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:29,228
Anyway, she finally pulled it together,

180
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,497
Got into college on a scholarship.

181
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:34,867
Where did she go?
Somewhere in north carolina.

182
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:39,071
Duke, I think. Smart girl, smart school.

183
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,708
Let me just grab that.

184
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,189
So it's been a few months. Where you been?

185
00:12:57,257 --> 00:12:58,857
Ah, you know, here and there,

186
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,259
Never one place too long.

187
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:03,495
You know pete. No, actually, I don't,

188
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:06,098
Because you never brought him around.

189
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,002
So blonde's the new flavor of the month, huh?

190
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,271
So sorry I scared her off.

191
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,940
She's not a flavor, mom. I like her.

192
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:19,478
So she's the one? No,
probably not, but maybe.

193
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:23,115
Matt, seriously,
lezzie forbes' daughter? Ucch.

194
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,884
Mom, seriously, Knock it off.

195
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:38,297
Ice, please. So, uh, you heard from vic?

196
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:40,466
No, but don't worry.

197
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:43,202
She'll come home eventually
when she needs something.

198
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,138
I played that game. Are you playing it now?

199
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:48,273
No. Then what are you doin' home?

200
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:51,510
You trying to say I need
a reason to come back?

201
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,315
Sit down. Eat with me.

202
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:01,153
Tell me everything I've missed, hmm.

203
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,794
Thanks for meeting me. Something's come up.

204
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:11,630
Jenna told you. Yeah. So it's true.

205
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:14,132
Your wife isobel was elena's birth mother.

206
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,170
What does elena know? about your wife?

207
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:20,239
About everything. About you, your brother.

208
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:21,607
She knows what I am,

209
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:24,309
And she knows that you
know about the vampires.

210
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:26,678
Does she know about damon and isobel?

211
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:30,516
No. I couldn't tell her,
not until I was sure.

212
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,918
You said you'd help me.

213
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,987
I asked damon without saying too much.

214
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,588
He doesn't remember. Ask him again.

215
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:37,956
Damon is not stable right now.

216
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:39,324
You know, he murdered my wife

217
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:41,627
Or at the very least made a meal out of her.

218
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,862
When has he been stable?
I'm telling you not to push this.

219
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,097
Give me a reason not to.

220
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,698
Your survival. How's that for a reason?

221
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:50,602
I'll handle it, but for now,
I need you to let it go.

222
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,671
Is that what you'll tell elena?

223
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:53,906
Let it go?

224
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:05,183
Leave elena out of this.
I need to know what happened.

225
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:07,486
I think you would, too.

226
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,659
I need something more than
just your wife's name,

227
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,827
A picture, something I could show damon.

228
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:32,244
Is.

229
00:15:32,312 --> 00:15:34,479
Just a few more minutes. Can't you, uh--

230
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:36,748
Can't you finish this in the morning?

231
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,517
But I like working at night.

232
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:40,552
Yeah. See, I like sleeping at night.

233
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,254
With you.

234
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:49,761
Ok, I'll bite. What is it, thesis stuff?

235
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:55,167
Look, baby, I'm in a
3-way here with you and your computer,

236
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:58,904
The least you can do is let
me know what you're up to.

237
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:11,183
I was doing research,
And I dug up all this stuff

238
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,685
About this small town in
virginia near where I grew up.

239
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:17,089
It's isolated, out of the way, and quiet,

240
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:19,825
And every now and then,
people die mysteriously,

241
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:22,227
And they say that it's animal attacks.

242
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,730
Except, these bodies are drained of blood.

243
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:29,534
It's vampires. It has to be.

244
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:34,039
Ok. I'll get my garlic and holy water,

245
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:36,108
And then maybe, just maybe... No.

246
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,745
We can get some sleep. Come here. -No.

247
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:41,446
Look, this is why I love you,

248
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:45,183
Because you believe in all of this stuff,

249
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:48,186
So much so that you're
making a degree out of it.

250
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:53,659
You're like mulder, except hotter and a girl.

251
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:55,927
This is not a joke, rick.

252
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,900
You think that this is cute,
But I'm gonna prove it.

253
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,443
And mulder was right in the end.

254
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:15,714
Ah. They came to the games for us.

255
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:18,316
The football team hadn't won in years.

256
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,686
We were the stars. Well, izzie was.

257
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:23,021
But I was a damn good backup.

258
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,923
Heh. This is great. Thank you.

259
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,025
You're welcome.

260
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:29,361
You haven't touched your tea.

261
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:31,530
Oh. Yeah.

262
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:39,404
What is this?

263
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,306
Oh, it's just some herbal mixture.

264
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:43,308
Vervain?

265
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,047
You know. Know what?

266
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:53,452
You didn't invite me in,
And you're serving vervain tea.

267
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,420
You know.

268
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:58,857
I think that you should probably leave.

269
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:01,493
Wait. What are you not telling me?

270
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:04,930
Please leave. Now!

271
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:46,772
Bourbon. Rocks.

272
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:51,109
Behold the teacher.

273
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:54,613
Don't you have some papers to grade?

274
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,382
It's, uh, more fun with a buzz.

275
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,952
Well, most things in life are.
Sober's depressing.

276
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,455
You don't strike me as
somebody who gets depressed.

277
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:05,791
You say that like you know me.

278
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:10,328
Nope. Just a hunch.

279
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:20,639
You have a good afternoon. Not likely.

280
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,313
Daytime drinking, huh? It's all the rage.

281
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:31,249
Listen, I need a favor.
You ever been in love?

282
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:34,286
Excuse me? Have you ever
been so bent on someone,

283
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:36,822
That you just have your
heart ripped out by them?

284
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:41,760
You forget I was married. Right. Gay husband.

285
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:48,633
She'll have what I'm having. Sit down.

286
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:52,637
There's a fundraiser here tonight

287
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:54,739
That the founder's council is throwing.

288
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:58,109
The town's most eligible bachelors
get raffled off for dates,

289
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:02,047
And, well, we're short a bachelor.

290
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:05,517
Is this what you do when there's no, um...

291
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:09,321
Vampires? Organize bachelor
raffles? Oh, trust me.

292
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,623
At this point, I miss the vampires.

293
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:13,725
Look, you're a hero to this town, damon.

294
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:15,560
I know most people don't know it,

295
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:19,030
But you are, and you're single and a catch.

296
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:20,532
Oh, come on. Help me out.

297
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,035
Carol lockwood won't let me live
it down if I come up empty-handed.

298
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:31,910
You know, a room full of women
clamoring to win a date with me

299
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:36,681
Sounds tasty. Thank you. One thing.

300
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,384
Can you get information on someone for me?

301
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:40,752
Alaric saltzman, the history teacher.

302
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,021
There's just something
a little off about him,

303
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:46,291
And I just-- I just wanna
make sure that the high school

304
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,626
Did their homework on this guy.

305
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:50,528
You got it. Thanks.

306
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:02,140
May I help you? Thank you for the text.

307
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:07,746
You're welcome. I didn't tell her anything.

308
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:11,216
I--I kept my promise. Good.

309
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:13,318
The girl, though, She--she knew something.

310
00:21:13,386 --> 00:21:17,088
That won't be a problem.
She won't get any closer to the truth.

311
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:22,093
Good. So I'm done?

312
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:28,667
Yes. You're done. No! I won't invite you in.

313
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:29,834
You can't come in!

314
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:32,871
I'm not a vampire, so, yes, I can.

315
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,273
I don't understand.

316
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:37,776
I did what you told me. I did my part!

317
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:39,044
And now I have to do mine.

318
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,668
Stefan. Better.

319
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:35,838
Me. You look, um...

320
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:38,707
Dashing? Gorgeous? Irresistible?

321
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,775
Wrecked.

322
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:43,078
- You look wrecked.
- No reason why.

323
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:47,750
Do you know that I am one of mystic
falls' most eligible bachelors?

324
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:49,585
- Huh.
- Yep.

325
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:54,390
- How are you doing?
- Never better.

326
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:58,127
Yep. What can I do for you?

327
00:22:58,194 --> 00:23:00,262
I'm a barrel of favors today.

328
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,198
It's my newfound purpose-
how can I help people?

329
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:06,301
I'm just meeting stefan.
We're going to the fundraiser.

330
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:13,308
Help a guy out, will you? Can't get this.

331
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:25,020
So I found out who my birth mother is.

332
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:26,722
Ecch. Who cares?

333
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,427
She left you. She sucks.

334
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,601
Stefan. There you are.

335
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:47,576
Uhh. I need a bigger jacket. Wow. You know,

336
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:50,012
An occasional sorority girl might, um,

337
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,849
You know, help fill you out a little bit.

338
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,489
He's fine. He's damon.

339
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:02,091
Maybe this heartache will be good for him.

340
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:05,194
It'll remind him that he has one,
even if it doesn't beat.

341
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:07,796
Won't hold my breath.

342
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,634
So I went to see trudie peterson.

343
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:16,839
I know. I'm sorry. I didn't plan it.

344
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,110
How was it? She has vervain.

345
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:22,611
She knows about vampire stuff,

346
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,346
And it can't be a coincidence.

347
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:30,919
It isn't. This is alaric's wife.

348
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:35,357
This is her. This is isobel.
He gave this to you?

349
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:38,093
Everything he knows about vampires,
he learned from her.

350
00:24:38,161 --> 00:24:42,231
He believes that she was killed by one.

351
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,201
Oh, my god. Listen, elena, there's a lot

352
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,537
About isobel that alaric can tell you,

353
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:51,306
But I need you to hold off a little while

354
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:52,608
Before you talk to him.

355
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:54,843
Why? I know that it's a lot to ask of you,

356
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,880
But will you do that for me?

357
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,152
Tickets for the raffle are now on sale.

358
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:07,055
All proceeds benefit the annual
founder's day celebration.

359
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:08,690
That's a good look for you.

360
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,126
What? Embarrassing and uncomfortable?

361
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:13,896
Yep. That's-- that's the one.

362
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:17,666
Hey, look. I'm, uh, sorry about earlier.

363
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,935
It was just kind of a--a shock.

364
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:23,572
Well, I'm sorry for dropping it on you,

365
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,040
But I felt like you should know.

366
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,742
No, I get it.

367
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:29,077
At some point, maybe you
and elena could talk.

368
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:32,181
I'm sure she'd like to hear
about isobel, what she was like.

369
00:25:32,248 --> 00:25:36,251
Yeah. Uh... Or not. No pressure.

370
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:40,022
I don't know if that's a--a great idea.

371
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:43,559
at least not--not for a while.

372
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:48,463
Where'd our girlfriend go?
She's on her way to the grill.

373
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,035
I, uh, wanted to talk to you.

374
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,505
This is the woman, isobel,

375
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:58,340
From north carolina. Remember her now?

376
00:25:58,408 --> 00:26:01,743
Who wants to know? -I do.
Who else wants to know?

377
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:06,582
Did you kill her? Sorry. Don't know her.

378
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,317
Hey, are you comin'?

379
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:11,887
The real housewives of mystic falls await.

380
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:14,356
He's already been hit on, like, 35 times.

381
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:15,791
He's total cougar bait.

382
00:26:15,858 --> 00:26:16,792
Impressive.

383
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:18,227
More like embarrassing.

384
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:19,895
Heh heh. Hi, mrs. Donovan.

385
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:24,066
Elena, honey. Hi, kelly.

386
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:26,368
Long time, no see.
How are you doing? Oh, same old.

387
00:26:26,436 --> 00:26:28,570
Oh. Matty tells me you broke his heart.

388
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:31,273
Mom. Just kidding. Calm down.

389
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:35,844
He found his rebound girl. Oh.
Here you go, sweetheart.

390
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:37,012
However many that'll buy.

391
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,549
I just hope I don't get bachelor 3.
I dated him in high school.

392
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:41,550
Not impressive.

393
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:43,118
in any way.

394
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:47,589
Very exciting.

395
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:58,367
I've got the big date planned.

396
00:26:58,434 --> 00:27:01,770
It's a romantic dinner,
Secluded spot somewhere woodsy.

397
00:27:01,838 --> 00:27:04,006
You're making me think I should buy a ticket.

398
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:07,876
Well, you are in charge.
You could always rig it.

399
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,414
Pardon me.

400
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,119
I ran the check on the history teacher.

401
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:19,221
You want this before or after your big debut?

402
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,290
How's it look? He checks out.

403
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:22,324
Couple of speeding tickets.

404
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,759
It's a rough story, though.

405
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,060
Turns out his wife went missing

406
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:26,495
A few years back in north carolina.

407
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:31,033
North carolina? She have a name?

408
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:37,072
Yeah. Isobel. Isobel.

409
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:54,775
And what do you do, bachelor number 3?

410
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:58,345
Yeah, I'm a plumber.
Well, isn't that wonderful?

411
00:27:58,413 --> 00:27:59,913
We could always use more plumbers.

412
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:01,915
Moving on.

413
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:05,519
Number 4, "alaric saltzman."

414
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:07,121
Wow. That's quite a mouthful.

415
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:08,288
What do you do, alaric?

416
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:10,124
I'm a teacher at mystic falls high.

417
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:13,026
Oh, beauty and brains, ladies.

418
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:15,763
This one's a keeper. What do you teach?

419
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,433
- History.
- History. Oh, well, give us a fun fact

420
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:21,969
About mystic falls, something crazy.

421
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:27,641
Uh, well...

422
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,879
He probably saving the
best stories for his date.

423
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:37,050
And last, but not least, Damon salvatore.

424
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:41,455
We don't have much on you.
Well, I'm tough to fit on a card.

425
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:43,590
Do you have any hobbies, like to travel?

426
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:46,393
Oh, yeah. L.A., new york.

427
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:49,163
Couple of years ago, I was in north carolina,

428
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,831
Near the duke campus, actually.

429
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:53,500
I think--I think alaric when to school there.

430
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:54,535
Didn't you, rick?

431
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:57,871
Yeah, 'cause I-- I know your wife did.

432
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:00,841
I had a drink with her once.

433
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:03,510
She was--she was a great girl.

434
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:06,980
I ever tell you that? 'cause she was--

435
00:29:07,048 --> 00:29:10,417
She-- Delicious.

436
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:22,362
Are you ok? I just need some air.

437
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:29,770
Elena. He killed her?

438
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:31,605
Damon was the vampire that killed her?

439
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:33,974
I don't know what happened.
Alaric said that they never found the body.

440
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:34,975
Oh, my god. Stefan.

441
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:37,945
I know. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you,

442
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:40,314
But I just-- I wanted to know more.

443
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,549
I was feeling sorry for him,

444
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:45,486
Hoping that this whole katherine
thing would change him.

445
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:46,620
I'm so stupid.

446
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:48,555
He doesn't know about the connection to you.

447
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:50,691
I thought about confronting him,
but he's already so on edge.

448
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:52,626
Why are you protecting him?

449
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:57,664
Because you're not the only one
hoping that he might actually change.

450
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:05,606
That man.

451
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:09,543
I saw that man outside of trudie's.

452
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:12,312
Get back inside. Come on.

453
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:22,422
And bachelor number 3 goes to 37458.

454
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,229
Ah. Kelly donovan. Lovely.

455
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:33,166
You and the plumber should have so much fun.

456
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:34,835
Congratulations, mrs. Donovan.

457
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:39,606
Ok, just stop. Stop trying so hard.

458
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:43,043
This thing you're doing,
this nice thing, it's fake,

459
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:44,244
Like you, like your mom,

460
00:30:44,312 --> 00:30:46,113
And for some reason, matt fell for it,

461
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,282
But that doesn't mean that I will.

462
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:49,850
I don't like you, ok?

463
00:30:49,918 --> 00:30:53,086
So tell plumber boy I'll be at the bar.

464
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:58,425
Ok. Whoa. Easy there.

465
00:30:58,493 --> 00:30:59,626
Buy a ticket like everyone else.

466
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:02,262
Did you enjoy that,
Rubbing it in to alaric saltzman?

467
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,297
What?

468
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:05,265
Just as I was starting to think that there

469
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,934
Was something redeemable about you.

470
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:10,037
Elena. Am I missing something here?

471
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:12,472
Did I forget to mention
earlier when we were talking

472
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,576
About my birth mother,
The one that gave me up?

473
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:17,978
Her name was isobel.

474
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:25,385
Go ahead. Reminisce about how you killed her.

475
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:41,101
Come on. Let's get you home.
I have a message for you.

476
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:44,004
What? Who are you? Stop looking.

477
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:45,405
Stop looking for what?

478
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:49,676
She doesn't want to know you.
She doesn't want to talk to you.

479
00:31:49,744 --> 00:31:51,144
Isobel?

480
00:31:51,212 --> 00:31:53,180
You need to stop looking. Do you understand?

481
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,516
She's alive? Does that mean she's a--

482
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:58,185
Elena, he's under a compulsion.

483
00:31:58,252 --> 00:31:59,920
Do you understand? Yes. I do.

484
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:01,321
Good.

485
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,293
I'm done now.

486
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,953
Come on. Let's get out of here.

487
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:30,459
37649. That's me.

488
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:31,693
Congratulations.

489
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:38,600
And bachelor number 5, damon salvatore.

490
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:46,374
37552. Would you look at that. 37552.

491
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:48,376
What are the chances? Me.

492
00:32:49,712 --> 00:32:53,482
- Where'd he go?
- I'm gonna call you later.

493
00:32:58,121 --> 00:33:00,322
I think it's time to let
this vampire crap go.

494
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:03,825
I mean, the research, the trips,
it's become an obsession.

495
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:05,293
Well, this is important to me, rick.

496
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:06,628
Why? Why is it so important?

497
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:10,031
Explain it to me. I mean, make me understand.

498
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:16,104
I mean, what's the point of this?

499
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:19,174
You don't want kids. You're barely ever home.

500
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:20,275
I just want us to be normal people.

501
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:21,843
Maybe I don't want to.

502
00:33:21,911 --> 00:33:26,982
Maybe I want more.

503
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:34,456
Here we go. Home, sweet home.

504
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:36,191
Wait. Why--why are we back here?

505
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:39,194
I wasn't ready to leave. Yeah, you were, mom.

506
00:33:42,465 --> 00:33:45,801
You're the best, matty. I know.

507
00:33:45,868 --> 00:33:52,274
I'm--I'm sorry... I was gone so long.

508
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:57,078
Why are you really home, mom?

509
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,652
It's pete. He's gone,

510
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:07,022
And it's all my fault.
I did it. I always do it.

511
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:10,192
No, you didn't, mom. It's not your fault.

512
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:18,300
You're all I have left.

513
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:25,841
Please don't leave me.
I'm not goin' anywhere.

514
00:34:48,397 --> 00:34:50,866
Are you really this stupid?

515
00:34:56,372 --> 00:34:57,973
Guess so.

516
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,683
You gonna put down the stake?

517
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:13,288
Wow. That's courage. Where's isobel?

518
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:15,690
What have you done to my wife?

519
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:18,526
You want me to tell you I killed her?
Would that make you happy?

520
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:19,861
Because I think you know what happened.

521
00:35:19,929 --> 00:35:23,632
I saw you feeding on her. Yeah.
I did, and I wasn't lying.

522
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:26,801
She was delicious.

523
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:32,707
Oh, come on. What do you think happened?

524
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:33,808
Not an inkling?

525
00:35:33,876 --> 00:35:36,578
Never considered the possibility?

526
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:42,317
I turned her. Why?

527
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:45,854
She came to me, all pathetic,
Looking for vampires.

528
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:49,024
There was something about her,
Something I liked.

529
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:52,160
There was something special.
You turned her because you liked her?

530
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:54,129
No, I slept with her because I liked her.

531
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,665
I turned her because she begged me to.

532
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:01,603
Yeah. But you knew that, too, didn't you?

533
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:04,239
Hmm. I guess she wasn't happy at home,

534
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:06,908
Wasn't happy with life in general,

535
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:11,913
Wasn't happy with you. Gaah!

536
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:15,417
Ah, this is a shame.

537
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:18,586
We're kindred spirits,
abandoned by the women we love.

538
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:23,458
Unrequited love sucks.

539
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:25,627
Sounds like I got a lung.

540
00:36:25,695 --> 00:36:27,862
Which means I get to sit
here and watch you die.

541
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:18,551
What happened? What did you do?

542
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:23,289
- Dude, what? He attacked me.
- Damon.

543
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:26,826
All I did was tell him the truth.
His wife didn't want him anymore.

544
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:29,329
It's not my fault he couldn't handle it.

545
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:30,497
Like you've been handling katherine?

546
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:36,169
I'm handling it fine. You know what?

547
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:38,972
Isobel came to me. She found me.

548
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,540
And if she's related to elena,

549
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:42,242
That means she's related to katherine.

550
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:45,512
Maybe katherine sent her to me.

551
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:48,548
Stop it. You don't have to keep looking.

552
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:51,150
Can't be a coincidence isobel sought me out.

553
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:56,789
Can't. I'm assuming you'll take care of this.

554
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:30,823
What happened? What's going on?

555
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:36,062
You were just... Did damon turn you?

556
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:42,168
No. I went for him, And then he stabbed me.

557
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,671
No, no, no. You must have
vampire blood in your system.

558
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:45,772
Somebody slipped it to you.

559
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,076
No. It's... it's something else.

560
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:55,081
Then how? I...

561
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,521
Isobel. Surprise gifts aren't fair.

562
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,557
I always feel bad for not
getting you something.

563
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:10,563
Just open it. Oh,
that's a giant piece of jewelry.

564
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:14,300
I know. It's ridiculous.
Just tell people it's a family heirloom.

565
00:39:14,368 --> 00:39:17,337
Nobody questions that. Where'd you get this?

566
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:19,472
If I told you, you'd laugh at me.

567
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,575
But promise me that you'll always wear it.

568
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:25,878
It'll protect you from all the
things that go bump in the night.

569
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,982
A ring to ward off the demons, eh?

570
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:32,719
Consider it a-- a token of my love,

571
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:35,221
My affection, and if nothing else,

572
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,757
An apology for being so crazy.

573
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:40,593
Well, you were definitely crazy.

574
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,762
I'm selfish, and I'm obsessed,

575
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,731
And I'm a horrible wife.

576
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,700
But you love me anyway.

577
00:39:48,936 --> 00:39:51,137
Yes, I do.

578
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:55,608
This ring protected me.

579
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:04,984
That's impossible. I know.

580
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,024
Was there a problem?

581
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:50,630
Did you find her? What's going on?

582
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,967
Isobel?

583
00:41:21,628 --> 00:41:28,334
It's harper. I'm glad you found us.

584
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:32,872
Ms. Gibbons, This gentleman
is a friend of mine.

585
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,307
May he come in?

586
00:41:34,374 --> 00:41:36,275
Any friend of pearl's is a friend of mine.

587
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:39,011
Please do. Come in.

588
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:42,281
Annabelle, close the door, please.
