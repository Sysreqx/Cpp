For over a century,
I have lived in secret untinow.

00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:06,545
I know the risk. But I have to know her.

00:00:06,612 --> 00:00:08,246
Elena--she's a deadringer for katherine.

5
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:10,615
That neckless contains
an herb calledervain.

6
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:12,684
It protects u from being compelled.

7
00:00:12,752 --> 00:00:14,786
My love for therine wasn't real, damon.

8
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:16,054
I'm gonna bring her back.

00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:17,656
There's a tomb underneath the church.

10
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:20,358
A spell sealed katherine in
that tomb, protecting her.

Hello, jenna. Logan.

26
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,952
I've never been in your room before.

27
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:51,056
This room holds every memory that I
ever that I thought was important
enough to hold onto.

28
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:52,657
Elena?

29
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:58,230
Elena. It's stefan.

I know that picture must have
confused you. But I can explain.

31
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:05,070

I want you to put your hands
on the roof. Just like that.

Are you ok?

49
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:33,057
Can you stand? Anything broken?

50
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:34,325
Uh-uh.

51
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,401
Whoa, you're fading fast, elena.
Elena, look at me.

52
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:48,205
Focus. Look at me.

53
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:49,973
Ok.

54
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,543
I look like her.

55
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,811
What?

56
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:06,623

59
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,944
After years of reseah and study,
there it was right in front of me.

60
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,079
I was terrified.

61
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:33,384
As I stared it in the eyes,
I drove a stake through its heart.

62
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,121
I was right about mystic falls.

63
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:38,355
There is evil here.

64
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:41,625

Mmm. It's not even 7:00 yet.

68
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:03,046
Which means you shouldn't be
awake for at least 6 hours.

69
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:04,681
I hate morning people.

70
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,918

75
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,596
Georgia.

00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:56,333
No, no. No, we're not.

00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:12,115
I hit a man.

85
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:14,351
But then he got up and--who was that?

86
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:16,920
That's what I would like to know.

Why are you doing this?

98
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:54,424
I can't be in georgia. I wrecked my car.

I have to go home.

100
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:57,727
This is kidnapping.

101
00:05:57,795 --> 00:06:00,463
That's a little melodramatic,
don'you think?

102
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:01,698
You're not funny.

103
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,466
You can't do this.

Yeah. I don't--

121
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:48,979
I don't think she wants
to talk to you right now.

if you touch her--

Where is there?!

128
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:16,006
A little place right outside of atlanta.

129
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:17,474
Oh, come on, elena.

130
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,676
You don't wanna go
back right now. Do you?

131
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:23,413
What's the rush? Time-out.

132
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:27,784
Trust me. Your problems are still
going to be there when you get home.

133
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:30,653
Look. Step away from
your life for 5 minutes.

Will you promise not to do

138
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,101

139
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,503
Yes.

140
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,638
Can I trust you?

141
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:51,941
Get in the car. Come on.

00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:01,685
Hey, jeremy.

144
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:04,621
I, uh--can't find my ring.
I took it off for the gym

145
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,592
And thought I put it-- there it is.

146
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:14,565
Losing family heirlooms-- bad.

147
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:17,468
How's your extra credit coming?
You pick a topic yet?

148

149
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:20,571
What's the angle?

150
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:21,905
My family-- I found a journal

151
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,308
Of an anstor who lived in the 1800s.

152
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:28,645
And the gilberts were one of t original
founding families of mystic falls. So...

153
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:31,548
That sounds good.

154
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:32,783

00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:34,351

156
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,520
I haven't seen you lately.

157
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:39,423
How are you doing with everything?

158
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:41,725
I'm fine. It's all fine.

159
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:43,227
Good. Yeah

160
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:45,696
Are you back in school?

161
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:48,766
No. Actually I came here to find you.

162
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,436
I s hoping you could help
me with something. A spell.

163
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:57,708
Stefan, look, I know elena's
ok with all of this,

164
00:08:57,776 --> 00:08:59,410
And I appreciate what
you did to help me.

165
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:02,112
But I'm not really ready to
dive into it with you just yet.

166
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,248
I understand. But I need your he.

167
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:08,585
It's elena. She's with damon.

168
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,190
I have elena's necklace.
I was just hoping you could e this

169
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:14,725
To make some sort of a connection.

170
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:16,460
I just neeto know that she's ok.

171
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:17,661
How do you know I can do this?

172
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,630
Because I've known a few
witches over the years.

173
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:20,831
I've seen what they can do.

174
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,166
I'm still new at it.

175
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,234
It's ok.

176
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,869
Give it a shot.

177
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:28,138
Ok.

178
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:29,606
All right.

179
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:42,386
There's nothing.

180
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:46,990
Nothing's happening.
Usually there's an image or...

181
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:48,325
Tell me if anyone's looking.

182
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:49,760
Ok.

183
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:51,562
All right.

184
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:12,549
What is it?

185
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:14,351
Something's wrong. With elena?

186
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,920
With me. There's
something wrong with me.

187
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:19,523
I have to go. I'm sorry, stefan.

188
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,592
I can't hp you.

189
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:28,966
So, where's my car?

190
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:30,167
I pulled it off on the side of the road.

191
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,135
I don't think anyone will bother it.

192
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:34,738
At about that man in the road?

193
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,274
Was he a...?

194
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:39,877
From what I could tell. Yeah.

195
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:41,645
You don't kn him?

196
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:43,714
If I've never met him,
I wouldn't know him.

197
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:48,852
I mean, it's not like we all hang out
together at the vamp bar and grill.

198
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,494
You brought me to a bar?

199
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:59,863
Damon, I'm not old enough.
They're not going to let me in.

200
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,598
Sure they will.

201
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,534
[hands clap]

202
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:08,171
[music playing]

203
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,710
No. No, it can't be.

204
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:15,445
Damon.

205
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:23,186
My honey pie.

206
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:32,936
Listen up everybody!

207
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:36,372
Here's to the man that broke my heart,

208
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,107
Crushed my soul,

209
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:39,676
Destroyed my life,

210
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:42,578
And ruined any and all
chances of happiness!

211
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:45,515
Drink up!

212
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:50,853
Ahh. Whoo!

213
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:55,058
So, how'd he rope you in?

214
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,193
I'm not roped in.
Actually, I'm dating his--

215
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:59,562
Honey, if you're not roped,
you're whipped.

216
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,698
Either way, just eoy the ride.

217
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:03,032
Ok.

218
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,068
So, how did you two meet?

219
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:06,669
College.

220
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:08,571
You went to college?

221
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,040
I've been on a college campus, yes.

222
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:14,177
About 20 years ago, when I was
just a sweet, young freshman.

223
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:17,780
I met this butiful man,
and fell in love.

224
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:19,782
And then he told me
about his littleecret,

225
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,551
Made me love himore.

226
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,386
Because, you see,
I had a little secret of my own

227
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:25,855
That I was dying to share with somebody.

228
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:27,890
She's a witch.

229
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,792
Changed my world.

230
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,828
I rocked your world.

231
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:34,030
He is good in the sack, isn't he?

232
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:38,568
But mostly he's just a walkawayoe.

233
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:46,743
So, what is it that you want?

234
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,710
Oh my god. I am so sorry.

235
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:23,079
There was this one book
wedged between the other.

236
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:26,249
And I pulled and then kaplunk, kaboom.

237
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:27,350
Are you ok?

238
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:30,053
Yeah, I'm fine.

239
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:35,792
Ohh!

240
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:40,096
I'm anna.

241
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:41,531
I'm jeremy.

242
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,381
Thank god you're back.

243
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:02,285
And hello to you, too.
What's the matter?

244
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:06,189
Powers are gone, grams.
I can't do anything,

245
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:07,490
Even when I concentrate.

246
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:09,525
And there's nothing in
in any of these books

247
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:11,027
That can tell me how to get them back.

248
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:13,896
Hang on, now. Just calm down.

249
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:15,364
Tell me what happened.

250
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:17,633
I can't.

251
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:19,869
We keeping secrets now?

252
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:24,207
I have to. I'm sorry. I promised.

253
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:27,043
Please help me.

254
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,015
Well, first of all, there's nothing
in any of these that's gonna help you.

255
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,351
If you're blocked, it's in here.

256
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:38,988
You gotta clear it out,
then you're back in business.

257
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:40,790
Clear what out?

258
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:43,826
Whatever's got you so scared.

259
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:49,298
Hi, jenna. I'm so sorry.

260
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:52,235
Where are you? Why didn't you call?

261
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:54,704
I was so tired last night.
I fell asleep at bonnie's.

262
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,974
And then this morning,
I just wanted to get to school.

263
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,476
Are you ok?

264
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:03,980
You know, stefan and stuff.

265
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,619
Come on, there's gotta b another way.

266
00:15:09,686 --> 00:15:12,221
After all these years,
it's still only katherine.

267
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:13,923
How do you even know she's still alive?

268
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:17,827
Well, you help me get into
that tomb and we'll find out.

269
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:22,565
I already did. 20 years ago. Remember?

270
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,866
3 easy steps--

271
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:25,935
Comet. Crystal. Spell.

272
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:27,370
There's a little problem with number 2.

273
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:29,372
I don't have the crystal.

274
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:33,676
That's it, damon. There is no other way.
It's emily's spell.

275
00:15:33,744 --> 00:15:36,245
What about a new spell

276
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:39,448
With a new crystal that
overrides emily's spell?

277
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:41,551
It doesn't work that way, baby.

278
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:45,988
Emily's spell is absolute.
You can't get into that tomb.

279
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:49,585

287
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:15,478
You lied.

288
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:17,246
Not until I explain, please.

289
00:17:17,314 --> 00:17:19,048
So, you didn't lie?

290
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:21,384
Just tell me where you are.
So that I can comeet you.

291
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:24,387
How am I connected to katherine, stefan?

292
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:26,489
I honestly don't know.

293
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,257
And I'm supposed to believe that?

294
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:30,393
It's the truth. I--

295
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,728

Hi.

310
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,132
Can I help you?

311
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,702
I'm stefan. I'm a friend of bonnie's.

312
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,140
Her dad told me that she might be here.

313
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,077
She was. Not anymore.

314
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,211
Do you know where she went?

315
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,712
No. But you do.

316
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,181
I'm sorry?

317
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,950
I told her to face down her fear.

318
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:16,822
And I'm sensing now that you
know exactly why she was scared.

319
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,523
You know what I am.

320
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,059
And yet you offered me your hand,

321
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,663
Which means you wanted me
to see that I can trust you.

322
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,998
Can you?

323
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,268
I ust you'll keep her safe.

324
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,571
You'd better be on your way, then.

325
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,172
I'm not going to invite you in.

326
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,008
I'm sure you understand why.

327
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,782
This aisle is local and state history.

328
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,651
And civil war is one over.

329
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,752
What do you need?

330
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,754
Local. 1860s. Do you work here?

331
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,425
Nope. You want reference. This way.

332
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:57,462
Uh, home-schooled. I study here
for a moc school environment.

333
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,030
Ah, here we go.

334
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:03,201
Original settlers, town archives,
founders stuff. It's all here.

335
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,936
So, what's your topi

336
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:08,607
The town's fear and
hysteria surrounding the war

337
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,976
And how it influenced
certain writers of the time.

338
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,644
You might want to focus that.

339
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,447
The origin of local folklore and myths.

340
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:18,383
You mean the vampires?

341
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,188
Let's just say that I'm
descended from katherine--

342
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,557
Does that make me part vampire?

343
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,293
Vampires can't procreate.

344
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,428
But we love to try.

345
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,230
No.

346
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,700
If you are related,
it would mean katherine had a child

347
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:36,935
Before she was turned.

348
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,772
Did stefan think that he
could use me to replace her?

349
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,741
Kinda creepy if you ask me.

350
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,043
Come on, what? You don't like pickl?

351
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,511
What's wrong with you?

352
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,646
How can you even eat?

353
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,315
If technically you're supposed to be--

354
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,617
Dead.

355
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,586
It's not such a bad word.

356
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:58,690
As long as I keep a healthy
diet of blood in my system,

357
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:03,728
Our dy functions pretty normally.

358
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,933
This nice act. Is any of it real?

359
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,937
Bree: Here you go, honey.

360
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,705
Thank you.

361
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,941
I'll have one too.

362
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,409
Hmm?

363
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,679
Time out, remember? For 5 minutes?

364
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,981
Yeah, well that 5 minutes
is going to need a beer.

365
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,151
There you go.

366
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,227
You're kidding me, right?
There's no such thing as vampires.

367
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:38,363
Well, there's not a lot of documentation

368
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,532
But the stories have been
told since the civil war.

369
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,835
My granddad used to tell me all these
creepy stories when I was little.

370
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,838
And he said that his
granddad told them to him.

371
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,139
Yeah. That would be folklore.

372
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,609
Vampires are a metaphor
for the demons of the day.

373
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,110
Which are?

374
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,646
The union soldiers.
I've read the stories myself.

375
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:57,916
They talk about the enemy,
the demons that attack night.

376
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,252
That sounds like vampires to me.

377
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,188
Allegorical vampires.
Which is what it is.

378
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,890
Creative expression during
a very volatile time.

379
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,426
I mean, a couny at war
doesn't want realism.

380
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,529
They want fantasy.
Thus, vampire fiction.

381
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,166
Man, you're smart.

382
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:18,937
I gotta give it to you.
When I first saw you, I missed it.

383
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,407
Yeah. I've had a rough go of it lately.

384
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,710
But I'm just now getting
back to my old self.

385
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,117
Well, good luck on the paper.
I gotta get home.

386
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,953
You know, my great grandfather
actually showed me a journal once

387
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:38,957
Of an ancestor and he had written all
of this creepy stuff about vampires.

388
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,026
It was actually really believable.

389
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,127
Wait. A journal?

390
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,562
Yeah? Why?

391
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,033
Are you sure you have to go?

392
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,235
[cell phone beeps]

393
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,573
Come on, phone!

394
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,776
[cell phone beeping]

395
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,079
Great! Great.

396
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,370
[rumbling]

397
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,241
[screaming]

398
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:34,719
Bonnie! Get away from me!

399
00:23:34,787 --> 00:23:35,987
It's me. It's stefan.

400
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:37,422
Stefan.

401
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,224
The ground gave way and I fell.

402
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:42,760
It's ok. It's ok. Calm down.

403
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:44,328
Come on, let's get you out of here.

404
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:45,863
How?

405
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,566
Just close your eyes.

406
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:51,335
Trust .

407
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:07,285
You can open your eyes now.

408
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:10,021
Whoa.

409
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,255
I didn't want to scare you.

410
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:12,490
How did you know where I was?

411
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:14,459
Well, your grandmother told
me what you were doing.

412
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:16,461
I guessed the where.

413
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,465
I heard them.

414
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:24,936
Down there. Behind the door.

415
00:24:25,003 --> 00:24:26,871
Are they in pain?

416
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:29,040
In the beginning--yes. But not anymore.

417
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:31,209
They've been starved to
the point of dessication.

418
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:33,711
But if they have blood--

419
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,213
That's not going to happen, bonnie.

420
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,614
They can't get out.

421
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:40,051
Emily saw to that when she
had you destroy the crystal.

422
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,720
You're safe.

423
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:46,491
Ready...Go!

424
00:24:49,228 --> 00:24:52,463
That's 3.

425
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:53,898
Do you need a bib?

426
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:57,635
Sorry I can't unhinge my jaw
like a snake to consume alcohol.

427
00:24:57,703 --> 00:25:00,671
Whatever. All right. Who's next?

428
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:02,206
Another round, bree.

429
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:05,276
Honey, you should be on the floor.

430
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:10,381
I am not even drunk.
My tolerance is, like, way up here.

431
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,619
Bree: All right. Here you go.

432
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:26,130
Jeremy: So, you have no
idea where the journal is?

433
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:27,865
Nope. Gramps died.

434
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:30,401
And all the kids split
his stuff. I can ask.

435
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:33,471
I just find it weird that our ancestors
kept the same kind of journal.

436
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,972
It's crazy.

437
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,009
Maybe it's based in
some partial reality.

438
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:39,110
No. It's gotta be a metaphorical.

439
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:41,279
My ancestor wrote short stories.

440
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:43,981
So, that's why you're hung
up on the fiction of it all.

441
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,983
No, I'm hung up on fiction of it all

442
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:47,985
Because I've seen "the lost boys"

443
00:25:48,053 --> 00:25:49,720
And "near dark," like, 50 times.

444
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:51,989
Are those movies?

445
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:54,759
Hey. I've never seen them.

446
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:56,828
Maybe we can have a fright night

447
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:59,897
And rent a whole bunch
of vampire movies.

448
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:03,835
Uh, yeah, sure.

449
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:08,272
Why does tt sound like a no way in hell?

450
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,008
Sorry, I'm blunt.

451
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:14,745
No, it's--I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

452
00:26:14,813 --> 00:26:17,014
I just recently got out of something,

453
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:19,417
It's a little too soon, you know?

454
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:22,253
Oh please, sure. No worries.

455
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:25,823
I meant as friends. Yeah.

456
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:28,626
Look, I really gotta go.

457
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:33,231
Nice meeting you, jeremy.

458
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:44,075
[cell phone ringing] yeah!

459
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:51,782
Hello? Jenna?

460
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,452
Hold on, it's loud in here.

461
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:58,656
Huh? Yeah. No, I'm good.

462
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:01,692
Eveything's fine. Hold on.
I can't hear you.

463
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Hello?

464
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:10,434
[mumbling]

465
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,330
Hey, where's your girl?

466
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:21,465
Hmm.

467
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,868
She was right back there.

468
00:27:54,032 --> 00:27:55,466
Damon, no.

469
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,775
What t hell?!

470
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,213
No!

471
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:18,055
Who are you?

472
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:22,059
That's pfect. You have no idea.

473
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:23,794
What are you talking aut?
What did he do?

474
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:26,264
He killed my girlfriend.

475
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:33,671
What did she do to you,
huh? What did she do to you?!

476
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:35,606
Nothing.

477
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,009
Elena: I don't understand.

478
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:40,311
My girlfriend went to visit sfan,

479
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:43,047
And damokilled her. Got it?

480
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:47,251
Ugh!

481
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,353
Lexi?

482
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:51,389
Lexi was your girlfriend?

483
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:52,490
She told me about you.

484
00:28:52,557 --> 00:28:54,926
She said you were human.

485
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:57,895
I was.

486
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:07,438
Lexi turned you?

487
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,307
If you want to be with someone forever,

488
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:11,909
You have to live forever.

489
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,551
She loved u.

490
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:24,221
She said, "when it's real,
you can't walk away."

491
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:27,591
Well, that's a choice you're
not going to have to make.

492
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:31,495
Don't. Don't, please, don't hurt him--

493
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:37,368
I'm doing you a favor.

494
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:40,338
Lexi loved y. And she was good.

495
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,606
That means you're good too.

496
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:45,476
Be better than him.

497
00:29:45,544 --> 00:29:48,646
Don't do this. I'm begging you!

498
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:50,848
Please.

499
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:13,838
Thank you.

500
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:18,943
It wasn't for you.

501
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,359
Well, now, look who's
returned from battle

502
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,999
Can I talk to your friend for minute?

503
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:48,905
Thank you.

504
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:54,210
I appreciate your help, stefan.

505
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:57,680
You're welcome, sheila.

506
00:30:58,783 --> 00:31:01,051
I wasn't sure you remembered.

507
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:03,319
October 1969.

508
00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:05,455
I was barely a teenager.

509
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:06,723
And you were leading what was probably

510
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:11,027
The only anti-war si
t-in within miles of mystic falls.

511
00:31:11,095 --> 00:31:12,328
Hmm.

512
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:15,932
You knowwhen you spoke,
people were mesmerized.

513
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:17,967
I know I was.

514
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:21,004
Until the cops showed up.

515
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,741
You took a big risk
coming to see me earlier.

516
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:27,677
Letting me read you,
realize who you were.

517
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:30,780
It could have gone a
completely different way.

518
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:36,386
Your familhas a very long
history of keeping my secret.

519
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:40,957
I knew that I could trust you if you
believed I waworthy of your trust.

520
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,860
Bonnie knows, doesn't she?

521
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:46,729
Yes.

522
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:50,967
Please understand,
our loyalty can only extend so far.

523
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:55,171
This town won't be easy on any
of us if they figure it out.

524
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:58,174
And I'll protect my own
before anybody else.

525
00:31:58,242 --> 00:32:00,443
I know that.

526
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:03,546
As long as we're clear

527
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:07,383
Goodnight, then.

528
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:09,419
Goodnight, sheila.

529
00:32:21,031 --> 00:32:24,534
We were just leaving,
and I wanted to sagood bye.

530
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:28,972
Good to see you again, damon.

531
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,141
No ks?

532
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,276
I'm full of vervain.

533
00:32:33,344 --> 00:32:35,712
I put it in everything I drink.

534
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,714
And you're telling me this why?

535
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:40,583
Lexi was my friend.

536
00:32:40,651 --> 00:32:43,453
How could you?

537
00:32:46,023 --> 00:32:49,159
The tomb can be opened.

538
00:32:49,226 --> 00:32:50,426
You're lying!

539
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:52,195
Emily's grimoire, her spellbook.

540
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:54,664
If you know how she closed the tomb

541
00:32:54,732 --> 00:32:57,800
The reversal process will be in
her book. You can open that tomb.

542
00:32:57,868 --> 00:32:58,801
D where is this book?

543
00:32:58,869 --> 00:32:59,836
I--I--

544
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,271
You have no idea.

545
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:03,907
No. I'm telling you the truth.

546
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:06,409
And I believe you.

547
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:09,145
My dear, sweet bree.

548
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:11,281
That's why I'm almost sorry.

549
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:13,550
Ugh!

550
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:40,519
So, why did you bring me with you?

551
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:44,323
Wellyou're not the worst
company in the world, elena.

552
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,225
You ould give yourself more credit.

553
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:47,560
Seriously?

554
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:52,865
You were there in the road.
All damsel in distress-like.

555
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:54,767
And I knew it would piss off stefan.

556
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:56,769
And...

557
00:33:56,837 --> 00:34:01,107
U're not the worst company
in the world, elena.

558
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:04,643
I used to be more fun.

559
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,345
You did ok.

560
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:09,615
I saved your life.

561
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:12,017
I know.

562
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:14,253
And don't you forget it.

563
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:30,102
[footsteps approaching]

564
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:32,538
Hi.

565
00:34:32,606 --> 00:34:33,906
Hi.

566
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:38,310
You coulhave told me.

567
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,079
I wanted to tell you.

568
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:43,616
You said no more lies. Only the truth.

569
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:46,018
I can handle the truth, stefan.

570
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:47,686
As crazy as it is,

571
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:51,424
I can handle the fact
that you are a vampire.

572
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:54,560
D you have a vampire brother.

573
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:57,696
And that my best friend is a witch.

574
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:02,201
I can accept the fact that the
world is much more mysterious place

575
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,502
Than I ever thought possible.

576
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:09,508
But this--this lie, I can't take.

577
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:11,577
What am I to you?

578
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:13,612
Who am I to you?

579
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,748
You are not katherine.

580
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:18,617
You are the opposite
everything that she was.

581
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:20,119
And when did you figure that out?

582
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,787
Before you kissed me?

583
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:24,623
Before we slept together?

584
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:28,727
Before I met you.

585
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,063
What?

586
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:37,503
The first day of school. We when met.

587
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:39,805
It wasn't for the first time, elena.

588
00:35:41,107 --> 00:35:43,008
Then when was it?

589
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:45,744
May 23, 2009.

590
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,413
But that was--

591
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:52,518
That was the day your parents'
car went off the bridge.

592
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,988
You were the?

593
00:35:56,056 --> 00:35:58,557
Every couple of years
that I come back here

594
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:02,428
To see zach and see my home.

595
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:08,667
Last spring, I was out in the woods,
by old wickery bridge.

596
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:13,339
And I heard the accident. All of it.

597
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:17,142
I was fast getting there,
but not fast enough.

598
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,813
The car was already submerged.

599
00:36:22,048 --> 00:36:25,818
Your dad was still-
he was still conscious.

600
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:27,253
I was able to get to him,

601
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,825
But he wouldn't let me help
him until I helped you.

602
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:35,094
Oh my god.

603
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:39,932
When I woke up in the hospital,

604
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,537
Nobody could figure out
how I got out of the car.

605
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:48,173
They said it was a miracle.

606
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:51,510
I went back for them.
But it was too late.

607
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:53,812
I couldn't--

608
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,582
I couldn't save them.

609
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,319
When I pulled you out,
I looked at your face.

610
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:03,522
You looked like katherine.
I couldn't believe the resemblance.

611
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,726
After that, I spent months
making sure th you weren't her.

612
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:11,330
I watched you. I learned
everythi that I could about you.

613
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,900
And I saw that you were
nothing like katherine.

614
00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:19,371
And I wanted to leave town,
but, elena, I couldn't.

615
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:22,541
I couldn't leave without knowing you.

616
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:25,311
I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you.

617
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:29,148
I wanted to. But you were so sad.

618
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:35,554
Why do I look like her?

619
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:39,625
Elena, you've been thrgh so much.

620
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:43,963
Why do I look like her,
stefan? What are you not telling me?

621
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,099
It didn't make any sense  me.

622
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,902
You were a gilbert. She was a pierce.

623
00:37:50,003 --> 00:37:52,705
But the resemblance was too similar.

624
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,773
And then I learned the truth.

625
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,677
You were adopted, elena.

626
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:03,282
There you are.

627
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,316
Hey.

628
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:06,418
All right,ook.

629
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:10,356
I know I don't know you,
so don't ask me why I did this.

630
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:13,892
I just, sometimes-- mostly all the time-

631
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,361
I have this need to be right.

632
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:18,097
So I googled and...

633
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:19,398
What is it?

634
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,834
Proof. Sort of.

635
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:31,677
What does this mean?

636
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:33,746
Well, I only went as far back as 1942,

637
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:36,548
And found that there's been
a string of animal attacks

638
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:40,719
Periodically in and around this
town for the past 75 years.

639
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:43,088
It's consistent.

640
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:46,225
In '62, 5 boes found.

641
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,460
In '53, 4 people killed.

642
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:52,698
In '74, 3 people dead.
And there's been 5 this year.

643
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:54,033
All attacked.

644
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:59,204
All suffered major blood loss,
as in drained of blood.

645
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,709
How do you know th?

646
00:39:03,777 --> 00:39:07,880
Your birth certificate
from the city records.

647
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:11,050
It says elena gilbert.
Mystic falls general.

648
00:39:11,117 --> 00:39:14,987
But there's no record of your
mother ever being admitted.

649
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:19,191
There's no record of her
ever being pregnant.

650
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:20,959
What else do you know?

651
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:24,263
For me to go any further, I would've
had to look into the pierce family,

652
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,465
And I couldn do that.
It's too much of a risk.

653
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,134
If seone found out I was
asking about katherine--

654
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:31,670
Listen to me, it doesn't matter.

655
00:39:31,771 --> 00:39:35,674
You are the woman that I love.

656
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,278
I love you.

657
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:05,404
I don't set a lot of rules, elena.

658
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:08,474
Not with you. I trust you
to tell me the truth.

659
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:11,710
Where were you? Why would
you lie to me about it?

660
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,579
I thought that we were closer than that.

661
00:40:13,646 --> 00:40:15,314
Now is not the time you want
to talk to me about lies.

662
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,282
Don't do that.
Don't turn this back on me.

663
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,684
I didn't do anything.

664
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:22,254
Ok, question-- am I apted?

665
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:26,992
I trust you to tell me
the truth too, jenna.

666
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,561
How coulyou not tell me?

667
00:40:29,629 --> 00:40:31,997
I thought we were closer than that.

668
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,901
Elena, didn't-- they asked me not to.

669
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:37,436
I don't want to hear it!

670
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:53,719
Lexi: Love you.

671
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,121
I'm going to be late tonight.
