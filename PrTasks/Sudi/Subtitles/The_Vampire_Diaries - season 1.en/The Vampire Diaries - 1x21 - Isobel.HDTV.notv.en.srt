00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:02,600
Previously on
"the vampire diaries"...

2
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:04,269
Stefan: for over a century,
i have lived in secret

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,770
Until now.
I know the risk.

4
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,138
But i have to know her.

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,307
The original
johnathan gilbert
had an invention

6
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:11,109
That was stolen
by a vampire.
Her name was pearl.

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,810
I gave your device to damon.

8
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,445
Why don't you
ask him for it yourself?

9
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:18,783
Mom! Mama!

10
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,451
My wife isobel
spent her life

11
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:22,654
Researching paranormal
activity in this area.

12
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,522
What have you done to my wife?
I turned her.

13
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,257
Why do i look like her?

14
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:28,293
You were adopted.
This girl showed up,

15
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,094
16 and about to give birth.

16
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:32,096
What else do you know
about her?

17
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:34,098
Just her name--Isobel.
Stop looking.

18
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:36,167
She doesn't want
to know you.

19
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:38,569
She's alive?
Does that mean
she's a--

20
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:42,106
Woman: hello, rick.

21
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,642
Isobel.

22
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:49,247
It's good to see you.

23
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,349
You look good.

24
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,319
I hear that you're
a high-School history teacher?

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,288
How--How is that?

26
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,624
Where have you been,
isobel?

27
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,528
I don't have any reasons
that are gonna comfort you.

28
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:08,666
I don't have any explanations
that are gonna satisfy you.

29
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,635
I wanted this.

30
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:12,003
It's that simple?

31
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:13,538
Yeah.

32
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:17,041
You were supposed to
mourn me and move on.

33
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,644
You were my wife.

34
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:22,180
And i loved you.

35
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,782
How could i not
search for you?

36
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:29,454
Because i wasn't lost, rick.

37
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:35,360
I understand that you know
my daughter elena.
Oh.

38
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:39,931
And i hear that she's been
looking for me.

39
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:42,867
So...

40
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:44,902
I want you to arrange for
a meeting with us.

41
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:49,841
You want me...
[clears throat]

42
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:51,709
To deliver a message?

43
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,611
Heh.
Yeah.

44
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,649
Screw you...

45
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,254
You selfish bitch.

46
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:17,568
What do you want
from me?

47
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,071
I told you.
I'm not gonna
do anything for you.

48
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,979
You better tell elena
that i want to meet,

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,915
Or i'm gonna start
killing the citizens of
this town one by one,

50
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,317
And i'm gonna start with
your history students.

51
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:36,421
Got it?

52
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,622
http://www.addic7ed.com

53
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,710
I'm supposed to help build
the miss mystic float

54
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,779
For the founder's day
parade.

55
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,182
If i don't, i get
the wrath of caroline.

56
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,150
But i wanted
to check in first.

57
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:08,820
Well, i'm doing great.
Thanks for asking.

58
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,022
I'm checking on stefan.
Oh, him?

59
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:13,424
Oh. He's--He's terrible.

60
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:15,493
What's the matter?

61
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:17,995
He's just back to boring,

62
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:21,299
Strait-Laced, off the junk.
You've successfully cured him of

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,601
Anything that was interesting
about his personality.

64
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:26,103
Don't forget who helped me.
I hate myself.

65
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,175
Hey, did uncle john
mention anything to you

66
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:33,644
About my field trip
with the history teacher?

67
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:36,314
No, i've still been
avoiding him.
Why? What's he up to?

68
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,483
I don't know.
But i'd love it if you
could find out for me.

69
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,984
I gotta go. I'm late.

70
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,987
Have fun
with the mystic queen.
I know i did.

71
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:52,196
Elena called.

72
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,442
These are the specs
for the history
department's

73
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,077
Founder's day float.

74
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,880
We're gonna be recreating
the battle of willow creek.

75
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,115
Tyler's been nominated head
of the production design.

76
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:12,617
By who?
By me.

77
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,552
I've seen
your sketches,
and they're good.

78
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,220
Look, i'm not really
into the whole--

79
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:19,257
Yeah, well, you just
pick your team,
be creative, and...

80
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,792
And don't screw up.

81
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:23,995
Great.

82
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:26,063
You want
to help me out with this?

83
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:27,899
Not really, no.

84
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,402
Hey, mr. Saltzman.
Come with me.

85
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,204
We need to talk.

86
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,776
Let's reference
last year's
miss mystic float.

87
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:42,346
This is
what they did last year.

88
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:46,784
And it's exactly
what we don't want to do.

89
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,119
Ew.
Yeah.

90
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,855
Ok. So, what are
we doing?

91
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:53,090
Southern classic elegance.

92
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:55,393
"Gone with the wind"?
How did you know?

93
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:57,194
You channel
scarlett daily.

94
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:58,829
So true.
Yeah.

95
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:03,467
Uhh. Where's elena?
She's supposed to
be helping.

96
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:05,770
I don't know.

97
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:08,105
Ok, what's the deal?
What do you mean?

98
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:09,874
Don't play dumb.

99
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,510
You and elena
are fighting. Spill.

100
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,612
It's nothing.
It's not nothing.

101
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,614
You know, this whole float

102
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:19,550
Is supposed to be about friends
creating something together,

103
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,452
And everyone is fighting.

104
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:23,354
Matt and tyler
hate each other.

105
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:25,189
You and elena
are on the outs.

106
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,191
I--I don't like it.

107
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,796
And i can't fix it
if i don't know what's wrong.

108
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:35,199
I can't talk about it,
caroline. I'm sorry.

109
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:44,675
Damon.
Thanks for coming.

110
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:46,877
Sorry i'm late.
The dog ate my, uh...

111
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,580
Never mind.

112
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:55,386
What's all
the furrowed brows?

113
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,188
I saw isobel
last night.

114
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,858
Isobel's here?
In town?

115
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,103
You're late.

116
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:47,872
I didn't realize
there was a schedule.

117
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,473
What's with the side show?

118
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:51,409
Cherie is a little
jazz singer

119
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,678
That i picked up
in a blues bar
in brooklyn.

120
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,714
And i got the cowboy
at a gay rodeo
in amarillo.

121
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:59,283
He's gay?
Not right now.

122
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:01,018
He's very good
to me.

123
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:04,555
Hey, cherie?
[Speaking french]

124
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,262
I'm teaching them french.

125
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:14,999
Ooh. I can smell
the judgment
coming off of you.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,268
Well, they're people, isobel,
and you're treating them

127
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,270
Like they're dolls.
If we're gonna be partners,

128
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,906
You really have to stop
being such a hater.

129
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,308
We're in a partnership together
because we share a mutual goal.

130
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:27,478
Don't ever confuse that for
an acceptance of your lifestyle.

131
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,946
My lifestyle?

132
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:34,418
So, i assume that you still
don't have the invention.

133
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,153
I'll get it.
I said i would.

134
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:38,823
Uh, you threatened to
expose damon salvatore.

135
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:41,258
That didn't work.
You killed
that pearl lady.

136
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,094
Still no invention.

137
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,963
I really don't think
that your plan
is working, john.

138
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:48,766
Well, you being here
isn't going to help anything.

139
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:53,938
You failed, john.
I'm gonna take it
from here.

140
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:00,177
Damon: did you ask
about une john?

141
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,012
Are they working
together?
No.

142
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:03,347
No, they're not?

143
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,449
No, i didn't ask.
What about the invention?

144
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,785
Didn't ask.
Does she know
about the tomb of vampires?

145
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:10,654
I don't know.
Did words
completely escape you?

146
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:13,090
No, i was a little
too distracted by
my dead vampire wife

147
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,626
To ask any questions.
What did she want?

148
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,461
She wants
to see me, damon.

149
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,833
Alaric is supposed to
arrange a meeting.

150
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,769
We don't know why
or what she wants.

151
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,570
You don't have to see her
if you don't want to.

152
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,707
I don't really have
a choice.

153
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,776
She's threatened
to go on a killing spree.

154
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,182
I take it that's...
not ok with you guys.

155
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:41,452
I want to do it.
I want to meet her.

156
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,954
If i don't,
i know i'll regret it.

157
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:00,337
Thanks.

158
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:04,708
Can you hear me?

159
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:09,380
Thanks for coming.

160
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:12,016
I'm nervous.

161
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:16,554
But i'm happy
that you're here.

162
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,656
Love you.

163
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:38,642
Hello, elena.

164
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,735
You look just like her.
It's eerie.

165
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:46,537
You've met katherine?

166
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:49,072
She found me
after i turned.

167
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:51,375
Genetic curiosity,
i suppose.

168
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:53,810
She would be fascinated
by you.

169
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:56,847
Is that how you can
walk in the day?

170
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:59,016
Katherine helped me
obtain it.

171
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:00,817
Who's my father?

172
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:03,687
Not important.
He was a teenage waste of space.

173
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:05,689
A name would be nice.
It would, wouldn't it?

174
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,425
You ask a lot of questions.

175
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:11,094
Why did you compel
that man to kill himself

176
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:13,197
Right after he told me
to stop looking for you?

177
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:16,333
Traumatic impact.
Wish it would have been
more effective.

178
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,468
Human life means
that little to you?

179
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:20,404
Means nothing to me.

180
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:23,707
It's just part of being
what i am.

181
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:27,311
No. It's not.

182
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:29,479
I know other vampires.
That's not true.

183
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,549
Your boyfriend over there
by the pool table?

184
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,318
Stefan salvatore.

185
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:37,821
Why stefan?
Why didn't you go for damon?

186
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:41,425
Or do enjoy them both?
Like katherine did?

187
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:50,033
we should be in there.

188
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:51,868
No.
Isobel made it clear

189
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:53,737
We're not to
step foot inside.

190
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:55,539
I'm not gonna kill her
in a crowded restaurant.

191
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,441
You're not gonna
kill her, period.

192
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:59,776
She ruined your life,
and you still want
to protect her?

193
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:01,612
She's my wife.

194
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:04,248
Was--Was my wife.

195
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:06,516
I looked for
the woman i married,
but she wasn't there.

196
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:08,518
Whoever that is is...

197
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,520
Cold and detached.
[Scoffs] yeah.

198
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,756
She's given up
her humanity.

199
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:14,524
Yeah, see,
i don't get that.

200
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:17,060
Stefan has his humanity.
He's a good guy.

201
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:19,029
Oh, you're a dick
and you kill people,
but i still see

202
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,265
Something human in you.
But with her,
there was...

203
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,133
There was nothing.

204
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:26,570
You can turn it off...

205
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:28,972
Like a button you can press.
I mean, stefan's different.

206
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:31,108
He--He wants the whole
human experience.

207
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:34,044
He wants to feel every episode
of "how i met your mother,"

208
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:36,013
So he shuts his feelings out.
The problem is,

209
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:38,315
As a vampire,
your instinct is not to feel.

210
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,855
Isobel chose the easier road--

211
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:46,990
No guilt and shame...

212
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:49,192
No regret.
I mean, come on.

213
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:51,261
If you could turn it off,
wouldn't you?
You haven't.

214
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:53,196
Heh. Of course
i have, rick.

215
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:55,332
That's why i'm so fun
to be around.

216
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,103
Elena: why did you
want to meet me?

217
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:02,539
It can't be to just
catch up.

218
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,841
Because i'm curious
about you.

219
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:07,544
But the real reason is

220
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:09,479
I want
what your uncle wants--

221
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,848
Johnathan gilbert's invention.

222
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:13,950
How do you know
my uncle?

223
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,820
I used to spend a lot of time
here when i was younger.

224
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:19,122
John had a crush on me
for years.

225
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:21,658
He was the first one
that told me about vampires.

226
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,493
So, what made you
want to be one?

227
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:26,029
It's a very long list
of reasons, elena,

228
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,898
All of which i'm sure
you've thought about.

229
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,668
That was your first lie.

230
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,571
It's inevitable.
You're gonna get old.

231
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:38,742
Stefan won't.
Forever doesn't last very long

232
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:40,711
When you're human.
I'm sorry,

233
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:42,846
But i don't have
what you're looking for.

234
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:45,215
Sit down.

235
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:47,984
And tell your boyfriend
to walk away.

236
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,761
I want the invention.

237
00:12:57,762 --> 00:12:59,763
I don't have it.
I know that.

238
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:01,898
But damon does.

239
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:03,900
And you're gonna
get it for me.

240
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:05,936
He's not gonna
give it to me.

241
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:08,538
Then the blood
will be on your hands.

242
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,615
It was nice
meeting you, elena.

243
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:53,817
Hey, anna.
Uh, where are you?

244
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:56,653
What's up? Uh...

245
00:13:56,654 --> 00:13:59,489
Give me a call
when you get this.

246
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,160
How is anna?

247
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:05,495
I like that girl.
She has fire.

248
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,597
Uh, i--I don't know.

249
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,433
She won't return
my calls.

250
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:11,435
Girl trouble?

251
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:13,036
No, no trouble.

252
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:15,071
Anna just owes me
a call. That's it.

253
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:18,275
Is it the girl
that i saw you with
at the founder's pageant?

254
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:20,977
You two are gettin'
pretty hot and heavy, huh?

255
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:23,413
When was the last time
you saw her?

256
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:25,315
Why?

257
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:27,150
I'm just
making conversation.

258
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:29,052
No one else in this house
likes me.

259
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:32,255
At least i can talk to you,
especially if you need someone
to talk to about girls.

260
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:34,758
Ugh. Please.

261
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:42,232
So, seriously,
how well do you know anna?

262
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,267
I know anna
extremely well.

263
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,371
Well, know that you can
talko me about anything.

264
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:50,974
I'm here to answer
any questions that you have.

265
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:53,510
I'll help you
in any way i can.

266
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:54,744
Why?

267
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:57,481
'Cause your dad
would want me to.

268
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,620
I'm, uh, i'm good.

269
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:12,362
[Music playing]
uh-Oh, cherie.

270
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:15,365
You won again.
Hope i'm wearing
my good underwear.

271
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,334
Heh heh.

272
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:19,803
It's just on
blast from the past

273
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:21,471
After another.
No, no, no.

274
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:24,608
cherie.

275
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:31,648
Damon: it's good
to see you, isobel.

276
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,050
I was just having fun with
your naughty little minion.

277
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:37,153
How'd you find me?

278
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:39,222
Searched all
the neighborhood
bank-Owned foreclosures

279
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:40,891
And found
the most expensive one.

280
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:42,859
Oh, i should have known.

281
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,794
You were the one
who taught me that.

282
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:46,796
Mm-Hmm.
What are you really doing here?

283
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:49,566
Well, you caused
quite a stir when
you blew into town.

284
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:53,136
Oh.
So, everyone except for
me you would have hurt.

285
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:55,105
I'm so sorry.

286
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:56,940
Did you bring
the device?

287
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:06,216
What are you doing
with john gilbert?

288
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,084
We dated a few times
when we were young.

289
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:10,287
He was a little bit
in love with me.

290
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:12,055
I'm sure one of the many.

291
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:14,558
You know,
this little invention,
what do you want with it?

292
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,760
Oh, me personally?

293
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:20,063
I don't want anything with it.
I'm just doing what i'm told.

294
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,432
You know, damon,
we're on the same si..

295
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,801
[Scoffs] oh, yeah?
Which side is that?

296
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:26,536
Katherine's.

297
00:16:26,537 --> 00:16:29,205
She wants john gilbert
to have the device.

298
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:31,841
And i think that you know
that she's not happy

299
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:34,177
When she doesn't get
what she wants.

300
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:36,079
Why are you doing
her dirty work?

301
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,514
Don't kill the messenger.

302
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:40,350
We both know that you can't
control katherine.

303
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:42,852
She does what she wants.
[Scoffs] so do i.

304
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:45,522
Oh, really, damon? You do?

305
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:51,061
What should we do now?

306
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,268
Oh, yeah.

307
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:00,270
Resurface.

308
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:14,017
Now that i have
your attention, listen up.

309
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:16,820
You do not come into my town,
threaten people i care about.

310
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:19,055
Going after elena--
Bad move.

311
00:17:19,056 --> 00:17:21,391
You leave her alone,
or i will rip you to bits,

312
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:23,827
Because i do believe
in killing the messenger.

313
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,729
[Whispering]
you know why?

314
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,631
Because it sends a message.

315
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,435
Katherine wants something
from me,

316
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:34,571
You tell that little bitch
to come get it herself.

317
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:54,993
Hi.

318
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:57,529
Hey.

319
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,165
I couldn't sleep
last night.

320
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,501
You were
obviously upset
about something,

321
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,536
And i just
walked away.

322
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:06,505
That's not me.

323
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:09,675
That can't be us.

324
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:12,845
You're my friend,
elena.

325
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:15,414
If you need me,
i'm here for you.

326
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:18,283
And i'm sorry
i couldn't show you
that yesterday.

327
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:25,457
I met my birth mother.

328
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:29,294
Oh.

329
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:32,064
Was it...

330
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:33,132
Are you ok?

331
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:45,144
Uhh!

332
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:50,249
Hey, man.

333
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,316
Yeah?

334
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:53,986
So, caroline
tells me

335
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:56,522
You've been
on your own
the past 2 weeks.

336
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,190
Is everything ok?

337
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:01,360
You're asking me
about my mom. Seriously?

338
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:04,196
Look, man, why don't i just
have her give you a call when
she walks back through town?

339
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:05,697
Dude...

340
00:19:05,698 --> 00:19:07,599
That's not
what i meant.

341
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,036
Ok? I'm just
trying to...

342
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:12,771
I don't know
what to say.

343
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:14,573
Well, good, man.
Don't say anything,

344
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:16,642
'Cause you're a dick.
End of story.

345
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:18,944
I know...

346
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,213
Whatever.

347
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:29,922
Bonnie: thanks for
meeting me.

348
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:31,757
I wanted you
to see this.

349
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:33,559
Is that emily's
spell book?

350
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,527
I've been going through it
since grams died.

351
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:38,197
Check this out.

352
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:43,702
That's the vampire compass.
Yeah.

353
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:45,637
According to emily,
johnathan gilbert

354
00:19:45,638 --> 00:19:47,906
Never actually
succeeded in
inventing anything.

355
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:51,043
Emily secretly
spelled them all
with magic--

356
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:52,444
Compass...

357
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,781
Rings...

358
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:01,053
And the mystery device
you told me about.

359
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:03,121
Yeah, that's it--

360
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:05,991
Well, part of it.
Damon only has the one piece.

361
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:08,994
Emily pledged
her loyalty to katherine.

362
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:12,764
But she couldn't stand by
and watch innocent people
get killed.

363
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:15,100
This was the only way
she could think of
to help--

364
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:18,904
To let johnathan gilbert
believe he'd actually
invented these devices.

365
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,572
Does it say what it does?

366
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:30,716
Are you sure this is
what isobel wants?

367
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:32,384
Yeah, i'm sure. Why?

368
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:36,355
This is a weapon...

369
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:38,824
Against vampires.

370
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,601
Elena!

371
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:51,937
Hey. Um...
have you seen stefan?

372
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:53,438
I need to find him.

373
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:56,041
No, not lately. Listen.
Um, you have a second?

374
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:58,410
Uh, yeah. What's up?
What's going on?

375
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:01,313
Well, it's anna.
I left her
all these messages,

376
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:03,916
And she hasn't
gotten back to me--
Not even a text.

377
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,484
Anna?

378
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:07,953
I didn't know that you guys
were still friends.

379
00:21:07,954 --> 00:21:09,588
We're more than friends.

380
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:11,924
Look, something could be
seriously wrong.

381
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:14,293
And if you know anything,
you gotta tell me.

382
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,562
I haven't talked
to her, jer.

383
00:21:17,563 --> 00:21:19,464
Are you lying to me
right now?

384
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:21,300
Why would you say that?

385
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:24,369
'Cause that's what
you do, elena. You lie.
You lie about everything.

386
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,338
I know what anna is.

387
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,273
And i know
that you know.

388
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:29,741
So, tell me.

389
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:31,843
Do you have any idea
where she is?

390
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,781
No.

391
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,186
But jer...

392
00:21:41,187 --> 00:21:43,121
Jeremy. Wait.

393
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:44,423
Jeremy!

394
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,627
Isobel.

395
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:52,364
What are you doing here?
I'm your mother, elena.

396
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:55,033
I want to be
more involved in your life.

397
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:58,904
I don't want you in my life.
I understand that.

398
00:21:58,905 --> 00:22:01,206
You already have
a lot of people
that you care about.

399
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:02,674
But i've been studying.

400
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:05,010
Let's see if i got this right.

401
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:08,947
There is the witchy
st friend bonnie.

402
00:22:08,948 --> 00:22:11,750
Gonna stay away
from that one.

403
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:12,918
Oh...

404
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:15,387
Sad little brother jeremy.

405
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:17,889
And there's caroline--

406
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,791
Obnoxious caroline.

407
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,827
I got all of my info
from her, by the way.

408
00:22:21,828 --> 00:22:25,197
She had no idea
who i was, and she
wouldn't stop yapping.

409
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:27,532
Oh.

410
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,267
There's matt--

411
00:22:29,268 --> 00:22:32,771
Friend, ex,
yappy's future ex.

412
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:35,273
Lots of connections there.
Matt's not involved with us.

413
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:37,209
He's involved with you.
Isn't he?

414
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,378
Look, you shouldn't
be here.

415
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:41,380
You need to leave.
No.

416
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,982
I have some friends
here, too. Look.

417
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:47,252
See that man over there
standing next to matt
by the float?

418
00:22:47,253 --> 00:22:50,722
His name's frank.
He's very handsome.

419
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:52,524
And he's also very handy.

420
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:55,060
And he noticed that the axle
was kind of rusted,

421
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:58,163
Which is very dangerous.
So, all you have to do

422
00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:00,999
Is apply a little bit
of pressure, and--

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,401
No!

424
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:04,770
Aah! Uhh!

425
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,239
Boy: hey, get this trailer up!
Come on, guys,
lift it up, please!

426
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,607
Give me a hand!

427
00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:10,709
Uhh! Aah!
Come on, lift.

428
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,745
Oh!
Come on!

429
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:15,547
Aah!

430
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,251
Call for help.

431
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,752
Caroline: ok.

432
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:22,954
Why are you doing this?
I'm showing you how easy it is

433
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:24,956
To hurt the people
that you care about.

434
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:26,291
You're doing this
just because of

435
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:27,626
Johnathan gilbert's
invention?

436
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,361
Hand it over
and the fun will stop.

437
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:31,196
I told you, damon's not
gonna give it to me.

438
00:23:31,197 --> 00:23:34,266
And i think that you
underestimate how much
damon cares about you.

439
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:36,334
He'll kill you
before he gives it up.

440
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:38,637
Is that before or after
i kill your brother jeremy?

441
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,774
Elena: jeremy?

442
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:44,242
Jeremy!

443
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,553
The ambulance is saying
15-20 minutes.

444
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,021
I have my car. I can take him
to the hospital.

445
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:54,090
Caroline can take me.
I didn't drive.

446
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:55,591
Then i'll wait.
It's fine.

447
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,593
You will not wait!
Ok, you need
to see a doctor.

448
00:23:57,594 --> 00:23:59,762
Tyler's driving.
End of story.

449
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:03,099
Go!
I'll bring my car around.

450
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,442
I see you're packing.
That's a good sign.

451
00:24:12,443 --> 00:24:14,410
Won't be long now.

452
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,379
Did you get the missing piece?
Where is it?

453
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,147
I don't have it yet.

454
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:20,316
Then why did you
call me here?

455
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:22,819
'Cause i have
the next best thing.

456
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:30,159
What the hell are you doing?
Getting what i want.

457
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,161
Yeah, but he's my nephew.

458
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:34,697
And you're gonna let him go
right this second.

459
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:36,866
The gaudy ring
on your finger--

460
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:39,202
It comes off.
Come on.

461
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:41,370
Come on, isobel.
I--I know you.

462
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:42,972
Ok?

463
00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:45,374
It's me, john.
You can't hurt a kid.

464
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,144
I'll kill him
to prove you wrong.
Really?

465
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:50,213
Are you that far gone?

466
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:52,348
Look, i know you've changed.

467
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,885
Ok? But the old isobel
is in there somewhere still.

468
00:24:55,886 --> 00:24:57,353
Isn't she?

469
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:00,857
Come on. Let him go.

470
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:01,958
Ok.

471
00:25:18,742 --> 00:25:20,209
Ok.

472
00:25:22,746 --> 00:25:24,881
Isobel: nice try.

473
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:27,984
We'll see how you do
without this.

474
00:25:36,593 --> 00:25:38,127
Where's the device?

475
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:39,462
Damon has it.

476
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:41,464
He's gonna be difficult
to reason with.

477
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:44,000
Then we'll--We'll
go go him.
I'll talk to him.

478
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,303
He's not just gonna
hand it ov, , pecially if
it's harmful to vampires.

479
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:52,074
What if it's not?

480
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,580
Damon: absolutely not.

481
00:25:57,581 --> 00:25:59,916
Just hear me out.
I'm not gonna give the device

482
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:02,185
To isobel so she can give it
to john who's gonna
turn around and kill me.

483
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,187
I like being
a living dead person.

484
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,088
But it'll be useless.
Bonnie can take
its power away.

485
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:07,356
I don't trust her.

486
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,525
I can remove
the original spell.

487
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,461
John and isobel
will never know.
No.

488
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:14,831
No, i'll get jeremy my own way.
Mm-Hmm.
Stefan: really?

489
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:16,499
How are you gonna
do that? H?

490
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,034
Because isobel
is a vampire,

491
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,736
And jeremy can be dead
the second you
walk in the door.

492
00:26:22,105 --> 00:26:24,907
Are you even up for this?
I mean, no offense.

493
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:28,177
You're no emily bennett.
Emily knew what she was doing.

494
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:30,513
I've been practicing.
It's not piano lessons, honey.

495
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:34,283
What's your
favorite book?

496
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:36,085
What?
Name a book,

497
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:37,386
Any book.

498
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,922
Name a book.

499
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:41,757
How about...

500
00:26:41,758 --> 00:26:44,427
"Call of the wild,"
jack london?

501
00:26:54,137 --> 00:26:55,438
Jack london.

502
00:26:57,341 --> 00:26:58,808
Great parlor trick.

503
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:00,176
Elena:
we're doing this, damon.

504
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:02,178
And we're gonna do it
my way.

505
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:04,280
Now, give me the device.

506
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:06,082
We're wasting time.

507
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:09,986
I don't trust you.
I tried to kill you.

508
00:27:09,987 --> 00:27:12,889
Hmm. You're right.
You can't trust me.

509
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,757
But you can trust me.

510
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:33,809
Thank you.

511
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,781
Here you go.

512
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:46,449
Thank you.

513
00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:49,619
What is she after?

514
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,292
Your ancestor
invented a weapon--

515
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:59,195
A device that's extremely
harmful to vampires.

516
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:02,465
We've been trying to get it.
Why?

517
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:06,169
'Cause there's a group of
vampires from a long time ago

518
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,071
That wants revenge
on this town.

519
00:28:10,541 --> 00:28:12,208
But why--

520
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:15,111
Why would a vampire
help you kill
other vampires?

521
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:18,047
She has her own reasons
for wanting them dead.

522
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,782
Look, jeremy,

523
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,552
No one ever thought
vampires would return
to this town--

524
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:24,487
Not in modern times.

525
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:26,355
But they have.

526
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,658
And we have to destroy them.
All of them?

527
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:31,694
No--There are some
good ones out there.

528
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:33,596
There's no such thing.

529
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:36,499
I don't believe that.

530
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,568
Well, your dad did.

531
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:41,537
And as his son, that should
mean something to you.

532
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,841
How did my father
know about all this?

533
00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:48,377
Who do you think taught me
about the family history?

534
00:29:27,784 --> 00:29:29,719
Done.

535
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:34,123
Damon: great.

536
00:29:34,124 --> 00:29:36,225
Now what?
Now we give it
to isobel.

537
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:47,303
[Bell ringing]

538
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,755
Where's the device?

539
00:30:05,756 --> 00:30:06,889
Where's my brother?

540
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,524
This isn't
a negotiation.

541
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:10,793
Where's
the invention?

542
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:12,328
Where is my brother?

543
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:14,797
Do you really think
that i came alone?

544
00:30:17,768 --> 00:30:20,636
Do you really think
that i came alone?

545
00:30:26,777 --> 00:30:29,545
For god sakes,
call home.

546
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:30,846
What?

547
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:34,383
Call home, ask to speak
to your brother jeremy.

548
00:30:39,623 --> 00:30:41,123
Hello?

549
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:43,859
Jeremy. Are you ok?

550
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:46,262
Yeah, yeah, i'm fine.

551
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,598
Uncle john, uh,
hit his head.

552
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,099
It was an accident.

553
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,501
And we're all laughing.
[Chuckles]

554
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:55,237
Yeah, but, um,
i'm ok.

555
00:30:55,238 --> 00:30:56,772
I'll be home soon,
all right?

556
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,474
Yeah.

557
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,553
You were never
going to hurt him.

558
00:31:10,554 --> 00:31:13,823
No. I was going
to kill him.

559
00:31:13,824 --> 00:31:16,959
Don't look
for any redeeming
qualities in me.

560
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,195
I don't have any.

561
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:20,997
But you took
a risk with damon.

562
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:23,065
How did you know
that he was going
to give it to me?

563
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:24,634
'Cause he's
in love with you.

564
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:40,483
Thank you.

565
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,451
For what?

566
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:46,322
For being such
a monumental disappointment.

567
00:31:47,858 --> 00:31:51,494
It keeps the memory
of my real mother
perfectly intact.

568
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:53,062
Good-Bye, elena.

569
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:57,967
As long as you have
a salvatore on each arm,

570
00:31:57,968 --> 00:32:01,303
You're doomed.

571
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:03,973
Katherine was smart.

572
00:32:03,974 --> 00:32:06,575
She got out.

573
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:09,078
But we all know that
you're not katherine.

574
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:29,699
Sorry.

575
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:52,250
Hey, it's anna.
Leave a message.

576
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:57,755
Jeremy, we have
to talk about this.

577
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:00,024
No, we really don't.

578
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,826
I don't know
what anna told you,

579
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:04,729
But there are things
that you need to know.

580
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,430
Yeah?

581
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,865
Because...

582
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:10,401
I'm pretty sure
that your journal
covered it.

583
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:13,204
You read my journal?

584
00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:15,840
And save me
the speech about
invasion of privacy,

585
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:17,942
Because i read
a section about damon
erasing my memory,

586
00:33:17,943 --> 00:33:19,610
About what happened
to vicki.

587
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:22,847
Jeremy, please,
you don't understand.

588
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:25,383
The night that vicki died,

589
00:33:25,384 --> 00:33:28,152
It was like mom and dad
died all over again.

590
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:30,021
It was all over your face.

591
00:33:30,022 --> 00:33:32,623
And it hurt so much
to see you like that.

592
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:33,858
I just wanted
to take away your pain,

593
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:36,294
I'm so sorry.
Just get out.

594
00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:37,628
No, jeremy--

595
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:39,830
Elena!

596
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,199
Just get out.

597
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,968
Please.

598
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,815
Jer, i--

599
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:21,872
What do you want?

600
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:25,142
I totally get it.

601
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:28,012
You here as a history teacher.

602
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:29,847
It's good.

603
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,148
What the hell
are you doing?

604
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:32,383
You act like
you don't care,

605
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:34,485
And yet here you are
hunting me down.

606
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,025
I'm leaving.

607
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:42,893
I just thought
i'd say good-Bye.

608
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,595
Well, you couldn't be
bothered the first time,

609
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:46,864
So why now?

610
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:48,399
You hate me, good.

611
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,568
Does that make it
easier for you?

612
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:52,036
I mean, what is
the whole point
of this exercise?

613
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:53,604
What did you expect?

614
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,406
You spent alalalisyingngngngngn,

615
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:56,874
What did you think
you would find?

616
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,910
The woman
who gave me this...

617
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:01,278
I mean, you act
like you don't care.

618
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,114
But you cared enough
to protect me
after you left.

619
00:35:03,115 --> 00:35:06,484
I was a different person
back then.

620
00:35:06,485 --> 00:35:07,652
Coffs] right,
right, right.

621
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:09,286
And that person is gone.

622
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:12,723
The woman i married,
the woman i loved,
she's just--She's gone.

623
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:17,094
You expect me
to believe that?

624
00:35:22,234 --> 00:35:24,268
What are you doing?

625
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:25,369
Well, i'm ring-Free.

626
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,837
I'm vervain-Free,

627
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:29,173
So either kill me
or compel me,

628
00:35:29,174 --> 00:35:31,208
Because...

629
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,411
I don't believe it.

630
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:37,481
Not for a second.

631
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,285
[Grunts]
i wanted this.

632
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:43,854
I needed this.

633
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,794
And i'm going
to regret it forever.

634
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:55,499
This was my mistake.

635
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,102
Not yours.

636
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:05,810
You are not going
to remember this.

637
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,845
When you think
of our marriage,

638
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:09,413
You are going to have
such fond

639
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:12,183
And beautiful memories.

640
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:13,751
But that's in the past now,

641
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:16,353
And your heart's
free of me.

642
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:19,256
It's better this way.

643
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:23,394
Good-Bye, rick.

644
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,835
Anna? Hey,
what are you doing here?

645
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:08,105
My mother.

646
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,742
She's dead.

647
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:13,544
What?

648
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:18,149
She was killed.

649
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,151
Oh, my god, anna...

650
00:37:20,152 --> 00:37:22,086
Hey.

651
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:23,988
Hey, i'm so sorry.

652
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:27,124
I know i'm not supposed
to be here,

653
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,760
But i don't have
anywhere else to go.

654
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:35,533
Hey, it's ok.

655
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,776
Would you like one?

656
00:37:45,777 --> 00:37:47,444
Ahem.

657
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:49,380
Say it.

658
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:52,683
Whatever it is,
purge, get it out.

659
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:56,120
It's about what isobel said.

660
00:37:56,121 --> 00:37:57,121
What about it?

661
00:37:57,122 --> 00:37:59,957
Well, i know that
you and elena bonded,

662
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:02,259
And i know that
she cares about you, and, uh,

663
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,928
I know you care about her.

664
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:06,964
Well, this is going
in an interesting
direction.

665
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:10,568
I'm just concerned
about elena being hurt.

666
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:12,169
She considers you a friend.

667
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,005
Same here. Elena's
a very good friend.

668
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:18,542
Actually,
she might qualify
as my only friend.

669
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:20,411
Is that a problem?

670
00:38:20,412 --> 00:38:23,480
So, at the risk
of sounding like a, um,

671
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:25,416
Like a jealous boyfriend--

672
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:26,951
Oh, there's no risk.

673
00:38:26,952 --> 00:38:28,152
You do.

674
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:30,654
History will not be
repeating itself

675
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:32,923
Where elena's concerned.

676
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:36,126
Do you understand
what i'm saying?

677
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:39,129
Sure.

678
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,002
Do you...
understand?

679
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:47,504
Hey, whatever you say, man.

680
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:49,473
I mean, honestly,
we're just friends.

681
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:50,941
And as her friend,
i wasn't looking forward

682
00:38:50,942 --> 00:38:52,476
To telling her
the truth, anyway.

683
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:54,545
So, i'll let you do it.

684
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:57,481
What truth?

685
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,316
About john.

686
00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:01,886
'Cause i know you guys
don't like to keep
secrets from each other.

687
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:03,187
What are you
talking about?

688
00:39:03,188 --> 00:39:04,555
Am i the only one
around here

689
00:39:04,556 --> 00:39:06,390
Who has the ability
to put two and two together?

690
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,826
Isobel. Hello?

691
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:13,130
She dated john
when she was 15.

692
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:15,199
She gets pregnant,
and ends up

693
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,201
At the doctor's office
of john's brother.

694
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:19,136
Now, what do you think
is john's role is
in all of this, huh?

695
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:20,271
I mean, go ahead,
think about it.

696
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:23,140
I'll wait. You get it?
You there yet? Hmm?

697
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:26,310
So, you think
that john

698
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:28,545
Is elena's father?

699
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:29,580
Ding ding ding!
[Scoffs]

700
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:31,849
What proof
do you have?

701
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,851
I don't need any proof.
I have the dna tests

702
00:39:33,852 --> 00:39:35,653
For john, elena,
and [indistinct].

703
00:39:35,654 --> 00:39:39,757
But i know how well
you deal with these
big bombshells, so...

704
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:41,892
Sleep tight.

705
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:44,395
Oh, and when you do
tell elena,

706
00:39:44,396 --> 00:39:47,164
And she needs a friend
to talk to about anything...

707
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,134
I'm here for her.

708
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:04,481
Hello?

709
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:05,683
On your doorstep,

710
00:40:05,684 --> 00:40:07,651
You'll find what
you've been looking for.

711
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:08,752
And my ring?

712
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:11,255
Don't screw this up.

713
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:20,831
I got it.

714
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,333
I won't fail.

715
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:23,934
You better not.

716
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:25,502
Katherine wants

717
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:27,638
All of those
tomb vampires dead.

718
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:30,507
And i want to add
two more to that list.

719
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,344
Let me guess.

720
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:35,446
Stefan and damon.

721
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,147
I don't want
this life for her.

722
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:38,749
Well, it was always
a part of the plan.

723
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,551
Consider them gone.

724
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:43,253
She's our daughter, john.

725
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:45,489
We owe that to her.

726
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:48,192
I know.

727
00:40:57,502 --> 00:41:00,070
So you're not going
to tell me what happened?

728
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,245
I did something bad,
caroline.

729
00:41:08,246 --> 00:41:11,081
And i lied about it.

730
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:14,151
To who?

731
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:17,021
To elena.

732
00:41:17,022 --> 00:41:19,690
I pretended
to do something

733
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:22,426
I didn't really do.

734
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:25,062
What are you talking about?

735
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:28,899
I couldn't do what
she wanted me to do.

736
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,267
It wasn't right.

737
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:31,802
Grams would have
never done it,

738
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:34,838
So i couldn't,
either.

739
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:37,841
But when elena
finds out...

740
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:41,412
She's never going
to forgive me.
