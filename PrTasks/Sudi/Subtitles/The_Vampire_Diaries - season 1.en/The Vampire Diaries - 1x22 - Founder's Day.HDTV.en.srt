1
00:00:00,703 --> 00:00:02,657
Woman: Previously on
"the vampire diaries"...

2
00:00:02,657 --> 00:00:04,553
Stefan: For over a century,
I have lived in secret

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,413
Until now.
I know the risk.

4
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:07,634
But I have to know her.

5
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:09,460
Elena--she's a dead ringer
for katherine.

6
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:11,695
I want the invention.
Don't have it.

7
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:14,232
But damon does.
And yore gonna
get it for me.

8
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:15,799
I'm not gonna
give the device to isobel

9
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:18,002
So she can give it
to john who's gonna
turn around and kill me.

10
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,604
But it'll be useless
bonnie can take
the spell off.

11
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,476
You took
a risk with damon.

12
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:27,977
How did you know
that he was going
to give it to me?

13
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:29,946
'causee's
in love with you.

14
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:34,984
I couldn't do what
she wanted me to do.

15
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:36,453
It wasn't right.

16
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,256
But when elena
finds out...

17
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:42,158
She's never going
to forgive me.

18
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:15,189
Ow. This dress hurts.

19
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:17,791
Humph.
Suck it in, baby.

20
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:21,128
[music playing]

21
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:23,564
[indistinct chattering]

22
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:29,168
Mrs. Lockwood:
No, no, no, no.

23
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:30,769
This lineup
is all wrong.

24
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:33,506
The marching band
should be in front of
the historicalociety.

25
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:35,174
Matt, time to get
on your float.

26
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:39,145
Boys, I asked you
to put the chair
on the founder's float.

27
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:41,981
Ladies, time to get
on your float.

28
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,350
Look at you,
all retro.

29
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:46,951
What are you
doing here?

30
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,987
Why wouldn't I be here?

31
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,788
Bonnie deactivated
the gilbert inventn.

32
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:54,593
Isobel's gone. Heh.
And it's founder's day.

33
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,730
I'm here to eat cotton candy
and steal your girl.

34
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,465
Don't start with me, damon.
Oh, you started it, stefan,

35
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:04,301
With that whole "I'm insecure,
leave ena alone" speech.

36
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,570
I'm just enjoying that.

37
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:08,405
As long as you heard it.

38
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:10,007
Huh? What?

39
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,708
[chuckles]

40
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,710
You have
noense of humor, stefan.

41
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:17,313
Actually, I just
have no see of
damon humor.

42
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:19,449
Damon humor--
hey, look.

43
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:20,850
I get it. I get it.

44
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,785
I'm the better, hotter,
superior choice,

45
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:25,054
And you're scared now that
katherine's out of the picture

46
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:27,290
That I'm gonna turn
all my attention to elena.

47
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:30,360
But don't worry.
Elena is not katherine.

48
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:33,228
You're right.
She's not.

49
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:14,169
Anna.

50
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:18,674
Look at you.

51
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:21,075
Heh. I know,
it's stupid, huh?

52
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:23,977
I'm part of
e parade.
But how are you?

53
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:26,046
I've been--I've been
so worried,

54
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:28,382
And I feel awful.

55
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,950
Why?

56
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:33,387
You didn't kill my mother.
Your uncle did.

57
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,556
Are you sure
it was him?

58
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:37,524
Who else
would have done it?

59
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:41,895
He doesn't
understand, anna.
It's who he is.

60
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:43,797
He hates
all vampires.

61
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:46,366
He's just doing
what he thinks is right.

62
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,301
Are you defending him?

63
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:51,105
No. No way.

64
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:52,671
It's just--

65
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,208
I do understand
where he's coming from.

66
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,309
He's convinced
all the tomb vampis

67
00:03:57,377 --> 00:04:00,880
Want revenge
on this town,
and he's just...

68
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,882
He's trying
to protect it.

69
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,218
They do want revenge.

70
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:07,120
Or, at least, they did.

71
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:10,088
But that's why
we separated from them.

72
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:14,392
My mom wasn't after venge.
She just wanted her life back.

73
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:18,630
I haveo get out
of this town, jeremy.

74
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:20,698
You're leaving?

75
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:24,034
But I've been thinking.
You could come with me.

76
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:26,871
I could turn you.
I mean, you said
you wanted me to.

77
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:29,073
Here.

78
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,108
It's my blood.

79
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:33,844
If you die with it
in your system,
you'll come back.

80
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,149
Anna--
I know you,

81
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,949
What it's like for you--

82
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:42,852
Being alone,
always feeling empty inside,

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,821
No one to understand.

84
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:48,391
But when youe a vampire,
you don't have to feel that way.

85
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,559
You can shut it off.

86
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,295
I can show you how.

87
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:59,067
I wanted to. I did.

88
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,708
But I don't think
I ca

89
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:09,011
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:16,650
John?

91
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:18,686
Is--is that even posble?

92
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:22,323
Well, there's no proof,
but he dated isobel
when she was a teenager,

93
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,326
And he was the one who
brought her to your dad's
office for the delivery.

94
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,994
My who life,
I've never liked this man.

95
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,362
I...

96
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,531
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just--

97
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,433
I wanted to te you
before damon dropped
it on you

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,135
In some typically
inappropriate way.

99
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:38,104
No, I'm happy
that you told me. I just...

100
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,241
I really hope
that it's not true.

101
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:45,410
What am I supposed to do?
Do I just...

102
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,281
Confront him and say,
"are you mbiological father?"

103
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,051
I guess
when you're ready.

104
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,486
I'm never gonna be ready.

105
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,224
Stefan, I have enough problems
with the family that
I actually care about.

106
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,492
Jeremy hates me,
and why wouldn't he?

107
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,728
My journal gave him
every single reason to.

108
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:05,663
He's just hu.
He's confused.

109
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,798
He's never gonna
forgivme for vicki,

110
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,901
For taking away his memory,
for lying to him.

111
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,737
He's your brother.
He'll forgive you.

112
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,973
Just give him some time.

113
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,574
Bonnie: Say cheese.
Wait. Hide your cast.

114
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:20,443
It's not era-appropriate.
Seriously? Uhh.

115
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,812
Yes. [giggles]
ok. All right.

116
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,416
[shutter clicks]
I want one with bonnie now.

117
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:27,885
Here, I can take it.

118
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:32,288
I'll be on the float.

119
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:33,622
Uhh.

120
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,624
I said I was sorry.

121
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:38,827
You made out with his mother,
and then you beat him to a pulp.

122
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:42,331
You're gonna have to do
a little bit better than sorry.

123
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:45,501
Elena: Jeremy.

124
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:47,736
Heh. I was wondering
where you were.

125
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:49,237
You look great.

126
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:51,072
You guys did
a really great job
on the float.

127
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,041
Go away, elena.
Jeremy, come on, please.

128
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:55,476
I don't want it to be
like this between us.

129
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:57,712
Why don't you have damon
erase my memory again?

130
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,548
Then I can go back to
being your in-the-dark
little brother.

131
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:02,284
Jer, please.

132
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:04,919
Just don't.

133
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:06,320
You n't fix this
that easily.

134
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:10,057
Something like this
doesn't just get fixed.

135
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,698
[crowd cheering]
let's give a big hand

136
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:22,068
To the mystic falls
high school marching ban

137
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:25,571
[band playing]

138
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:34,113
Mrs. Lockwood:
And for a little local history,

139
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:36,614
Mr. Saltzman's students
have recreated

140
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:39,384
Virginia's
battle of willow creek.

141
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,125
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

142
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:50,128
Our stunning
miss mystic falls court

143
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:52,296
And their handsome escorts.

144
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:55,199
[cheering intensifies]

145
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:04,408
This is caroline forbes,
miss mystic falls.

146
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:08,078
Mrs. Lockwood:
Aren't they beautiful?

147
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:28,563
What do you want?

148
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,532
Just watching
the parade.

149
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,302
Where are you going?
Away from you.

150
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,769
I want to say
something to you.

151
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:37,272
Just leave me alone.
Thank you.

152
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,574
The device
that emily spelled
could have killed me.

153
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:43,744
I don't take whayou did
lightly, so...

154
00:08:43,812 --> 00:08:45,480
Thank you.

155
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:49,317
I did it for elena.
I know that.

156
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:51,386
But I'm still
very grateful.

157
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:53,454
And...

158
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:55,689
I owe you.

159
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:01,594
Enjoy the parade.

160
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:09,403
Mrs. Lockwood: Let's hear it
for the stic falls
high school football team.

161
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,938
All rit! Let's show them
our support, everybody.

162
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,947
This is the key.

163
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,017
Once inserted,
the device will be activated.

164
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:28,087
It will work only once
for an estimated time
of 5 minutes.

165
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:29,688
Mayor lockwood:
Yes. How does it work?

166
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:32,357
It's a high-pitched frequency
that humans can't he..

167
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,627
Any vampire
within a 5-block radius
will be incapacitated,

168
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:37,195
Exposing them.

169
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:39,229
At that time,
the sheriff's v5 depies

170
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:41,165
Will inject them with vervain
and bring themere,

171
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,667
Where we'll finish them off.

172
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:44,569
And you're certain
they're attacking tonight?

173
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,071
I had a source.
One of the vampires
from the tomb--

174
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:48,573
He confirmed the attack.

175
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,075
Man: Everybody listen up.

176
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:53,210
The plan stays the same.

177
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:55,045
We wait
till the fireworks start.

178
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:57,080
Ununtil then, blend in.

179
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:59,115
Stay a part
of the celebration.

180
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,817
They'll never see us coming.

181
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:04,420
They want revenge for what
our ancestors did in 1864,

182
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:06,155
Which makes us their targets.

183
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:08,024
This area here is the stage.

184
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:10,659
This is where
the founding famies
are gonna be.

185
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,462
Any questions?

186
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,497
We're taking
an enormous risk.

187
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:18,166
We're talking about
our families, john.

188
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,038
Anna.

189
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:25,307
What are you
doing here?

190
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,043
It's the only way
to draw them out
and kill them...

191
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,112
All of them.

192
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,033
I like you better
like this.

193
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:50,102
The period look, it...

194
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:52,369
Didn't suit you.

195
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:54,706
Is that an insult?

196
00:10:54,773 --> 00:10:57,308
Actually, elena,
is a compliment

197
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,376
Of the highest order.

198
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:04,348
Look, I know
stefan is worried

199
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,484
About our friendship.

200
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:08,318
Did he mention
something to you, too?

201
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:10,687
No.Idid he mention
something to you?

202
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:13,323
No. Nothing worth repeating.

203
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,959
So, I think
you should stop with
the flirty little comments

204
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:17,794
And that eye thing
that you do.

205
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:19,863
What eye thing?

206
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:23,532
Heh.

207
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,702
Don't make me regret
being your friend.

208
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,805
Ok?

209
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,785
I don't believe
that we can't fix this.

210
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:46,287
I lied. I was wrong.

211
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:48,790
But you're my brother,
jer, and I love you.

212
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,725
And I have to fix it.

213
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,227
So, just tell me.
What can I do?

214
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:58,699
You can go to hell, elena.

215
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,934
[music playing]

216
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:19,052
Damon, mockingly:
I have so many emotions,

217
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,453
But I don't have any way
to express them.

218
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,556
Being a teenager is so hard.
You dick.

219
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,725
You do not
talk to me like that.
I'm not your sister.

220
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:27,993
And from now on,
don't talk to your sister
that way, either.

221
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,662
So, what, you're gonna
kill me just 'cause
I hurt ele's's feelings?

222
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,731
Cut her some slack.

223
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,733
She erased my memories.

224
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,267
No, I did.

225
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,171
She was protectingou.

226
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:42,240
It wasn't
her call to make.

227
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,508
[panting]

228
00:12:44,576 --> 00:12:47,578
Let go of me
before I cau a scene.

229
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,814
You'll be unconscious
before you even
got a word out.

230
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,215
Let him go.

231
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:55,219
You all right?

232
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:57,021
Yeah.

233
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,089
What my brother
is trying to say

234
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:01,424
Ison't blame elena
for this.

235
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:04,160
Damon turned vicki.

236
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:06,863
I killed her.

237
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:10,934
She was a threat to you,
and she was a threat
to your sister.

238
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:15,938
I'm sorry that it happened.
I wish that it hadn't.

239
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:20,508
Shouldn't have
made me forget.

240
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:24,479
Good cop, bad cop--
I like it.

241
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:26,915
What are you doing? Hmm?
He was being a punk.

242
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:29,317
Elena's relationship
with her brother is
none of your business.

243
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:31,052
You stay out of it.
Oh, the's only one

Oh, my bad. I'm sorry.

245
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:35,489
Get over yourself.

246
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:37,725
We both know that
you're not doing this
for e right reasons.

247
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:40,862
See, there you go with
th little jealousy act again.

248
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,164
Uh, wh-what are
the right reasons, stefan?

249
00:13:43,232 --> 00:13:44,966
Enlighten me. Please.
Well, see, damon,

250
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,868
It's only real when
it comes from your desire

251
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:50,571
To do the right thing
for nothing in return.

252
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,573
Right. Yeah.
And I know that that is

253
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,475
An entirely
foreign concept to you.

254
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,211
I completely understand
how you wouldn't get it.

255
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,383
You wa to use
our town as bait?

256
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,151
It's too dangerous.
It's insane.

257
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:07,253
Wee e gone over the plans
with your deputies.

258
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:09,088
They're all on board.

259
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:10,456
You've gone
behind me?

260
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:12,858
Yeah, because wenew that's
exactly how you'd react.

261
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:15,161
Our children are here.
Liz, we need to do this.

262
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:18,063
We have no choice.
This is the reason
for the secret council.

263
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:22,867
Our founding fathers
created the secret council
for just this rpose.

264
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:31,209
I'm the sheriff.
It's my call.

265
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:33,412
And I say no.

266
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:36,914
Richard, let me speak
to the sheriff alone.

00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:44,488
John, you're not
thinking clearly.

They think
I'm m th them, but I'm not.

274

They want
the founding families dead.

275
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,992
When is this
supposed to happen?

276
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,595
When the fireworks start.

They're already here,

Remember, we don't know
which of them
ingest vervain.

284
00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:56,849
It's not about the feed.

285
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,950
It's about the kill.

286
00:15:59,018 --> 00:16:01,186
You know what to do.

287
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:11,562
Rick.
Yeah.

You keep those
nifty little
vamp weapons

In the car?
Yeah. Why do you ask?

290
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:18,002
Because this square
is crawling with
tomb vampires.

291
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:20,004
I think we might
need a stake or two.

wants to call home--

And we have the founders
to thank for that.

to dedicate this evening's

00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:46,130
What's going on?
What's happening?

348
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:48,031
My head.
What?

349
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,033
My head.

350
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:54,105
Uhh! Aah!

351
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,507
Aah!
What's wrong?

352
00:19:56,575 --> 00:20:00,009
Anna.
[sobbing] please make it stop.

353
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:13,422
[squealing continues]
what the hell is that?

354
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,023
What's the matter?

355
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,259
That noise.
Wait, what noise?

356
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:21,263
Oh.
Whoa.

357
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:23,064
Tyler. Tyler!
Aah!

358
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,900
Aah! Aah! Unh!
Dude! Hey!

360
00:20:28,238 --> 00:20:30,304
Tyler!
Uhh!

361
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:32,173
Aah!

362
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,543

364
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:41,282
Stefan.
Ow.

365
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:44,385
I got this one.
There's one over there.

366
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,886
Take this. Go. Go. Go!

367
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,024
I don't know what happened.
He jt dropped.

368
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:54,093
He's not the only one.
Cops are grabbing everyone
whs gone down,

369
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:56,763
Injecting them
with vervain.
What?

370
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:01,867
They're rounding up
the vampires.

371
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,536
Please help him.

372
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:13,011
Aah! Uhh! My head!
[sobbing]

373
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,447
Hey, I got one.

374
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:17,915
What a you doing?

375
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:20,117
What a you doing?
Hey! Leave her alone!

376
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:21,786
Hey!
[sobbing]

377
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:23,555
What are you doing?
Hey! Leave her alone!

378
00:21:23,622 --> 00:21:26,290
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Anna! Leave her one! Anna!

379
00:21:52,382 --> 00:21:53,783
The device is done.

380
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:56,019
The only thing keeping them down
is the vervain.

381
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,321
We don't have much time.
Let's finish this.

382
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:06,829
Anna.

383
00:22:08,164 --> 00:22:11,200
[liquid sloshing]

384
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:13,367
You can head up.
I'll take it from here.

385
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:18,973
[grunting]

386
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,215
Please.
Uhh.

387
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,684
Uhh.

388
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,520
[gasps]

389
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,126
Are you ok?
It's like needles

390
00:23:19,193 --> 00:23:21,193
Were piercing my skull,
and then it just stopped.

391
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:23,129
I saw at least
5 vampires go down.

392
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,430
They were taking them to
your family's old building.

393
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:29,635
It's the gilbert device.
It has to be.

394
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:31,771
But how did he
get it to work?

395
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:33,538
Bonnie unspelled it.

396
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:35,174
Maybe she didn't.

397
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:37,041
She did.
We saw her do it.

398
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:39,443
No, no, no. He's right.
Think about it.

399
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:42,446
We asked bonnie
to deactivate a device

400
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:44,783
That could protect people
against vampires.

401
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,651
So we could
protect you.

402
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,788
And damon. Vampires.

403
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:51,823
Where is damon?

404
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:55,325
I don't know.
I haven't seen him
since this started.

405
00:23:56,761 --> 00:23:58,896
Can you get my broer?
Take him home?

406
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:01,198
Of course.
Let's go.

407
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,433
[door opens]

408
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:06,136
Liz. Are you ok?

409
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:07,771
There's a key in--
what is going on?

410
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,672
There's a key in my belt.
I need you to get it.

411
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,874
Uhh. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

412
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:13,742
Something's happened
to richard.

413
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:15,744
They took him.
Who took him?

414
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:18,314
Your deputies.
I--I don't understand.

415
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:20,449
He's not a vampire.

416
00:24:20,517 --> 00:24:22,084
Let's go.

417
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:26,054
[grunting and groaning]

418
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,425
Mayor.

419
00:24:31,627 --> 00:24:33,995
Ishat you?
What are you doing here?!

420
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:36,264
I'm a vampire.

421
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,467
What's your excuse?

422
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:42,669
No, really.

423
00:24:42,737 --> 00:24:45,272
The vervain
didn't affect you.

424
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,543
You're not a vampire.
What the hell are you?

425
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:53,113
Mayor lockwood.

426
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:54,748

[panting]

428
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:58,818
Hey, are you ok?
Your side took
the biggest hit.

429
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:00,453
I'm fine. I'm fine.
No, they need

430
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,655
To check you out.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

431
00:25:02,723 --> 00:25:04,557
They're helping tyler.

432
00:25:04,624 --> 00:25:07,793
Pulse is steadying.
All right.

00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:11,564
[pants]

434
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,236
What the hell?
What? What's wrong?

435
00:25:17,303 --> 00:25:18,803
His eyes.

436
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:25,143
[inhales and pants]

437
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:29,847
What happened?
Dude, don't scare me like that.

438
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:32,116
Woman: Hey, she needs
some help over here.

439
00:25:32,184 --> 00:25:33,751
Caroline!

440
00:25:33,818 --> 00:25:35,253
Guys! Unh!

441
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,588
Caroline, hey.
God, what happened?

442
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:39,924
Caroline, wake up.

443
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:43,261
Wait, wait, wait.

444
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:45,128
I can hear them.

445
00:25:45,196 --> 00:25:46,863
The building's
on fire.

446
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:48,932
Elena: What?
Building's on fire.

447
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:53,770
[clattering]

448
00:25:58,209 --> 00:25:59,742
Where's damon?

449
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,810
With the rest of them,

450
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:05,281
Where he should be.
It's over for damon.

451
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,184
You're crazy.
Why?

452
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:12,454
'cause I'm doing what
shou have been done
145 years ago?

453
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:14,856
This is
the right thing, elena.

454
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:20,395
Go ahead.
You won't make it out.

455
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:22,997
It'll save me the trouble
of killing you myself.

456
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:25,266
You know
the building well.

457
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,568
Is therenother
entrance in?

458
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:30,838
Utility door. There's one
around the side.

459

[grunts]

460
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,374
Take one more step,
and I'll alert those deputies

461
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:37,911
That they missed a vampire.
I'm asking you not to.

462
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:40,680
That doesn't mean
anything to me.

463
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:44,517
As my father, it should.

464
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:53,092
You know.

465
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,627
I wasn't sure.

466
00:26:55,695 --> 00:26:57,529
But now I am.

467
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:07,072
Boie: Hey!
You can't go in there.

468
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,040
The fire
will take you out.

469
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:12,243
He's my brother, bonnie.

470
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:20,251

00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:55,690
The fire's out.

490
00:28:55,757 --> 00:28:59,660
The story is that
the building's old wiring
is what caused it.

491
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:03,130
Did you see
where damon nt?

492
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:06,100
No, he just
kind of disappeared.

493
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:08,502
Figures. [chuckles]

494
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:10,970
Ohh.

[exhales]

497
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:19,646
I try so hard...

498
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:22,315
To hate him.

499
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:25,917
I guess it's just
pointless.

500
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:28,621
You care about him.

501
00:29:30,657 --> 00:29:32,391
So do I.

502
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:37,763
But I love you, stefan.

503
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,066
I know that you're worried
about that.

504
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:45,470
I just...
You know,

505
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,372
I-I know my brother.

506
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:48,906
But I love you, stefan.

507
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:51,743
I know the trouble
he can cause.

508
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:55,480
I love you, stefan. You.

509
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:09,359
You have nothing
to worry about.

510
00:30:10,495 --> 00:30:13,929
Ok?

511
00:30:13,997 --> 00:30:16,899
[exhales] so jenna called.

512
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:19,335
Jeremy's home.

513
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:20,936
I'm just gonna run over
to the school

514
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:22,905
To pick up my dress,
my clothes
the rest of my stuff.

515
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:25,207
And en I'll check on him.

516
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:50,030
What are you doing here?

517
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:52,499
Anna's dead.

518
00:30:53,968 --> 00:30:58,138
I figured that
once they took her away.

519
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,941
I know you cared
about her.

520
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:04,910
Yeah, I did.

521
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:07,347
I saw her killed.

522
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:13,753
I was watching
and all I could
think about was...

523
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:16,689
I wanted to help her.

524
00:31:16,757 --> 00:31:19,190
But I couldn't.

525
00:31:19,258 --> 00:31:22,494
Why are you telling me
all this?

526
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:26,598
I took away
your sfering
once before.

527
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:29,401
I can do it again.

528
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:31,436
But it's your choice.

529
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:33,471
Look...

530
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:36,907
I know you think
you took it away,

531
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:40,143
But it's still there.

532
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:42,713
Even if I can't
remember why,

533
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:45,249
I still feel empty.

534
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:47,217
Alone.

535
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:53,423
And making me forget
won't fix it.

536
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:56,526
It won't fix
what's really wrong.

537
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:06,301
What I did to vicki

538
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:09,037
Was wrong.

539
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:12,674
Sorry for my part.

540
00:32:18,314 --> 00:32:21,516
Anna said that vampires
don't have to feel pain;

541
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:25,219
That they could turn it off
if they shut out their humanity.

542
00:32:26,688 --> 00:32:29,323
That's very true.

543
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:31,426
Is it easier that way?

544
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,361
Is what easier?

545
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,831
[scoffs] life.

546
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:40,133
Life sucks
either way, jeremy.

547
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:43,437
At least
if you're a vampire,

548
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,639
You don't have
to feel bad abouit
if you don't want to.

549
00:32:45,706 --> 00:32:47,674
Is that what you did?

550
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:49,609
I did it for...

551
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:53,012
I did it for
a very long time.

552
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:58,517
And life was
a lot easier.

553
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:07,493
[crickets chirping]

554
00:33:09,628 --> 00:33:11,529
Hey, man.

555
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,032
I'm so sorry.

556
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,435
Look, I don't even know
what happened.

557
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:20,472
It's ok, man.

558
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,040
L right.

559
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:35,586
What's happening?
Is she all right?

560
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:37,988
Oh, there was some
internal bleeding.

561
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:39,189
We're taking her
into surry.

562
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:40,757
What else did they say?

563
00:33:40,825 --> 00:33:41,791
Is she going to be ok?

564
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:44,927
They're going to do
everything they can.

565
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:52,768
Tyler, have you
talked to your mom?

566
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:56,238
I left her message
telling her I was here.

567
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,139
You need to call her.

568
00:33:58,207 --> 00:33:59,941
What is it?

569
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:03,745
It's your dad.

570
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,684
[exhales]

571
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:05,170
[indistinct chatter]
oh, hey.

572
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:06,704
Hey.
You, uh,

573
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,106
You just missed
elena.

574
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:09,774
I was looking for you,
actually.

575
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:11,609
Oh.

576
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:14,411
Elena is my best frien

577
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:16,646
And because she loves you,

578
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,349
I couldn't let you
or damon die in that fire.

579
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,750
I'm very grateful,
bonnie.

580
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,119
I hope you know that.

581
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:25,455
I do. But I hope you know
that tngs have to change.

582
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,491
Damon has to change.

583
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:31,795
We both want
the same thing.

584
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:35,198
We both want to protect
the people we care about.

585
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:37,066
The difference is,
for you,

586
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:38,601
Damon is one of them.

587
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,604
You saw what I was able
to do tonight.

588
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:44,040
I know who I am now.

589
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:48,044
And if damon spills
so much as one drop

590
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:53,115
Of innocent blood,
I'll take him down.

591
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:59,155
Even if have
to take you with him.

592
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:05,060
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that.

593
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:07,829
Let's hope it doesn't.

594
00:36:21,176 --> 00:36:23,677
Whatre you doing here?

595
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:30,517
A failed and feeble attempt
at doing the right thing.

596
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:33,320
Which was...

597
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:38,458
It's not important.
I'll take this from you.

598
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:47,634
Thank you.

599
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:49,168
You know,
I came in this town

600
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,770
Wanting to destroy it.

601
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:52,037
Tonight I...

602
00:36:52,105 --> 00:36:56,074
Found myself wanting
to protect it.

603
00:36:57,911 --> 00:37:00,946
How does that happen?

604
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:03,682
I'm not a hero, elena.

605
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,817
I don'do good.

606
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:06,684
It's not in me.

607
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:09,621
Maybe it is.

608
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,089
No.

609
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:13,825
No, it's reserved
for my brother
and--and you,

610
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:15,860
Andonnie,

611
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,796
Even though
she has every
reason to te me,

612
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:22,166
Still helped
stefan save me.

613
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:24,501
Why do you sou
so surprised?

614
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:25,803
Because she did it
for you.

615
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:29,173
Which means
that somewhere
along the way,

616
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:33,677
You decided that
I was worth saving.

617
00:37:33,745 --> 00:37:35,413
And I wanted to...

618
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,381
Thank you for that.

619
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:43,219
You're welcome.

[music playing]

621
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,031
Hi.

622
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:32,299
It's late.

623
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:34,634
You should probably
come inside.

624
00:38:37,171 --> 00:38:39,339
[elena sighs]

625
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:50,082
What are you doing?

626
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,186
I don't want
to talk about it.

627
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:36,825
[chuckles] you scared me.

628
00:39:36,893 --> 00:39:39,495
Sorry.

629
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:43,632
Ohh.

630
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,369
You know, I first
met isobel when
I was a teenager.

631
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:49,004
I fell in love
with her instantly,

632
00:39:49,072 --> 00:39:50,639
Although I'm pretty sure

633
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:52,808
She never loved me.

634
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:54,643
She was special.

635
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:56,845
And part of why I hate
the vampir so much

636
00:39:56,913 --> 00:39:58,346
Is because
what she became.

637
00:39:58,414 --> 00:40:02,650
How it ruined her.

638
00:40:02,718 --> 00:40:04,185
And I never would have
sent her to damo

639
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:06,821
Had I known
she wanted to turn.

640
00:40:10,025 --> 00:40:12,359
It's my fault.

641
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:14,929
I'm telling you this

642
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:17,164
Because I hoped

643
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:19,299
Maybe you'd
understand.

644
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,805
Thank you.

645
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:28,241
Can I help?

00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:33,379
