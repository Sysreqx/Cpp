00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:02,667
Previously
on "the vampire diaries"...

2
00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:05,400
Stefan: for over
a century, I have lived
in secret until now.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,834
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

4
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,734
What are you?

5
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:11,067
I'm a vampire.

6
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:12,334
You said you don't
kill to survive.

7
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:13,367
Animal blood
keeps me alive,

8
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:14,501
But not as strong
as damon.

9
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:16,834
Hello, brother.
damon.

10
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,100
Stefan finally fessed up.

11
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,901
Stay away from me.

12
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:22,133
That necklace contains
an herb called vervain.

13
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:24,501
It protects you
from being compelled.

14
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:25,467
I will keep
your secret,

15
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:27,634
But I can't be
with you, stefan.

16
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,467
What is that?

17
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:30,634
It's a very important crystal.

18
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:32,434
Are you psychic
or clairvoyant?

19
00:00:32,434 --> 00:00:34,133
Technically,
grams says I'm a witch.

20
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:38,434
There was a time when
this town was very much
aware of vampires.

21
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:39,701
5 bodies
all drained of blood.

22
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,100
They've come back.

23
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,901
Aah!

24
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,934
You just don't
wanna die, do you?

25
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,367
Stefan:
she's transitioning.

26
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:47,734
Into what?
a vampire.

27
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:48,834
I don't know
what's wrong with her.

28
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,501
She'll be fine.
vicki: no.

29
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:51,767
We'll all be fine.

30
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:52,968
Vicki!

31
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:54,367
I will make sure that
she does not hurt anybody,

32
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:55,567
Elena, I promise you.

33
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:06,834
[clunk]

34
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:33,434
Hi, ty.

35
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:34,434
Whoa!

36
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:35,934
Vicki?

37
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:39,334
Everyone's
looking for you.

38
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:40,334
I know.

39
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,634
What's wrong, vic?

40
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,067
I'm so cold.

41
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,133
Are you on drugs?

42
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,434
Everyone thinks
you're off on a bender.

43
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:46,701
I wish.

44
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,501
What happened
in those woods, vicki?

45
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:49,868
Those kids
that were killed,

46
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,501
What did you see?

47
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,033
I'm so scared.

48
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,834
Come here.

49
00:01:58,834 --> 00:01:59,868
It's ok.

50
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:01,934
I'll take you home.

51
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,734
I can't control it.

52
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:04,701
Control what?

53
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,968
I am so hungry, ty.

54
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,934
And it won't go away.

55
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:13,133
What are you on?
what drugs did you take?

56
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:17,968
I want it.
I'm so hungry, ty.

57
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:20,767
Ok, look, I'll get you
something to eat.
just sit back.

58
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,033
Look, let's just
get you home. vicki!

59
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,467
Ok, what is
wrong with you?

60
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,434
Aah! let go of me!

61
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:38,033
What's going on
here, stefan?
what's wrong with her?

62
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,033
You don't talk.

63
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,334
Screw you, dude.

64
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:42,167
"dude"? really?
"dude"?

65
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,300
Damon, don't.

66
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,667
Oh, come on.
who's gonna miss
this idiot?

67
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,434
Ohh! don't you hurt him.

68
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,667
Forget what you
saw here tonight.

69
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:53,901
None of us
were here.

71
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:43,903
Sorry.
Oh, no, it's cool, I'm done.

72
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:47,504
You're up early.
Where are you going?

73
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:48,834
Police station.
they're organizing

74
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,567
The search party
for vicki, so...

75
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,867
Wait. shouldn't you
be going to school?

76
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,700
What? you're kidding me, right?

77
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,034
You shouldn't
skip school.

78
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:58,034
If they find her,
we'll know.

79
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,168
That's what
cellphones are for.

80
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:00,169
Yeah, your lips keep movin'.
I don't know why.

81
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,968
[cellphone rings]

82
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:19,868
Yeah?

83
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:20,901
Matty?

84
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:23,267
Vicki, where are you?
are you ok?

85
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:24,400
Yeah. I'm ok.

86
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,501
Tell me where you are,
and I'll come get you.

87
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,901
No. matty, I just need some time
to figure things out.

88
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:32,634
Just know that I'm ok,
ok?

89
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:33,801
Please don't
worry about me.

00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:34,767
[beep]

91
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:42,367
I don't understand why I have
to stay cooped up here.

92
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,467
Why can't
I just go home?

93
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,634
Because you're changing,
vicki,

94
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,167
And it's not something
you wanna do alone.

95
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:50,534
There's nothin' about
that logan guy I killed in here,

96
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:52,868
Not a word.

97
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:54,467
Someone's
covering it up.

98
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,634
What is that?

99
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:57,734
This is a very special,
very old compass.

100
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,334
What was logan fell doing with it?
aren't you curious?

101
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,567
Well, if you're so worried
that somebody's onto you,

102
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,300
Why don't you
just leave town, damon?

103
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,534
We should all
be worried.

104
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:09,200
Hey, um, I'm hungry.
do you have anything to eat?

105
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:13,734
Here.

106
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:16,801
What is it?

107
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:17,901
It's what you're craving.

108
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,968
Heh. don't lie
to the girl.

109
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,467
It's so not
what you're craving,

110
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:23,467
But it'll do
in a pinch, right, stef?

111
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:24,567
What is it?

112
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,133
Yeah, what is it?
is it skunk?

113
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,968
Saint bernard? bambi?

114
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:29,367
Go on.
give it a try.

115
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,033
She's new.
she needs people blood.

116
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,067
she can't sustain
on that stuff.

117
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,634
Yeah, why can't I
have people blood?
yeah.

118
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,801
Because it's wrong
to pray on innocent
people, vicki.

119
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:39,601
You don't have to kill
to feed.

120
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:40,934
Just find someone
really tasty

121
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:43,234
And then erase
their memory afterwards.
it's so easy.

122
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:45,133
No, no, no.
there's no guarantee

123
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,501
That you can
control yourself, ok?

124
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:47,901
It takes years
to learn that.

125
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,400
You could easily
kill somebody,

126
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
And then you have to
carry that with you for
the rest of your life,

127
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Which, if I haven't made clear,
is eternity.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,100
Don't listen to him.

129
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,834
He walks on a moral plane
way out of our eye line.

130
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,767
I say snatch, eat, erase.

131
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:02,968
Hey, look at me.

132
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:05,033
We choose
our own path.

133
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:08,601
Our values and our actions,
they define who we are.

134
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,968
Ok, count deepak.

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,667
I am outta here.

136
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,033
Can I have
some more?

137
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,801
[bell rings]

138
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,901
Is stefan here?

139
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,033
Yep.

140
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,734
Where is he?

141
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:45,734
And good morning
to you, little miss
"I'm on a mission."

142
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:48,601
How can you be
so arrogant and glib

143
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,334
After everything
that you've done?

144
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:53,133
And how can you be
so brave and stupid

145
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,300
To call a vampire
arrogant and glib?

146
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,968
If you wanted me dead,
I'd be dead.

147
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:58,067
Yes, you would.

148
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:00,167
But I'm not.
yet.

149
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,968
Where is stefan?

150
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:03,968
He's upstairs

151
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:06,100
Singing
"the rain in spain."

152
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,167
Knock yourself out.

153
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:22,133
Stefan.

154
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,667
[creak]

155
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:25,767
Stefan?

156
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:26,901
Yes.

157
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,501
Where is vicki?

158
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,567
She's upstairs.

159
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,634
What happens now?

160
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:40,367
Because my brother is
out there searching for her
with the rest of the town.

161
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,734
What do I tell him?

162
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:43,901
I'm working
with her, but it's
gonna take time.

163
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,767
She's a very volatile
and impulsive
personality.

164
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,200
She's a drug user.
I mean, all that's

165
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Gonna play a part
in how she responds
to this.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,300
So she's a vampire
with issues?

167
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,133
what am I supposed to do?

168
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:58,000
Because I am lying
to everyone that I care about.
what's gonna happen to her?

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,267
I'm gonna keep her
here with me until
I know that she's safe.

170
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,300
Vicki: how long is that?

171
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,567
We can talk
about that later.

172
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:11,501
Hey, vicki, how are you?

173
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,267
How am I?

174
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,400
You're kidding, right?

175
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:24,000
Was our family burned
in the witch trials?

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,934
No, the girls that
were persecuted in salem
were entirely innocent.

177
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:32,968
You have to have
more than ignorance
to trap a real witch.

178
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:35,634
How did we end up
in mystic falls?

179
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:40,400
Our family
fled salem in 1692
and relocated here.

180
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,834
our ancestors lived
in secrecy for over
a hundred years.

181
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,834
It's important
that we still do.

182
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:49,167
Well, grams, everybody
knows you're a witch.

183
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,234
They also know
it's absurd,

184
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:52,901
Can't be true.

185
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,567
I'm just
a kooky lady

186
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,734
That teaches occult
at the university.

187
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,133
No one
really believes.

188
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:00,901
They just poke fun.

189
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,334
And let 'em.

190
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,300
Just don't let 'em
know the truth.

191
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,701
[sighs]

192
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,467
Where's the witchcraft?

193
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:10,467
I mean, you've been
talking history for 2 days.

194
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,801
I wanna get
to the fun part.

195
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,901
It's not meant
to be fun.

196
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,868
it's real,
and it's serious,

197
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:19,801
And you must
understand it before
you practice it.

198
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:24,901
Aren't you
late for school?

199
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,601
We never should have
trusted that logan...

200
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,133
Weasel with the watch.

201
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,467
How many are
we dealing with?

202
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:51,701
Well, the coroner
thinks one.

203
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:53,467
Somethinabout
the wound radius
and the jaw pattern.

204
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,467
Are we in danger?

205
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:56,033
I mean, if it
found the watch,

206
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,400
Then it knows we know,
and could it come after us?

207
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,934
A-and should I even
be saying, "it"?

208
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,934
Or--or is it
a he or a she?

209
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,701
If it has any historical
knowledge of the town,

210
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,300
Then it'll know where
the watch came from,

211
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,434
So, yes, we could
very much be in danger.

212
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:08,834
So what do we do?

213
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,934
Just keep it quiet.
we can't have

214
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:12,734
The entire town
aware of this.

215
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:15,434
We need to find him
before he finds us.

216
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:17,400
[music playing]

217
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,601
Hey, man.

218
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey.

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,501
I heard they're putting together
a search party for vicki.

220
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,400
She just called.
she's ok.

221
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,067
Oh, good.

222
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:34,567
That's great. I figured
you must have been goin'
out of your mind.

223
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,033
Little bit, yeah.

224
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:37,601
I was just gonna offer,

225
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,534
You know, if there's
anything I could do.

226
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,901
I appreciate it.

227
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:44,067
I have got your costume.

228
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,033
It's all here.

229
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,167
Seriously?

230
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,601
Come on.

231
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:53,501
Can someone please be excited
that it's halloween?

232
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,801
I just wanna have fun,
you know,

233
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:59,701
Just some silly,
fluffy, damon-free fun.

234
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,767
Hey, isn't this the one
you got from damon?

235
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:04,234
Yep. wear it.
toss it. I don't care.

236
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:06,133
I just want it gone.

237
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,267
Hey, have you seen elena?

238
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,667
Do we know
what she's wearing?

239
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,234
I was with grams
all weekend.

240
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,567
I haven't
talked to her.

241
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,033
Maybe she's
with stefan.

242
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,701
Riding to his castle
on his white horse.

243
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,534
Don't be bitter.
it provokes wrinkles.

244
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:18,667
[scoffs]

245
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:23,234
Coffee is our friend.
it's the caffeine.

246
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:24,634
It circulates
through our veins,

247
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:28,868
And it warms our body
so we're not so cold
to the touch.

248
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:31,100
Well, what if I wanna
drink human blood?

249
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,767
You're gonna have
to learn to live
with that urge

250
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:36,901
And fight it
on a daily basis
one day at a time.

251
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:38,667
Oh, god, don't start
with that whole 12 steps thing.

252
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,801
School counselor
has been down that road,

253
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,367
And it doesn't
work for me.

254
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,400
It can work.
it's your choice, vicki.

255
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,367
So you've never
tasted human blood?

256
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:53,200
Not in a long time.

257
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
How long?

258
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,501
Years and years.

259
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,567
I'm not proud
of my past behavior.

260
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:03,534
[sighs] does this
sketchy feeling ever go away?

261
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:05,434
It's like I have
a massive hangover.

262
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,167
This daylight thing
is a bitch.

263
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:09,234
[sighs] I need more blood.

264
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:10,834
Where's your bathroom?
I have to pee.

265
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:13,367
Why do I have to pee?
I thought I was dead.

266
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,467
I'm going to, uh--

267
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,467
I'm gonna get her
some more.

268
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:23,501
All right.

269
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:25,234
I'll be quick.

270
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,868
[sighs] false alarm.

271
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:41,801
My body's feeling
really funky.

272
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:44,467
It's a good funk,
but it's weird.

273
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:45,601
Hmm.

274
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:47,267
Who are you calling?

275
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,968
Jeremy.

276
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,701
Vicki, you can't
see jeremy anymore.

277
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:52,901
Oh, come on.
don't you start.

278
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,434
I'm gonna see
whoever I wanna see.

279
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:55,801
Even though
you could hurt him?

280
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:56,968
I would never
hurt jeremy.

281
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,434
I know you think that,

282
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:00,234
But I can't
take that risk.

283
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:02,534
You're gonna have
to let jeremy go now.

284
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:03,734
Ohohreally?

285
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:05,968
And how long
have you been preparing

286
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:07,467
A "you're not
good enough" speech?

287
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,467
I'm presuming it predates
the whole vampire thing.

288
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:14,167
All I'm saying is jeremy
is not getting involved
in any of this.

289
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,334
I mean it, vicki.

290
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:17,434
Or what?

291
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,734
Let's get one thing straight,
you perky little bitch.

292
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:26,400
You had my brother whipped
for 15 years,

293
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,734
15 years,
and then you dumped him.

294
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:33,400
When I look at you,
that is all I see,
just so you know.

295
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,634
And I'm gonna see jeremy
whenever I wanna see jeremy,

296
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,968
Because I have
some fun new toys to play with,

297
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:42,667
And I won't think twice about
ripping your little head off.

298
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,167
You got it?

299
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,734
[coughs]

300
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:55,968
She threatened me.

301
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,567
She's on edge.

302
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,901
Imagine every sense
in your body operating
at super speed.

303
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:01,767
I mean, she's uncomfortable
in her own skin,

304
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,834
And then when you
throw in her other issues--

305
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,467
How long
before it settles?

306
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:06,968
Hours? days? weeks?

307
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:08,300
There's no rule book.

308
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,033
Well, how long
before you learned
to control it?

309
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,634
A while,

310
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:12,834
But I didn't have
anybody helping me.

311
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:14,167
I had to do it
on my own.

312
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,167
The thing is it's hard
to resist certain people,

313
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,467
Especially when you're new.

314
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:20,501
it's difficult
to separate your feelings.

315
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:25,834
Love, lust, anger, desire--
it can all blur into
one urge, hunger.

316
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,367
What does that mean?

317
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,834
It means that jeremy
can't see her,

318
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,834
Not now. she might not
be able to resist him,

319
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:32,267
And she could hurt him.

320
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:34,334
Or worse.

321
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:36,667
I'm not gonna
let anybody get hurt.

322
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:39,834
I need to get going.

323
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:40,868
Elena--

324
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:42,000
Please, stefan.

325
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,934
There's only
so much I can take.

326
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,734
[music playing]

327
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,868
What are you doing?

328
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:59,267
Just contemplating
the next hundred years.

329
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:08,367
Why did you do it?

330
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,701
I was...

331
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,667
Bored.

332
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:17,200
You did this to me
out of boredom?

333
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,534
It's one of
the pitfalls
of eternity.

334
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:24,534
Now I'm bored.

335
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:25,968
And all I can
think about is blood.

336
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:26,968
I just want some blood.

337
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,033
I can't think
about anything else.

338
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,033
What is that about?

339
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:30,767
That'll ease up.

340
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:33,200
You've just been
cooped up all day.

341
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,334
Let's go.

342
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,167
Where?

343
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,200
Your life was pathetic.

344
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,734
Your afterlife
doesn't have to be.

345
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,684
What are you doing?

346
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:49,283
She's been cooped up
in your room all day.

347
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,450
She's not anne frank.

348
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,484
No, no, no.
hey, hey...

349
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,751
Now's not the time
for this.

350
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,218
If you're gonna
teach her, teach her.

351
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,517
Show her
what it's all about.

352

She needs to get better.

The best thing you can do
for her is let her go.

mean, "let her go"?

I get these moments,

started to feel just
a little bit better,

single one of 'em.

00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:29,134
Hmm.

530
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:31,600
But I am so late.

531
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,300
My husband is not going
to be happy with me.

532
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,834
well, are you happy
with your husband?

533
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:42,268
You're flirting with me.

534
00:25:42,268 --> 00:25:43,600
you flirted
with me first.

535
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,467
True. [laughs]

536
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:47,834
Let me escort you
to the school.

537
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,168
It's not safe
out there alone.

538
00:25:50,168 --> 00:25:52,367
I mean, I've seen
10 vampires tonight.

539
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:55,901
Heh. well, if only
the real ones were
as easy to find.

540
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:56,901
How's that search goin'?

541
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:59,001
Oh, we had the founder's party,

542
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:01,333
And anyone who arrived
during the day

543
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,268
Was eliminated
as a suspect.

544
00:26:04,268 --> 00:26:05,400
Oh.

545
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,767
And all the rest were
just dead ends, so mmm.

546
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,433
Mmm.
mmm, I gotta go.

547
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:11,400
Ok.

548
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,133
Thank god.

549
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,133
What's the matter?

550
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,801
I lost track
of jeremy.
I was worried.

551
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,267
What's goin' on?

552
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:25,868
Hey. uh, everything's fine.

553
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:28,033
I told you
to quit bothering me.

554
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,567
No. vicki,
don't do this.

555
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:31,000
Matt, he won't
leave me alone.

556
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,501
You need
to back off, man.

557
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:33,567
Matt, it's--
it's ok.

558
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:34,567
No, it's not ok.

559
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:36,033
What the hell is
your problem?

560
00:26:37,968 --> 00:26:39,200
Stefan.

561
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,167
I'm trying
to help her.

562
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:56,567
[recorded scream]

563
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,334
[creature roars]

564
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:02,300
Whoa!

565
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:06,033
Vic, you scared
the hell out of me.

566
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:07,000
Sorry. I'm sorry.

567
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:11,000
Come on. come on.

568
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,968
Ok.

569
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,250
So where--where'd
caroline run off to?

570
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,684
Do yourself a favor, damon,
and don't ask me about caroline.

571
00:27:28,684 --> 00:27:29,684
Oh, bonnie.

572
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:31,484
So loyal.

573
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,684
Just stay away from her.

574
00:27:35,317 --> 00:27:37,017
Where'd you get that?

575
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:39,017
From a friend.

576
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:40,017
Caroline.

577
00:27:40,017 --> 00:27:42,117
You know that's mine,
don't you?

578
00:27:42,117 --> 00:27:43,117
Not anymore.

579
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:44,684
Funny.

580
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:46,351
I'd like it back,
please.

581
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:47,950
I'm not giving it to you.

582
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,983
I'll give it to caroline,
and she can give it to you

583
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:50,983
If she feels like it.

584
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:53,017
Or I could just
take it right now.

585
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:55,017
[sizzles]

586
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,417

[recorded scream]

590
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:39,084
Jeremy.

591
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:45,517
I was so worried
about you.

592
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,684
I'm fine now, but...

593
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,150
I gotta leave.

594
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,351
Wh-what?

595
00:28:50,351 --> 00:28:52,250
Where?

596
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,217
I gotta get
out of here, j.

597
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:56,551
I just--I can't live
at home with matt.

598
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:58,017
He just doesn't get it.

599
00:28:58,017 --> 00:29:00,084
No, you can't.
you can't just leave.

600
00:29:01,818 --> 00:29:03,084
Come with me.

601
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,484
If you come
with me, we can be
together forever.

602
00:29:15,617 --> 00:29:16,617
Ok.

603
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:18,117
Yeah.

604
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,351
Ow.

605
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:38,351
You're taking that costume
a little too far.

606
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,784
What? what is it?

607
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,050
Vicki! vicki,
what the hell?!

608
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:07,384
Oh, my god.

609
00:30:08,617 --> 00:30:10,651
No! stop! vicki!

610
00:30:10,651 --> 00:30:12,718
no! aah!

611
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,317
Vicki, no!

612
00:30:30,983 --> 00:30:32,551
Jeremy: vicki!

613
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:41,718
Go. get inside.

614
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:42,751
Go!

615
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:51,050
Aah!

616
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:56,751
[screaming]

617
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:19,384

621
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,484
Vicki!

622
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:35,950
Vicki!

623
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:45,184
Get him out of here.

624
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:49,184
[beep]

625
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,351
What?

626
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,351
Need your help.

627
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,751
[lock turning]

628
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:15,950
[panting]

629
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,317
What happened to you?

630
00:32:17,317 --> 00:32:19,317
I did something.
I don't know.

631
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:20,818
It came from my necklace.

632
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:23,317
Where'd you get that?

633
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:24,983
It's part of my costume.

634
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:26,651
it's a piece of junk.

635
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:28,983
That piece of junk
belonged to one

636
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:31,617
Of the most powerful
witches of our family.

637
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:33,618
Let me show you.

638
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:41,619
There she is.

639
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,484
Emily bennett,

640
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:47,551
Your great-great-
great-great-grandmother.

641
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,552
And there's your necklace.

642
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:55,751
[elena crying]

643
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:02,751
You should go.

644
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:04,284
I got this.

645
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:08,350
You did this.

646
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,217
This is your fault.

647
00:33:10,217 --> 00:33:12,050
You confuse me
for someone with remorse.

648
00:33:18,183 --> 00:33:20,884
None of this
matters to me,

649
00:33:20,884 --> 00:33:22,018
None of it.

650
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:24,918
People die around you.

651
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:26,417
How could it not matter?

652
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:29,050
It matters,
and you know it.

653
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,551
Mmm.

654
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:45,584
You need to leave.

655
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:51,050
Your wounds are bleeding,
and you need to leave.

656
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:05,784
[sighs]

657
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:17,884
Elena!
hey, have you seen--

658
00:34:17,884 --> 00:34:19,450
Whoa. wh-what happened?

659
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,450
Nothing. some idiot
with some fake blood got me.

660
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,384
I'm gonna go home
and shower.

661
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,851
I--I can't find vicki.

662
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,450
She totally
bailed on me.

663
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,217
I don't know where she is.

664
00:34:35,317 --> 00:34:37,317
Is this
what I'm in for,

665
00:34:37,317 --> 00:34:39,284
A lifetime of
worrying about her?

666
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,150
You're a good brother, matt.

667
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:49,317
Maybe she went home.

668
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,050
Maybe.

669
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:34,417
Where is he?

670
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:37,117
Inside.

671
00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:02,484
Do you understand
what happened tonight?

672
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:04,150
No.

673
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:07,151
I don't understand.

674
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:10,317
I mean, I know
what I saw, but...

675
00:36:10,317 --> 00:36:12,050
I don't understand.

676
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,750
She was going
to kilme..

677
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,284
Now she's dead.
vicki's dead.

678
00:36:19,451 --> 00:36:22,084
I'm so sorry, jer.

679
00:36:22,084 --> 00:36:24,251
Make it stop.
it hurts.

680
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:27,117
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
it's ok. it's ok.

681
00:36:27,117 --> 00:36:30,117
Why does everybody
have to die on me?

682
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,650
Oh, my god. come here.

683
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:40,750
[music playing]

684
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:32,084
Are you ok?

685
00:37:38,451 --> 00:37:40,484
I, uh--I wanted to help her.

686
00:37:44,217 --> 00:37:46,518
But instead, uh...

687
00:37:51,817 --> 00:37:53,251
How's he doin'?

688
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:55,351
He's a mess.

689
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:58,050
I don't want him going
through this again.

690
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,351
He's just a kid.

691
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,817
Elena, what can I do? I--

692
00:38:01,817 --> 00:38:04,384
What can I do to help?
I'll do anything.

693
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:07,184
Can you make him forget?

694
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:09,284
Elena...

695
00:38:09,284 --> 00:38:11,317
Stefan, please.

696
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:14,417
I don't know how he'll
ever get past this.

697
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,417
I just want him
to forget everything
that happened.

698
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:21,084
If I did it, there's no
guarantee that it would work--

699
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:24,518
Because of who I am,
because of how I live.

700
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:27,518
I don't have the ability
to do it right.

701
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:29,217
Damon: I can do it.

702
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:34,251
If this is
what you want...

703
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:40,050
I'll do it.

704
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,151
It's what I want.

705
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,584
What do you
want him to know?

706
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:04,750
I want you to tell him
that vicki left town

707
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,950
And she's not coming back,

708
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:12,384
That he shouldn't
look for her or
worry about her.

709
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:16,017
He's gonna miss her, but he
knows it's for the best.

710
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:39,184
Part of me wishes that
I could forget, too...

711
00:39:40,717 --> 00:39:42,917
Forget meeting you,

712
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:46,518
Finding out what
you are and everything
that's happened since.

713
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:50,650
If that's what you want.

714
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:55,017
Yes, it is.

715
00:39:58,351 --> 00:40:01,884
Because I don't
want it to be like this.

716
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:06,184
I don't wanna
feel like this.

717
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:12,850
But I can't.

718
00:40:14,284 --> 00:40:17,683
With everything
that's happened...

719
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:21,050
I can't lose the way
I feel about you.

720
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:35,750
It's done.
