Yes, he would.

not to go.

i'm being selfish.

00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:41,034
We need to talk.

180
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:45,001
So what's up
with you and forbes?

181
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:46,400
Nothin's up.

182
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,567
I saw you two
in the hall today.

183
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,634
Don't even try
and deny it, bro.

184
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:50,801
You're tappin' that.

185
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,268
No, it's not like that.

186
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:54,234
Never is
till you become "we people."

187
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,234
[music playing]

188
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:58,134
"we people"?

189
00:08:58,134 --> 00:08:59,134
Yeah.

190
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:00,901
"we can't make it
to the party."

191
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,300
"we'll never
miss a game."

192
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,101
"we don't like
the color red."

193
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:06,367
We hung out,
like, twice.

194
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:08,967
Like i said, "we."

195
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:13,001
So you have no idea
who it could be?

196
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,001
None.

197
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:15,901
But it must be
somebody new,

198
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,801
Because leaving
a body like that,

199
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:18,834
They're
either sloppy,

200
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,134
Or they're trying
to send a message.

201
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:22,201
And u're sure
it's not damon.

202
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:23,867
Well, i'm never
sure about damon,

203
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,634
But he's been
trying to keep
a low profile lately,

204
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:29,168
So it just doesn't
make any sense to me.

205
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,734
So what are you
gonna do?

206
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:33,867
Damon's tracking them
right now.

207
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:39,333
Look, i promised you
the truth,

208
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,500
So i wanted to tell you.

209
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,300
I want you
to be careful.

210
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,634
When i saw you, i...

211
00:09:49,634 --> 00:09:51,967
Thought you were coming
to say good-bye.

212
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,433
Ah.

213
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,700
Not yet.

214
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,400
[footsteps]

215
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,101
Hey, what do
you think?

216
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:07,168
Creepy.

217
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:09,500
Found this old journal
in dad's stuff--

218
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,801
Jonathan gilbert
from the 1800s.

219
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,667
He's kind of
a freak show.
he wrote about demons

220
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,734
And all these people
getting slaughtered
and--

221
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:19,101
Yeah, he was a writer--
short stories, horror stuff.

222
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:20,534
Oh, he wrote fiction?

223
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:23,534
Figured he was just
a lunatic or a drunk.

224
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,367
Well, he was a gilbert,

225
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:28,834
Probably
a little bit of both.

226
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,268
So what do i do now?

227
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,767
Damon: just wait.
i'll be there in a minute.

228
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,967
Can you hurry?
i have things to do.

229
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,001
You could
give me that.

230
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,767
So why did you
need me to do this?

231
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:48,367
Because i interfere
with the signal.

232
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:49,700
Can i go now?

233
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,534
This has blown,
like, half of my day.

234
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:55,234
You do that.

235
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,700
Get in your car.
go home.

236
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,067
Forget i asked you
to do this.

237
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,834
Ok. bye now.

238
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:02,834
Bye.

239
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,201
[gunfire]

240
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:37,767
[groaning]

241
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:47,800
I have tons
of these wooden bullets,

242
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,634
So nothin' funky.

243
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,933
You don't wanna do this.
trust me.

244
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,634
Aah! ow!

245
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:54,768
That's what you get.

246
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:55,867
For what?

247
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,900
You made me like this.

248
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,934
I killed you.
i didn't turn you.

249
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:02,400
See, i know what you
and your brother are.

250
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,268
I've been watchin'
the two of you.

251
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,300
I knew
you'd show up here,

252
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,901
And i'm glad you did,
'cause i have
some questions.

253
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,734
Me first.
who turned you?

254
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,600
How should i know?

255
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,101
Last thing
i remember is i'm about
to stake your brother,

256
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,234
And then you grabbed me.
that's it.

257
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:20,967
Until i wake up
in the ground

258
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:23,834
Behind a used-car
dealership on highway 4.

259
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,734
Somebody buried me.

260
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:29,400
It happens. ow.

261
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,433
You bit me.

262
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:31,400
Damn it.

263
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,101
It had to be you.

264
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:36,367
You have to have vampire blood
in your system when you die.

265
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,801
I didn't do that.

266
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,300
Some other vampire
found you,

267
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,500
Gave you their blood.

268
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,600
[groans]

269
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,667
Who?

270
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,934
That's what i wanna know.

271
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,700
Dude, it's not like
the welcome wagon

272
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,001
Was waiting
with a bundt cake
and a handbook.

273
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,700
It's been
a learn-as-you-go
process.

274
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,801
You know, one minute,

275
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:55,201
I'm a small-town
on-the-rise news guy,

276
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:57,634
And next thing
i know, i can't get
into my house,

277
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:00,001
Because my foowowon'
go through the door.

278
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:01,300
You have to be
invited in.

279
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,067
I know. i live alone.

280
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,134
Ah. heh heh.
that sucks.

281
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,867
So now i'm
at the ramada watchin'
pay-per-view all day,

282
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:08,967
Eating everything
in sight,

283
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,567
Including housekeeping.

284
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:11,801
It could be worse.

285
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:14,934
All i can
think about is blood
and killing people.

286
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:16,534
I can't stop
killing people.

287
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,134
I keep killing.
heh heh.

288
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:20,168
And i like it.

289
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:21,634
I'm conflicted.

290
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,034
Welcome to the club.

291
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:25,567
Wait a minute.

292
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,567
Cops only found
one body.

293
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,367
I left one. i was tired.

294
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:32,067
But i've been hidin'
the st o othe bodies.

295
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,400
They're
right back there.

296
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,534
You're kidding.

297
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:35,867
They're just pilin' up.

298
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,667
[music playing]

299
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,134
[no audible dialogue]

300
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:50,001
So what do we know?

301
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,934
Nothing new
to report yet.

302
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,901
My highly
reliable deputies
are all on alert,

303
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,934
But if you feel the need
to be more proactive,

304
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:02,001
By all means,
grab a stake
and have at it.

305
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:03,700
What extra precautions
can we take?

306
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,367
For right now, there's
nowhere safer than
a crowded public place,

307
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,067
And for once, mayor,
we actually know
where our kids are.

308
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,201
What do you want?

309
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:24,201
Hey. uh, just surprised
to see you here.

310
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,634
Art usually implies culture,

311
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:27,867
And culture implies,
well, not you.

312
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,500
Go to hell.

313
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,101
Still wanna be
an astronaut?

314
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:47,433
I can't believe
you remember that.

315
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:49,801
I can remember
the tinfoil that
you wore on your head.

316
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:50,801
I was 8.

317
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,101
How are you doing?

318
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,901
I've had it easier.

319
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,634
You?

320
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:06,234
Uh, i heard some things.

321
00:15:07,268 --> 00:15:09,934
So it's true
that you and stefan...

322
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:12,268
Yeah, it is.

323
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:13,967
What about you...

324
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:15,901
Matt donovan?

325
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,067
I heard about caroline.

326
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:20,834
Aw, man, not you, too.

327
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:21,867
Hey.

328
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,067
We're friends.

329
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:25,333
It's not a big deal.

330
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,500
No?

331
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,400
No.

332
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:42,234
Why am i
so overly emotional?

333
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,134
All i can think about
is my ex-girlfriend.

334
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:47,734
I wanna be with her
and bite her and stuff.

335
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:49,867
Well, you probably
love her.

336
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:53,300
Anything you felt before
will be magnified now.

337
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,834
You're gonna have to learn
how to control that.

338
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:57,634
What about
walkin' in the sun?

339
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:58,867
I'm a morning person.

340
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:01,667
You can walk in the sun,
which, by the way,

341
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,234
Is pretty cool.

342
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,168
Council'd never
suspect you.

343
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,001
It's not
in the journals.

344
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,367
The journals?

345
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,767
Yeah,
the founding fathers,

346
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,268
They passed down
journals to their kids.

347
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:13,801
Come on, man.
you gotta tell me.

348
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,300
How can you walk around
in the sun?

349
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,201
Who turned you?

350
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:19,234
How do you walk
in the sun?

351
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,400
Who turned you?

352
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,067
You know, i've been
really nice so far,

353
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,734
But i will kill you.

354
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,867
Then you'll never know.

355
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:31,567
You're not answering
my question.

356
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:32,934
You first.

357
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,400
Seems we're at a bit
of an impasse then, doesn't it?

358
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,700
I have things to do,
people to kill.

359
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,600
Guess i'll be needing
a little head start.

360
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,067
Aaaah!

361
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,067
Ow.

362
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,934
Ahh. damn it.

363
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm guessing you're not here
to plan the path
for your future.

364
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,901
You're looking out
for me.

365
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:59,333
Hope that's ok.

366
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,734
You know, i wanted
to be a doctor

367
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:20,534
Before everything
happened, but, uh,

368
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,034
Then i couldn't,
cause...

369
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:24,067
The blood.

370
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,400
Yeah.

371
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,667
I've dabbled in a bunch of different
things, though.

372
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,333
Didn't love anything
enough to stick to it?

373
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,367
No, i--i loved it all.

374
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:38,168
I just--i had to
move on before

375
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:42,834
Anybody could notice
that i wasn't getting
any older.

376
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
How long before
th would happen?

377
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,534
Few years, usually.

378
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,667
Sometimes shorter.

379
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,867
And you always left.

380
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:54,500
I didn't have a choice.

381
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,801
So what about--
what about you?

382
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:04,700
What are your, uh,
plans for the future?

383
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,101
I don't wanna talk
about my future, stefan,

384
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:09,834
Because everything
you're saying is making it
perfectly clear

385
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,934
That you're
not gonna be in it.

386
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,433
Elena, it's not that
i don't wanna  in it.

387
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:16,600
You can' i get it.

388
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,567
I heard you the first me
and the second time,

389
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,901
And i appreciate you
looking out for me,

390
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,500
But, please, if you're
gonna leave, then just go.

391
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:29,934
Hide me.

392
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,300
What's going on?

393
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,300
The scum fell
has landed.

394
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,934
Logan's here.

395
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:36,967
Wait. logan fell?

396
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:00,867
Stefan, what's going on?

397
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:04,067
Jenna, are you
dodging me?

398
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:05,567
It's a form of
self-preservation.

399
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:08,433
Um, elena, why don't
you and jenna go
somewhere else.

400
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,300
Let's go.

401
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,467
What are you
doin' here?

402
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,434
You know, your brother
asked me the same thing.

403
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:25,700
In fact, why don't we just skip past 
all that who-turned-me stuff

404
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,034
And get the answer
that i want?

405
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,401
How can i turn into
a daywalker?

406
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:32,833
Damon and i are the only 2
that i know of.

407
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,900
But you're both very cagey
on the how,

408
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Which tells me
that there is a way.

409
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:41,067
You know, in case
you hadn't noticed

410
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,401
I'm quite the celebrity
in this town.

411
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:47,733
It would be very, very easy
for me to expose you.

412
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:53,833
You wanna know how you can 
walk around in the sun?

413
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,034
I do.

414
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,434
You can't.

415
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:04,900
Don't ever
threaten me again.

416
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:14,967
When logan came to the house,
what did he say?

417
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:17,467
[groans] fake flattery.
stupid, dimpled grin.

418
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,833
Puppy dog eyes.

419
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,833
I'm serious, jenna.

420
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,167
How did he act?
what did he say?

421
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,167
He was the usual logan,
was charming,

422
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,301
Little more manic
than usual.

423
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:28,201
He kept trying to convince me
to let him in.

424
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,167
Ok, listen to me
very carefully.

425
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,733
Do not,
under any circumstances,

426
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:39,767
Talk to him again.
i'm serious, jenna, like, ever.

427
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,401
Hey. elena.

428
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:44,401
Jenna.

429
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:45,501
Hi, mr. saltzman.

430
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:47,800
Yeah, i was hopin'
to, uh, see you tonight.

431
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Career night
is the new bowling.

432
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Ah. heh heh.

433
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,867
Ok. um, excuse me.

434
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:54,534
Damon:
logan fell's
a vampire,

435
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:57,700
And when i find him
again, i am gonna
destroy him

436
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,134
Limb by limb.

437
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,401
What happened? you ok?

438
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,534
No. i'm not ok.

439
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:04,967
i was ambushed.

440
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,601
I was shot.

441
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,401
Now i'm vengeful.
just gotta find him.

442
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:13,401
Well, there's no need.
he's here at the school.

443
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:14,401
You're kidding me.

444
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,367
Why the hell
is he there?

445
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:17,934
He's workin' the crowd.

446
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:20,234
Well, i'll be
right there.

447
00:21:22,234 --> 00:21:26,067
So anything
you'd like to share?

448
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,367
What are you doin'?

449
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:29,301
Following my future.

450
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:32,401
Broadcast
journalism?

451
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:33,568
Yes.

452
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,000
Broadcast journalism.

453
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,967
Why are you looking
at me like that?

454
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,767
You don't even
read the paper.

455
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:48,733
Liz.

456
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:51,934
Logan.

457
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:54,267
What are you gonna do,
stake me?

458
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:56,800
Bury me in another
shallow grave?

459
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,934
What would the e-mail
say this time?

460
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,601
I didn't have a choice.

461
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:02,367
You bitch.

462
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:06,134
I died for you,
for this town.

463
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:09,401
You've known me
since i was 6,

464
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:12,668
And you swept me
under the rug like dirt.

465
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,401
You knew what you
were getting into.

466
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:15,833
I was one of you.

467
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,201
And now you're
one of them.

468
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,134
Watch your back,
sheriff.

469
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,301
Get a backup team
to the school
immediately.

470
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:36,867
Keep it within
the circle. it's a v5.

471
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:38,434
I didn't know you drew.

472
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:39,634
It's an elective.

473
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,767
'cause it's good stuff.
you like graphics?

474
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:44,301
'cause that's, uh--
that's kind of my thing.

475
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:46,134
Whoa. whoa.
what are you doin'?

476
00:22:46,134 --> 00:22:48,301
Well, it's just
something else
we have in common.

477
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,967
And what's
the other thing? vicki?

478
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,100
Let's hang out because
we did the same chick?

479
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,733
Go be friends with
one of the many other
guys that she screwed.

480
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:56,767
There's
no shortage of 'em.

481
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:01,301
Whoa. whoa.
hey, hey, hey.

482
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,833
Hey, hey. hey.

483
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,501
All right, work it out,
tough guy.

484
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:07,034
You two,
follow me.

485
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,301
Excuse me, mayor.

486
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:13,867
Where are you
takin' 'em?

487
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:15,167
I'm gonna talk to 'em.

488
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:17,167
All fights should end
in handshakes, don't you think?

489
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,467
Bonnie, where are you?
i'm ready to go.

490
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,267
I'll be outside.

491
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,401
Hey, damsel in distress.

492
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:27,568
Need a ride?

493
00:23:27,568 --> 00:23:30,568
Oh, my god.
logan fell, channel 9,
is that you?

494
00:23:30,568 --> 00:23:33,534
I used to baby-sit you,
caroline forbes. don't mock me.

495
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:36,267
Well, i was supposed
to go home with bonnie,

496
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:37,800
But i can't find her.

497
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,668
It's not a problem, really.

498
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:42,301
it's on my way.

499
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:43,301
Ok.

500
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,067
You know,
this is fate.

501
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,100
And why is that?

502
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
'cause i'm interested
in broadcast journalism.

503
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,367
So can i ask you
a couple questions?

504
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:04,367
Anything you want.

505
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:06,733
First, buckle up.

506
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:18,467
Matt: hey.

507
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:20,501
Hey, have you seen logan fell,
the news guy?

508
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,467
Yeah. he just
gave caroline
a ride home.

509
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:26,167
Stay here.

510
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:35,567
Ok.

511
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:38,467
Let's get this
out of your system.

512
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,867
Go ahead. fight.

513
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,434
You want us to what?

514
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:44,267
I'm not gonna
fight him, dad.

515
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,300
I don't think so, sir.

516
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,467
You don't fight
in there like pansies.

517
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:56,034
You take it outside, fight your battles
like men, and move on.

518
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:59,233
Best lesson
my dad taught me.

519
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,701
So let's settle it.

520
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:02,701
Fight.

521
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:03,901
Come on, dad.

522
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,601
It's not gonna happen.

523
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:08,068
I said fight!

524
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:09,367
Whoa. what's
goin' on out here?

525
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:11,934
Just lettin'
these 2 kids work it out.

526
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,901
We're good here.
go back inside.

527
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:16,567
I don't wanna go
back inside.

528
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,467
What i want
is an answer
to my question.

529
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,801
What's goin' on
out here?

530
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:24,300
Who do you think
you're talkin' to?
