I have lived in secret-</i>

<i>Until now.
I know the risk,</i>

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,480
<i>- But I have to know her.
- Elena...</i>

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,240
<i>She's a dead ringer
for Katherine.</i>

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,480
You have no idea of the
future I have planned for us.

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,320
You, me, and Damon.

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,880
Our love for Katherine
wasn't real, Damon.

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,120
Katherine never compelled
me. I knew everything.

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,160
It was real for me.

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,280
I'm going
to bring her back.

12
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,320
Tell me how to get
into the tomb.

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,920
- The Grimoire.
- Where is it?

14
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,760
Check the journal,
Jonathan Gilbert's.

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,440
Can I borrow
your ancestor's journal?

16
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,560
I gave it to
my history teacher.

17
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,760
- Alaric Saltzman.
- Damon.

18
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,680
So the Grimoire,
that as Emily's, right?

19
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,360
That's what you need
to reverse the spell?

20
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,200
- I'll help you.
- Ok.

21
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
I told Damon that I'd help
him get Katherine back.

22
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,520
But it was a lie.
I can't let him do it.

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,920
Then don't. And I'll help
you. Whatever it takes.

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,720
Please!

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,200
Please, help us!

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
Please, my husband,
he's been hurt!

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,840
Please help him!

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,160
What are you doing out her
in the middle of the night?

29
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,360
It's not safe.

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
No. No, sir.

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
It's not safe.

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,160
And that's how
it's done.

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
What happens
to the bodies?

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,800
Well, I'll take them
into the woods

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,960
And the other animals
will finish them off.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,520
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm ready.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
I want you
to turn me.

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,880
When it's time.

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,320
Kiss me.

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,880
You should get a taste.

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,600
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,120
Soon you won't be able
to get enough.

Mmm.

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,000
Mmm, good morning.

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,400
I could get used
to this.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,840
Rise and shine,
sleepyheads.

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,760
- Damon! Please!
- What are you doing?

50
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,040
Oh, stop being smutty.

51
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,240
Seriously,
get out of here!

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,680
If I see something
I haven't seen before,

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
I'll throw a dollar at it.
Now listen,

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,080
We have some very important
business to discuss.

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,360
And it has to be
right now?

56
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
Well, we have lots to do,
now that we're all friends

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,280
and working toward
a common goal.

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
So, in order
to open the tomb,

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,960
We need to find the journal

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,720
to get the Grimoire
to open the spells.

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
First things first-
since you are Elena Gilbert,

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
you're on journal duty.

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
Since when
am I helping?

64
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
Well, Stefan's helping,
and you've taken up residence

65
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,560
in Stefan's bed, ergo...

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,720
- I'll look for it tonight.
- Good.

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,320
How do we know
that this journal

69
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,000
will hold the location
of the Grimoire?

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,800
We're really going to take
the word of this vampire?

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,520
In lieu of any other options.

72
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,360
Ok, what exactly is
a Grimoire, anyway?

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
It's a witch's cookbook.

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,760
Every spell
that a witch casts

75
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,200
is unique unto itself,

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,040
so every witch
would document their work.

77
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,800
Yeah. Cookbook.

78
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,000
What about our
mystery vampire?

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,880
Dimwit obviously
wasn't working alone,

80
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,920
So whoever's out there
knows who we are.

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
And I don't like that
disadvantage, so...

82
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,560
Chop, chop.

83
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,400
You know, I really like this whole
ménage-threesome team thing.

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
It's got a bit
of a kink to it.

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Don't screw it up.

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,440
He does have-

87
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,640
Oh, right, yeah.

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,560
Ok.

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
Oh! No, come here.

90
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,000
- We shouldn't...
- Shh.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
What are you doing?
Stop it!

92
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,760
Make me.

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,720
Yes?

94
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,960
Excuse me, miss Katherine.

95
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
Miss Pearl
is here to see you.

96
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll be down soon.

97
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,080
Please ask her to wait.

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,920
Thank you, Emily.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
- Fun's over.
- Hmm, no.

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
It's good
to see you, Pearl.

101
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,280
Perhaps we could
talk outside.

102
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,520
Emily, would you please
tell Mr. Salvatore

103
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
That I've stepped away?

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,280
Which one?

105
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,240
Both.

106
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,280
How long do you plan on
staying with the Salvatores?

107
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,520
People talk,
Katherine.

108
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
You, carrying on
with both brothers,

109
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
doesn't help
the situation.

110
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,640
The salvatores have been
kind to take me in.

111
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,320
As far as everyone here knows,

112
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
I'm a poor orphan girl
from Atlanta,

113
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
lost her family
in the fires.

114
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,480
A match you lit,
no doubt.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
Honey, please
be careful.

116
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,520
Honorary Fell came by
the apothecary yesterday

117
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
With a case
of this elixir.

118
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,560
She asked that it be
sold at a reduced rate.

119
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,640
- I don't follow.
- Try it.

120
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,680
- What in hell?
- Vervain.

121
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
Why is there-

122
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,360
They know.

123
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,600
They're trying to find us, and
they're getting crafty about it.

124
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,360
The townspeople
ingesting vervain?

125
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,080
Well, that's inconvenient.

126
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,320
It might be time for us
to move on again.

127
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,800
No. I like it here.

128
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,560
I'm not interested
in leaving just yet.

129
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,240
Can we go, mama?

130
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Is something wrong?

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,640
Hey, it's me again.

132
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,240
Anna.
Soccer chick

133
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,160
and foosball
champion.

134
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,560
I'll be at the grill
later, if you want,

135
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,280
you know, a
rematch, or whatever.

136
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,760
Who are you calling?

137
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,080
Jeremy Gilbert.

138
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,760
You're not, like,
into him, are you?

139
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,240
I need him for
something. Get over it.

140
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Oh! Mmm!

141
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,200
Damn it!

142
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,520
Dude, you gotta stop
doing that.

143
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,360
I know. I just-
I keep forgetting.

144
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,040
You're new.

145
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,800
You'll get it.

146
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,080
You found
the Gilbert journal?

147
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,480
Does that look like
the Gilbert journal?

148
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,280
Well, it's old and musty,

149
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,880
and how am I supposed
to know the difference?

150
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,440
I don't know, I figured
maybe, just maybe,

151
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,000
you've been paying a little
bit of attention since we met.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,800
You know, you don't
have to talk down to me.

153
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,600
I'm not stupid.

154
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,080
Here.

155
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,360
Drink.

156
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
I don't want you getting
itchy around the witch.

157
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,920
She can sense
if you're weak.

158
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,520
When can we
go hunting again?

159
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,840
This tastes old.
I want fresh blood.

160
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,280
When we get that tomb open,

161
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,480
you can kill
anyone you want.

162
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,160
For now,
just stay focused on Bonnie

163
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,040
while I try to get the journal
back from Jeremy's teacher.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Why did you choose me?

165
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,640
I needed someone in a position
to be my eyes and ears.

166
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,880
Small town bartender
fit the bill

167
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,200
There are plenty of
bartenders to choose from.

168
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,120
Why me?

169
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,040
You were sad then.

170
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,400
You lacked purpose.

171
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,320
You needed me.

172
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,080
Do you think Damon
really believes us?

173
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,920
That we're both
trying to help him?

174
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,680
I don't think Damon
knows what to believe.

175
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,200
Trust isn't something
that comes naturally to him.

176
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,680
You know...

177
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,120
I rely think
that Damon believes

178
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,280
that everything he's done,
every move that he's made,

179
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,960
he's done for love.

180
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,840
It's twisted,
but kind of sad.

181
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,000
There are other ways
to get what you want.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,080
You don't have
to kill people.

183
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,360
Damon has no regard
for human life.

184
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,120
He enjoys inflicting
pain on others.

185
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,520
For 145 years,

186
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,960
Every single time that I
have let my guard down

187
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,600
And let Damon
back into my life,

188
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,280
He's done something
to make me regret that.

189
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,080
I'm not going to make
that mistake again.

190
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,680
So what do you think
will happen

191
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,480
if the tomb gets opened
and Damon gets Katherine back?

192
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,800
I think that no matter
what Damon promises,

193
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
A lot of people
will die.

194
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,080
That's Jonathan Gilbert.

195
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
What's this?

196
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,720
What are you guys doing?

197
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,000
Hey. Just going
through some stuff,

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,640
feeling sentimental.

199
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,680
Dad had this whole family
journal from years ago.

200
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,800
I thought
I'd dig it up.

201
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,080
Jonathan Gilbert's journal?

202
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,600
Yeah, what do you
know about it?

203
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,080
I just did
a history report on it.

204
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,600
Oh. So where is it now?

205
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,760
I gave it to Mr. Saltzman.
He wanted to see it.

206
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,080
<i>I met Barnett and
Giuseppe this evening.</i>

207
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,720
<i>I saw the skepticism in their eyes
when I showed them the compass.</i>

208
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,960
We're supposed to believe
that can track one of them?

209
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,640
What is it, magic?

210
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,680
It's science.

211
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,080
I'll believe it
when I see it.

212
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
I've been thinking
about this church idea.

213
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,120
I believe
it could work.

214
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,800
Excuse me, father.

215
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
I didn't know
you had guests.

216
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,840
We'll be done
in a few minutes, son.

217
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,960
I'll come back.
Forgive me, Mr. Gilbert,

218
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,480
Mr. Lockwood.

219
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Have you told them?

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,680
Not yet.

221
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,600
Giuseppe, we need all
the men we can get.

222
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,720
I'll tell them.

223
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,880
You can count
on both my boys.

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,320
Hello?

225
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,760
Hello?

226
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,680
Someone there?

227
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,600
You shouldn't have
done that.

228
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,760
Have a seat.

229
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
What is this,
compressed air?

230
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,880
Did you make it
yourself?

231
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,400
Who are you?

232
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
I'm not going
to hurt you...

233
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,160
unless you
try that again.

234
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,000
Now...

235
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,240
Who are you?

236
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,480
I'm a teacher.

237
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,920
Are we going to have
to do this the hard way?

238
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm also a historian.

239
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,200
And while researching
Virginia, I-

240
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,400
made a few discoveries
about your town.

241
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,080
So you show up
like Van Helsing.

242
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,240
Come on.

243
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,360
Tell me the truth.

244
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,680
My wife
was a parapsychologist.

245
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,200
She spent her life researching
paranormal activity in this area.

246
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,720
It was her work
that led me here.

247
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,160
Where's your wife?

248
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,680
Dead.

249
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,160
A vampire killed her.

250
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,320
Where's
the Gilbert journal?

251
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,000
- What do you want with it?
- Where is it?

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,800
- It's on my desk.
- No, it's not.

253
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,960
It was on my desk.

254
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,200
Anything?

255
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,080
Not yet.
Just a lot of gibberish.

256
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,800
Yeah, some people
just shouldn't journal.

257
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,440
I thought this Gilbert
was the brains.

258
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,160
Don't you have a date?

259
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,360
Yep.

260
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,640
Wish me luck.

261
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,320
Ehh.

262
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,560
<i>I saw her again today-</i>

263
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,640
<i>The most beautiful woman
in town,</i>

264
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,680
<i>With a name just
as pretty, Pearl.</i>

265
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,200
Have you thought any more
of what I've said?

266
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,440
We'll leave soon,
Pearl, I promise.

267
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,680
I need to take care
of a few things first.

268
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,080
You're going to turn
both of them, aren't you?

269
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,040
Katherine, please.

270
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,800
Be careful.

271
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,000
We'll all be safe,
I promise.

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,440
Mr. Gilbert's
coming.

273
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,880
Quick, your cheeks.

274
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,360
Perfectly rosie.

275
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,200
Miss Pearl.

276
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,360
May I have a moment?

277
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,840
Yes Mr. Gilbert.

278
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,680
I'm still
waiting for you

279
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,400
to explain
that comet in the sky.

280
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,080
Your mother
has an admirer.

281
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,840
As descendants of
the founding families,

282
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
they'll want to know that
they can count on you.

283
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,880
Of course they can.

284
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,640
Is there any doubt?

285
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,080
I'm not sure
your bother Damon

286
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,840
understands
the importance of duty.

287
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,440
Damon left the
confederacy on principle.

288
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,640
It was his choice
and should be respected.

289
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,040
You'll forgive me if I have
trouble respecting a deserter.

290
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,400
Well, I never asked
for your respect.

291
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,480
Good for you, Damon.

292
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,640
Because all I have
is disappointment.

293
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,720
You said the town
is in trouble?

294
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,040
There's been too many deaths.

295
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,320
It is time for us
to fight back

296
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,680
and stop these killers.

297
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,160
Killers? What are you
talking about?

298
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,360
We live amongst demons.

299
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,560
You're being cryptic
now, father.

300
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,400
Why don't you just
say the word?

301
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,800
Vampires.

302
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,440
They exist.

303
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,960
And they live amongst us.

304
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,520
But we have
a plan to kill them.

305
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,120
And you're going
to help us.

306
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,440
My father never approved
of anyone I dated,

307
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,160
which only made me
want them more.

308
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,000
Of course.

309
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,920
What about you?

310
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,440
There were
a few guys.

311
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,840
Logan isn't the only
loser I've dated.

312
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,160
They ever find him?
Or is he still missing?

313
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,840
He's not missing.

314
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,000
He's in the Bahamas
working on his tan.

315
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,160
Very entitled,
that one.

316
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,040
Marches
to his own drum.

317
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,880
He's foul.

318
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,040
They're all snooty.

319
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,800
Hello, Elena.

320
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,240
Hey. Where have you been?

321
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,560
We're cooking dinner.

322
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,680
Is Stefan with you?

323
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,440
He'll be here soon.

324
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,200
How long have you been
aware of me?

325
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,560
I learned just recently.

326
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,080
What about your brother?

327
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,920
You met Damon.

328
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,800
Who do you think
killed my wife?

329
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
Are you certain
it was Damon?

330
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,440
I witnessed it.

331
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,800
If you're here
for revenge,

332
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,560
this is going to end
very badly for you.

333
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,080
I just want to find out
what happened to my wife.

334
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,440
I thought you just said
that Damon-

335
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,360
Yeah.

336
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,200
I saw him

337
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,280
draining the life
out of her.

338
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,880
He must have heard me
coming.

339
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,920
He just...Disappeared.

340
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,000
So did her body.

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,800
They never found her

342
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,800
Damon can never know
why you're here.

343
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,320
He'll kill you
without blinking.

344
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,000
I can take care
of myself.

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,400
No,
you can't.

346
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,880
I can help you.

347
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,560
If you let me.

348
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,560
Whoa. Mmm.

349
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,440
Don't do that.

350
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,520
Do what?

351
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,920
You know what.
That move was deliberate.

352
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,200
Well, yeah, I was
deliberately trying

353
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,800
to get to the sink.

354
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Speaking of Stefan,

355
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,920
where is he?

356
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,000
He's missing
family night,

357
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,240
which I am enjoying
immensely.

358
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is it real?

359
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,320
Is what real?

360
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,000
This renewed sense
of brotherhood.

361
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,640
Can I trust him?

362
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,360
Yes, you can trust him.

363
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,200
Can I trust him?

364
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm wearing vervain, Damon.
It's not going to work.

365
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm not
compelling you.

366
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,720
I just want you
to answer me.

367
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,920
Honestly.

368
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,560
Of course you can.

369
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,040
You can
trust me, Mr. Salvatore.

370
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,800
I would never cheat.

371
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,320
I'm losing over here.

372
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,440
Again!

373
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,440
She's good.

374
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,080
I almost believe
she genuinely likes him.

375
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,360
Perhaps she does.

376
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,320
She knows father would have
her killed if he knew the truth.

377
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,680
Not if we talk
to him;

378
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,080
explained how we feel.

379
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,480
He could help us
keep her safe.

380
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,680
Have you gone mad?

381
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,480
No, no, father would
drive the stake in her himself!

382
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,840
That's not true.
We can trust him.

383
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,040
No, no, not with this.

384
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,160
Please, promise me
you won't tell him, Stefan.

385
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,120
I promise.

386
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,280
There was a time when
I trusted him more than anyone.

387
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,880
Trust breeds trust.

388
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,480
You have to give it
to get it.

389
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,520
Are you lecturing me?

390
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,000
Do you need
to be lectured?

391
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,600
I just want her back.

392
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,640
I'm sure you can
understand that.

393
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,600
I can understand that you
would do anything for her, yes.

394
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,000
Then you understand
what I will do

395
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,080
if anyone
gets in my way.

396
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,920
You said you never
played this thing before.

397
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm a fast learner.
Quick reflexes.

398
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,440
Who are you dodging?

399
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,120
This girl Anna.

400
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,280
She can be, uh,
persistent.

401
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,120
Is she hot?

402
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,200
Yeah yeah,
but she can be weird.

403
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,240
Hot trumps weird,
trust me.

404
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,440
He is
ridiculously hot!

405
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,760
Shh!

406
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,320
He's an ass.

407
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,760
What are you doing
with all this stuff?

408
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,560
I thought there
might be something

409
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,560
about my birth
parents.

410
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,680
Have you told
Jeremy?

411
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,440
I will.

412
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,680
When the time is right.

413
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,040
That's Stefan.

414
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,560
Dude!

415
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,760
Well?

416
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,240
Admit it.

417
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,360
I can't sing.

418
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
No. You were great.

419
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,400
Come on, totally trashed
a Metallica song.

420
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,920
Well, first mistake,
Metallica karaoke?

421
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,080
Well, at least
I could admit it.

422
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,360
The woman with
the tattoos loved you.

423
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,720
Yeah, well, next time,

424
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,480
I'm going to throw out
my pearl jam.

425
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,400
Next time?

426
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,080
Yeah.

427
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,560
So, uh,

428
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,920
What are your friends
up to tonight?

429
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,520
They're all doing
their own thing.

430
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,360
Caroline's at her dad's,
Elena's with her boyfriend.

431
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,600
Elena Gilbert, right?

432
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,920
Yeah, I remember.
You guys used to hang out.

433
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,600
She's my best friend.

434
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,720
Yeah, my friends, they all
moved away after graduation,

435
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,000
and I didn't.

436
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,560
So we just kind of
drifted apart.

437
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,080
Oh. Elena and I are
bonded for life.

438
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,160
I can't imagine it
either way.

439
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,760
That tight, huh?

440
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,640
She's my sister.
I mean, I'd die for her.

441
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,960
Huh.

442
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,520
- Who took it?
- I don't know.

443
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,600
You know what,
it's that teacher.

444
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,800
There's something
really off about him.

445
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,920
No, he doesn't know
anything.

446
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,600
Somebody got to him
right before me.

447
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Who else knew it was there?

448
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,000
No. Damon,
leave him out of it!

449
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,200
Why, what's
the big deal?

450
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,320
Damon!

451
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,680
So...

452
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,000
I heard you found
a really cool journal

453
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,840
from back in the day.

454
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,000
- Who else did you show it to?
- Huh?

455
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,480
Don't ask questions,
just spill.

456
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,240
You're kidding me, right?

457
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,760
Jer, did you tell anyone
other than Mr. Saltzman

458
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,360
about Jonathan Gilbert's
journal?

459
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,400
Why is everybody
so obsessed with that thing?

460
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,440
Who else did you tell?

461
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,600
- Just that girl Anna.
- The hot weird one?

462
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,120
- Yeah.
- Wait, who is Anna?

463
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,200
That's what I want
to find out.

464
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,440
How do you know her?

465
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,440
I just know her.

466
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
She wants me to meet her
at the grill tonight.

467
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,080
Perfect. I'll drive.

468
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,000
- Come on.
- Ok.

469
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Ok, I'm alone.

470
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,640
<i>Give me all the deets,
Bonnie. I'm dying.</i>

471
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,000
It's going great.
He's a perfect gentleman.

472
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,840
- Gentleman, huh?
- I know!

473
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,480
Boring, huh? I just want to
grab him and lay one on him.

474
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,440
<i>Why don't you?</i>

475
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,720
'cause I'm a chicken.

476
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,640
You're a
powerful witch goddess.

477
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,880
Come on, seize the day,
Broom Hilda.

478
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,320
Ok.

479
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,080
I'm going to text you later
with more details.

480
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,440
You better.

481
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,800
Where's Damon?

482
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,640
He left to track down
Jeremy's friend Anna,

483
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,000
see if there was
anything there.

484
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,360
Aren't you going
to go with him?

485
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,800
If he gets to the journal
before we do, then...

486
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,560
Doesn't matter.

487
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,840
- What is that?
- It's a copy of it.

488
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,280
How did you get it?

489
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,040
Well, Mr. Saltzman
made a copy

490
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,520
And was kind enough
to loan it to me.

491
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,280
He did?

492
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,000
Not exactly, but I got it.

493
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,480
You just couldn't
live without me, huh

494
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,760
Well, I kinda miss my daily
dose of cute stalker chick.

495
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,040
Oh, funny.

496
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,120
Let's play.

497
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,440
The sheriff
was here earlier.

498
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,880
He bought large volumes
of the vervain elixir.

499
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Did he try to put his hands
on you again?

500
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,440
- Doesn't he always?
- She's saving herself

501
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,880
For Jonathan Gilbert.

502
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm beyond saving.
We know that.

503
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,440
How can you be so calm?

504
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,320
They're getting closer
to you every day.

505
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,040
We are the respectable ladies
of Mystic Falls.

506
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,120
Thanks to Emily, we walk
the streets in daylight.

507
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,720
No one will ever suspect us.

508
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,440
Not unless
a human tells them.

509
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
I'd sooner die.

510
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,400
And soon enough, you will.

511
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,520
Mrs. Fell is approaching.

512
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,960
Thank you,
Annabelle.

513
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,240
Here's a reference that
he wrote about Emily.

514
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,120
"The Fell family
believed it should be I,

515
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
"not them, who protected
the witch's spell book.

516
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,560
But I feared she would
haunt me from the hereafter.

517
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,360
They mocked my fear,
but it was Giuseppe Salvatore who..."

518
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,560
- Is that your father?
- Yeah.

519
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,480
"It was Giuseppe Salvatore
who removed my fear.

520
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,160
"He told me he would protect
the secret of the spell book.

521
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,840
He said he would carry it
to his grave."

522
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
Stefan.

523
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,920
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

524
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,840
Did I interrupt
your writing?

525
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,120
These are the dull musings
of my troubled mind.

526
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,560
A great mind.

527
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,040
Still. I will carry
the real secrets with me-

528
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,800
To your grave.

529
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,960
And a full grave
it will be.

530
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,960
Now, speaking
of troubled minds,

531
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,120
what's on yours?

532
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,200
I have concerns about
your plan for the vampires.

533
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,760
And why is that?

534
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,800
We are making the assumption
that all vampires

535
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,120
are as evil as they've
been characterized,

536
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,800
but what if that's not true?

537
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,400
Do you have any evidence
to the contrary?

538
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,560
Do you know
of any vampires?

539
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,880
No. No, of course not.

540
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,120
But are we to take
what others say

541
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,560
at face value?

542
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,720
You always taught us
so differently.

543
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,080
Stefan...
These creatures

544
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,320
Are of the darkest parts
of hell.

545
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,880
They have the ability
to control your mind,

546
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,200
seduce your spirit.

547
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
They are deadly.

548
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,360
They must be destroyed.

549
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,160
Those who stand
with them;

550
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,440
those who bring shame to their
families will be destroyed as well.

551
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,960
I know where it is.

552
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,120
Ok, I give.

553
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,760
Damn.

554
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,240
You're strong
for a little thing.

555
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,520
I was wondering how long it
would take you to find me.

556
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,120
Why isn't your father
buried in your family's tomb?

557
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,600
It wasn't built
until well after he died.

558
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Are you sure the Grimoire's
in there with him?

559
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,480
As sure
as I could be.

560
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,440
Great.

561
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,000
Elena.

562
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
I can do this
on my own.

563
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,280
And I said I would do
whatever I can to help.

564
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,520
I know, and I appreciate
that, but-

565
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,360
This town is my home, Stefan.

566
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,400
My friends and family
are here. You're here.

567
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,840
I don't want that tomb
opened any more than you do.

568
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,680
I'm sorry that you have
to do this.

569
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,880
What is that?

570
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,160
Gift.

571
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,760
From Damon?

572
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,160
From Emily, actually.

573
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,360
And when will you stop
worrying about Damon?

574
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,520
I want you all
to myself.

575
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,920
Just as he wants me,

576
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,720
but I'm the one who gets
to make all the rules.

577
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,080
And why is that?

578
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
Because I'm spoiled.

579
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
Yes, you are.

580
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,080
- And selfish.
- Mmm.

581
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,720
And because I can do this.

582
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,840
Ahh.

583
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
And this.

584
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,680
And this.

585
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,440
What?

586
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
What?

587
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,160
Vervain.

588
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,320
What?

589
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,560
Katherine!
Katherine!

590
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,320
Go get the sheriff.
Tell him we have a vampire.

591
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,440
What? No!

592
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,040
Do as I say, son!

593
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,440
Nothing that you feel
for her is real.

594
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,080
She's a vampire, Stefan!
A monster!

595
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,400
I fed you vervain hoping
that it would expose her.

596
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,320
How did you know?

597
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,440
Your sympathy
for their plight.

598
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,360
I didn't raise my sons
to be so weak.

599
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,120
The sheriff, now.
Go, quickly!

600
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,200
Now, son!

601
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,040
How long have you been here?

602
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,600
I arrived around
half-past comet,

603
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,280
watching you screw up every
chance you had to open that tomb.

604
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,040
How did you know
about the spell?

605
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,280
I didn't say much
back then,

606
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,440
which means
I heard everything.

607
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,120
So if you've been here
the whole time,

608
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,280
then why are we just
crossing paths right now?

609
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,680
I like to use others
to do my dirty work.

610
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,360
Like Logan Fell?

611
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Oh, yeah, thanks
for that, by the way.

612
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,000
Little bastard shot me.

613
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,240
- Logan was an idiot.
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,160
We slipped him some blood
when he started getting

615
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,000
all poser slayer
with that comps.

616
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,160
I needed his family's journal.
I couldn't let him die.

617
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,280
What'd you want
with the Fell journal?

618
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,120
I thought it contained
the location

619
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,480
of the witch's spell book.

620
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,400
I was wrong.

621
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,240
According to her journal,
Honorea gave the Grimoire

622
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,880
of Jonathan Gilbert.

623
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,600
And, according to this...

624
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,040
He gave it
to your father.

625
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
So now you're going
to help me find it.

626
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,200
Why would I help you?

627
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,920
'cause you and I both
want that tomb open.

628
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,520
Hmm.

629
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,800
Sorry.

630
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,760
I work alone.

631
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,200
Well the check's paid.

632
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,920
I'm all yours tonight.
What do you want to do?

633
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,760
This.

634
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,160
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Sorry.

635
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,440
I just should have waited until
the end of the night to do that.

636
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,720
I didn't mind.

637
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,360
You know,
I'm starting to get tired.

638
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,560
Do you want go?

639
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,400
I was going to say let's
have some more coffee,

640
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,880
get a caffeine buzz,
and, I don't know,

641
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,320
go out,
do something crazy.

642
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,920
Hmm, like what?

643
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,360
Like anything.

644
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,720
Ok. I'm going to
run to the restroom.

645
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,880
- Ok.
- All right.

646
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,040
What?

647
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,840
Not many girls
can say they've done this.

648
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,280
Is that it?

649
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,280
Well,
what do you know?

650
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,600
This is an interesting
turn of events.

651
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,360
I can't let you
bring her back.

652
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,640
I'm sorry.

653
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,360
So am I.

654
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,880
For thinking
for even a second

655
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
that I can
trust you.

656
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,440
Oh. You're not capable
of trust.

657
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
The fact that you're here
means that you read the journal

658
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,360
and you were planning on
doing this yourself.

659
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Of course I was going
to do it by myself,

660
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,680
because the only one
I can count on is me!

661
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,800
You made sure of that
many years ago, Stefan.

662
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,280
But you...

663
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,800
You had me fooled.

664
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,600
So what are you
going to do now?

665
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,320
Because if you try
and destroy that,

666
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,360
I'll rip
her heart out.

667
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,880
You won't kill her.

668
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,720
I can do one better.

669
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,200
Give me the book,
Stefan.

670
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,440
Or I'm stabbing
her neck.

671
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,120
And you and I will have
a vampire girlfriend.

672
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,000
Let her go first.

673
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,640
The Book.

674
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm not going
to give this to you

675
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,480
until she is
standing next to me.

676
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,440
The problem is,
I no longer trust

677
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
that you'll
give it back!

678
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
You just did the one thing
that ensures that I will.

679
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Stop! No
don't take her!

680
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,280
Do you know
what they'll do to you

681
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,640
if you're branded
a sympathizer?

682
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,440
You'll be killed
along with them!

683
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,280
Just let me be killed!

684
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,880
My head supposed
to hurt like this?

685
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,360
Oh, you'll be fine.
That was just

686
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,880
a small amount of blood.

687
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,640
It should pass out of
your system by tomorrow.

688
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,360
Are you ok?

689
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,120
Damon was right.
This is, uh...

690
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,880
This is my fault.

691
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,360
Damon!

692
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,360
Damon! Stop, stop.

693
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,960
I'll help you.

694
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,880
- We'll get her back.
- Help me?!

695
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,120
Don't you think
you've done enough?

696
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,360
You promised
you wouldn't tell him!

697
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,200
I didn't think
this would happen.

698
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,560
You did this.

699
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,880
This is your fault.

700
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,000
<i>I put my faith
in my father,</i>

701
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,920
but Damon
put his faith in me,

702
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,120
and I destroyed that.

703
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,160
This is my fault.

704
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,960
You didn't do
anything wrong.

705
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,840
Don't forget that.

706
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,000
Ok.

707
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm going to get you
that aspirin.

708
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,520
Ok.

709
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,640
You know you're not
staying the night, right?

710
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,640
We're just going
to hang out

711
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,640
- for a little while.
- You're lucky I like you.

712
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,400
Keep the door open.

713
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,000
You got it.

714
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,760
Hey, do you have any aspirin?

715
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,360
Yeah.

716
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,760
Oh, hey, Stefan.

717
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,240
Where'd she go?

718
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,560
- She went to the bathroom.
- Where'd who go?

719
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,240
- He has a friend over.
- Anna.

720
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,320
What's happening?

721
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,760
Get Emily.

722
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,440
Stay hidden.

723
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,280
I'll get us out of here.

724
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,880
- Pearl!
- Jonathan!

725
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Do you see all this?

726
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,200
The town's gone mad
running after the demons.

727
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,680
You!

728
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,640
Jonathan...Please.

729
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
I beg you!

730
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,400
I've got another one
over here!

731
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,600
- Mother!
- Shh, shh!

732
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,240
Come on!

733
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,480
This way!

734
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,840
Shh!

735
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,120
It'll be all right.

736
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,640
You're going
to see her again.

737
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,200
I already know
how protect them.

738
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,120
I'm going
to protect them

739
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,440
Elena!
