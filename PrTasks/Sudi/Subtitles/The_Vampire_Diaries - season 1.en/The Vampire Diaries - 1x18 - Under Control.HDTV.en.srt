I have lived in secret,

- Where is he?
- They have him. I can't get in.

here for revenge, right?

That's exactly what we're here for.

Unh! Uhh!

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,693
How long did it take you to wean yourself
off of it after you last indulged?

30
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:18,295
That's not good.

31
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,130
I'll be fine. It just
takes a little bit of time.

I don't get it. You know,

you don't have to kill to survive.

nothing's been solved.

didn't think it was real.

I really hope you're right,

163

because I've done so much
to protect him from all this.

164
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,501
So how do you deal with it?

165
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,336
What do you mean?

166
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,838
I don't know. With all
the lies and the secrets.

167
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:05,775
You have to lie to everyone
who's important to you.

168
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,712
It's not safe for them to know the truth,

169
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,881
so, yes, I keep it from them,

170
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:13,383
but it's only because I love them.

171
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:18,822
I think Stefan's a good guy,

172
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,191
but, uh...

173
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,461
At the end of the day,
he's still a vampire.

but Stefan's different.

176
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,936
He would never do anything to hurt me.

177
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:36,006
I have no interest in the
founder's day kick-off party.

Far be it for us to break from tradition.

180
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:43,280
The Gilberts have been a part
of this town for 150 years,

181
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:45,448
one of the founding families,

182
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:48,952
and with that distinction
comes certain obligations,

183
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,021
including going to the party.

184
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:54,457
One DA when you can
appreciate the significance,

185
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:57,027
I'll tell you all about your heritage.

186
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:59,629
Hmm. The Gilbert family legacy.

187
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:01,164
I forgot how sacred it was.

188
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm not a Gilbert, so I was
never cool enough to hear it.

189
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:07,070
Why does she hate you?

190
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,572
We used to sleep together.

191
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,275
I'm standing right here.

192
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,246
Why would he write a report on vampires?

193
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:18,682
Do you think he's starting to remember?

194
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,450
Damon took away those memories for good.

195
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:22,586
You don't have to worry about that.

196
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:26,189
Tell you what. Why don't you just ask him?

197
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,225
I... I can't.

198
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,794
Why not? I mean, if he
doesn't know anything,

199
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:34,164
then it's just a-an innocent question.

200
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:37,300
I don't even know how
to talk to him anymore.

201
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:41,838
I mean, we used to be a lot
more open with each other,

202
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:45,308
but now, with all these
secrets just piling up...

203
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,045
You know, I haven't even
told him that I'm adopted yet.

204
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:53,416
Maybe it's time you start
opening up to him again.

205
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,586
I'm not saying you should
tell him everything,

206
00:08:56,654 --> 00:09:00,924
but at least try to find out what
he does know and be prepared for it.

207
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,160
What about you? How are you doing?

208
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:06,363
I'm much, much better.

209
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,599
Yeah, I'm... I'm still,
you know, a little, uh...

210
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:13,270
a little jittery, a little
bit on edge, but, uh...

211
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,904
I'm... I'm gonna be ok.

212
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:19,309
I've been really worried
about you, and I missed you.

213
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:22,612
I just needed to lay
low for a little while,

214
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,481
and, uh, let my body readjust.

215
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:26,750
It's only been a few days.

216
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,652
It feels like a lifetime.

217
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,658
I've missed you, too.

218
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:13,296
Stefan, what's wrong?

219
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,200
Stefan.

220
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,198
Oh, good. You're here.

221
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,466
You ask, I come.

222
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:39,101
I'm easy like that.

223
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,506
[Dramatic] No, Elena, I will not...

224
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:46,074
Go to your bedroom with you.

225
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:50,913
Ah...

226
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,347
Just like I remembered.

227
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,016
Stop messing around.

228
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:03,525
You know, did you know that your uncle's
been kickin' it with the founder's council?

229
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:05,226
- What?
- Yep.

230
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,395
Perfect. We'll just add
it to the growing list

231
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:09,831
of how everything's falling apart.

232
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,699
What happened right there?

233
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:15,403
Uh, nothing.

234
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:20,308
Look, Damon, I... I'm
worried about Stefan.

235
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:21,910
He says that everything's ok,

236
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,278
but he's clearly struggling.

237
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:25,380
How long iit gonna take
before he's back to normal?

238
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:26,748
Few days, give or take.

239
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:27,982
It's been a few days.

240
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,717
Give then. I don't know.

241
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:30,885
What's the big deal?

242
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:33,154
He's not himself, Damon.

243
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:38,226
Well, maybe his problem is is he's
spent too long not being himself.

244
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,195
[Sighs]

245
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:44,432
Please don't make me sorry for asking you.

246
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,633
It is what it is, Elena.

247
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:46,634
Hey.

248
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:50,805
The Stefan you know was "good
behavior" Stefan, "reign it in" Stefan,

249
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:54,642
"fight against his nature to an
annoyingly obsessive level" Stefan,

250
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,779
but if you think there's
not another part to this,

251
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,181
then you have not been paying
attention. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

252
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:01,916
He's not you, not even close.

253
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:03,952
Well, he doesn't wanna be me.

254
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:08,623
But that doesn't mean
deep down that he's t.

255
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,926
Mm-hmm.

256
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,298
[Knocks on door]

257
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:51,432
Hey.

258
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,901
What's up?

259
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,836
Do you have some time to talk?

260
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:58,540
Uh, yeah, sure.

261
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,641
Not here.

262
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,110
Come on. Let's get out of the house.

263
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:09,150
I just can't believe mom and dad
never told you that you were adopted.

264
00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:10,919
I'm sure they would have eventually.

265
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:13,521
Why were y worried about what I thought?

266
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,758
Because... I don't know. It's weird...

267
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:21,362
Going your whole life thinking
you're related blood to someone.

268
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,666
Does it bug you that we're not?

269
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:25,800
No. Jer...

270
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,902
You're my brother.
That's all that matters.

271
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:34,442
So Mr. Saltzman said you've
been doing great in history now.

272
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,978
Yeah. Yeah, he's really
been helpin' me out.

273
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:39,380
He gave me some extra credit and stuff.

274
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:42,016
He loved your vampire paper.

275
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:44,285
Yeah, he thought I had a clever angle.

276
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:46,888
What drew you to that subject matter?

277
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,691
Uh, I don't know. Um, boredom.

278
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:53,928
Or maybe I'm just as nuts as
the long line of Gilbert crazies.

279
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:55,496
The Gilberts aren't crazy.

280
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:58,299
Ah, easy for you to say. You're not one.

281
00:13:58,367 --> 00:13:59,867
Ouch.

282
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,569
[Both laugh]

283
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:04,372
[Music playing]

284
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,717
Oh, God.

285
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,051
I shouldn't be here.

286
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,586
Come on. Don't be a downer.

287
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:20,588
It's a party for the founding families.

288
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:23,424
That would be us. It
would be rude to skip it.

289
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:27,095
You know, I... I really liked you a
whole lot better when you hated everybody.

290
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:28,429
Oh, I still do.

291
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:32,000
I just love that they love me. [chuckles]

292
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,036
How you feelin'?

293
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:36,304
I'm good. I'm fine.

294
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,172
No cravings? No urges?

295
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,009
Has that whiskey you been
drinkin' all day doin' its job?

296
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:42,010
Ah heh.

297
00:14:42,077 --> 00:14:44,679
We are who we are, Stan.

298
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:46,047
Pretending doesn't change that.

299
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:47,849
Ah, nothing would make you happier

300
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,451
than to just see me give in, huh, Damon?

301
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,552
Whatever. It's inevitable.

302
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,487
Hmm.

303
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:54,455
M gonna go find Elena.

304
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:56,791
Don't embarrass me, young man.

305
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:07,535
Ahh.

306
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:10,805
I'm so glad you could join us tonight.

307
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,707
It was nice of you to reach out to us.

308
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:15,109
This town is e big family,

309
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:17,111
and when we lose a member,

310
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,613
we all have to come together.

311
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,983
Matt. Kel.

312
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,556
Well, I guess dead kid

313
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:30,892
rates a special greeting
from the mayor, huh?

314
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,894
Go mom.

315
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:34,462
I need a drink.

316
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:36,898
[Sighs]

317
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:38,833
Hey, check it out.

318
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:42,236
Dude, your dad's gonna beat
you down if he catches you.

319
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:43,571
Yeah, let him try.

320
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,173
All right, screw it.

321
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:54,916
Hey.

322
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,652
Hey. How are you?

323
00:15:58,921 --> 00:15:59,787
Are you drunk?

324
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:02,090
[Clears throat] Um...

325
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,660
Ok, I know it's a little weird,

326
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:07,562
but it's really helping me.

327
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,163
The alcohol, it, uh...

328
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:10,765
Takes the edge off.

329
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,533
You're totally that drunk high school guy

330
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:13,768
at the party sneaking booze.

331
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,503
I totally am. Yeah.

332
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:16,571
How worried do I need to be?

333
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:19,207
Oh, no. You don't need to be worried.

334
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:22,577
It's just until, um, the cravings go away.

335
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:26,381
Listen. How about we
enjoy it while it lasts?

336
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:31,519
Would you like to dance
with me you hate dancing.

337
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:32,787
I usually have to beg you.

338
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:35,356
No, no, no. You have to beg the sober me.

339
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,392
The drunk me, there's
no begging necessary.

340
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,794
There's really no one dancing.

341
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:42,630
That's because they need
something better to dance to.

342
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:44,832
Be right back.

343
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,370
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

344
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:52,106
I already tried to bribe the
guy with 20 bucks and a date.

345
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:56,177
He said Carol Lockwood has complete
control over the music choices.

346
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:00,381
You'd be surprised what
Stefan can accomplish

347
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:02,150
when he puts his mind to it.

348
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:03,151
[Fast song playing]

349
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:05,119
[Scattered cheers]

350
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:06,454
Thank God.

351
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:17,932
Have I entered an alternate
universe where Stefan is fun?

352
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,035
Is he gonna be ok?

353
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,303
Eventually.

354
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:25,239

any more information on what
happened to Vicki Donovan.

Yeah, but her body was buried.

news or the really bad news?

Hmm. Actually I don't
want any news, Damon.

All right, let me rephrase.

559

Do you wanna hear how the
council's back in vampire mode

or how just killed uncle John Gilbert?

from the dead 5 minutes ago.

ever embarrass this family.

more times than I can count.

last one to leave a party.

Ok, you obviously know who I am.

663
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,460

00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:46,262
the high school history
teacher with a secret.

665
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:49,064
Sure know a lot for someone
who just got to town.

666
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:52,301
More than you can imagine, Damon.

667
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:56,138
My knowledge of this town
goes beyond anything that you

668
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:58,741
you or the council knows.

669
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:02,077
So if you were planning
on some clever high-speed,

snatch-ring, vamp kill move,

671
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:08,551
know that if I die everything
I know goes to the council,

672
00:36:08,618 --> 00:36:10,419
including the fascinating little tale

673
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:11,787
of the original Salvatore brothers

674
00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:15,224
and their present-day
return to mystic falls.

675
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:18,561
How'd you get that ring?

676
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:23,566
I inherited one, my brother
gray, the other. This was his.

677
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,200
And I wouldn't have given mine to Isobel

678
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,336
had I known she'd hand
it over to another guy.

679
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:28,971
So you did know her.

680
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,573
Who do you think sent her your way

681
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,974
when she wanted to become a vampire?

682
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:33,008
You sent her?

683
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:34,610
Guilty.

684
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:36,478
Why, did you think someone else sent her?

685
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:37,947
Maybe Katherine Pierce?

686
00:36:38,882 --> 00:36:40,816
How do you know about Katherine?

687
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:42,451
How do I know anything, Damon?

688
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,320
What do you want?

689
00:36:44,387 --> 00:36:45,821
So many questions.

690
00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:48,424
It was a pleasure meeting you, Rick.

691
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:50,726
I've heard so much about you.

692
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:06,141

month of these founder's day events.

693

[Sighs] Tell me about it.

694
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,614
You ok?

695
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,048
Fine.

696
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:15,050
Are you sure?

697
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:17,152
I'm fine, Elena.

702
00:37:40,076 --> 00:37:42,745
I'm sorry that I... I ran off earlier.

703
00:37:42,812 --> 00:37:44,046
What happened?

704
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:45,781
Is everything ok?

707
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:51,120
Uh...

708
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:52,755
No.

709
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:54,390
Talk to me.

710
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:05,734
Stefan, tell me.

711
00:38:06,803 --> 00:38:08,570
I tried...

712
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:10,939
So hard to keep it together tonight.

713
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:14,076
[Sighs] And it was
working. It was working,

714
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:17,613
uh, but... but then Matt's mom, she,h,

715
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:19,615
got hurt, and she was bleeding,

716
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:22,451
and I had her... her blood on my hands.

717
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,219
And then what happened?

718
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:26,488
And then that... that
guy in the parking lot,

719
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:28,123
I wanted to feed on him,

720
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:31,060
and it took everything
inside of me not to do it.

721
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:32,127
But you didn't?

722
00:38:32,195 --> 00:38:34,329
No, but I wanted to.

723
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,364
[Sighs] God.

724
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:38,100
Elena, I... my...

725
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:41,003
my head is pounding,

726
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:45,174
I feel like my... skin
is on... is on fire.

727
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:47,643
I have this hunger inside
of me that I've never...

728
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:49,712
I've never felt before in my entire life,

729
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,747
and all I keep thinking about

730
00:38:51,815 --> 00:38:54,316
is how I promised that I would
never keep anything from you,

731
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:55,651
and so I'm telling you this.

732
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,986
That's ok. I need you
to tell me these things.

733
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:00,189
But I don't want you to see me like this.

734
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,858
I don't want you to know
that this side of me exists.

735
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,426
Stefan, you're gonna get through this.

736
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:05,928
I'm gonna help you pull through.

737
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:08,163
It's gonna be ok. You're gonna be ok.

738
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:09,598
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

739
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:14,236
No, I'm sorry. I can't.

740
00:39:14,304 --> 00:39:19,041
I... I'm afraid of what I could do to you.

741
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:23,946
I'm not.

742
00:39:25,515 --> 00:39:26,381
Stefan.

743
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,650
Stefan, I'm not.

744
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:35,290
I'm not, ok?

745
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:48,704
I love you so much.

746
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:52,341
Oh, I love you, too.

747
00:39:55,378 --> 00:39:58,080
[Footsteps]

748
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:04,887
We have a problem, Stefan.

749
00:40:04,954 --> 00:40:08,657
And when I say, "problem,"
I mean global crisis.

750
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,595
Seems uncle John has a...

751
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:18,267
You don't look so good.

752
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:21,637
It's different this time, isn't it?

753
00:40:21,704 --> 00:40:23,839
The need is too strong.

754
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:28,944
Of course it would be
after all these years.

755
00:40:40,323 --> 00:40:42,124
Have a good night, brother.
