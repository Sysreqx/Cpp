1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,338
Previously on Heroes

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,882
I can hear rain coming
from 40 miles away.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,759
I can even hear
someone's moods...

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,469
There are others
out there like you.

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,012
I can feel them.

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,140
We'll find them Mohinder, all of them.
It's our destiny.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,892
Go home Ando.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,145
I made a mistake by
bringing you along.

9
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,022
Hiro, please.

10
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:24,350
I was surprised to learn
the Linderman group

11
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:26,051
recently invested
in your campaign.

12
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:27,711
I don't know why
you'd be surprised.

13
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,410
Mr. Linderman was a good
friend of my fathers.

14
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:31,653
What Mr. Linderman wants, Mr.
Linderman gets.

15
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:35,490
- Has he even located ?
- The haitian? Nah.

16
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:37,530
How long was he hiding, Claire?

17
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:38,820
I take it it's been months.

18
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:41,703
Just one more thing.
When should we be expecting Claire ?

19
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,001
I'll bring her in now.

20
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:44,411
I want her to protect you.

21
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:47,582
I tried to be the
best dad I could.

22
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:48,880
This is goodbye.

23
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:51,840
You don't have to do this.

24
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:54,132
There can't be any doubt
cast on your father.

25
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:55,882
Claire, turn around
cover your ears.

26
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:00,971
Dad. I love you dad.

27
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:03,851
I love you Clare-bear.

28
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:07,152
Go deep. Take anything that
would lead them to her.

29
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,231
With just one bullet
I can be a hero.

30
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:11,610
Show yourself ! No !

31
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:28,292
Chapter Eighteen - Parasite.

32
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:35,512
I choose you.

33
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:39,220
It was supposed to be you.

34
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,183
Can't you do something?

35
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:43,600
She's dead.

36
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:50,692
It can't be.

37
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,121
It's your fault.

38
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,951
You did this to her.

39
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,812
Hey, you stop right there.

40
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,351
What is your problem?

41
00:02:30,606 --> 00:02:32,772
I am here with tour from Osaka.

42
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,390
Security just flagged you.
You must be some kind of cheat.

43
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,820
You already got a warning,

44
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:38,651
and most people
don't even get that.

45
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,113
It is okay.

46
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,491
I am invited now
by Mr. Linderman.

47
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,662
Well, in that case.

48
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,002
You can't stop me!

49
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,803
Bigger men than you have tried.

50
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:57,973
I will find a way inside...

51
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:05,062
somehow.

52
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:10,190
It's all gone.

53
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:14,360
So you honestly don't
remember anything ?

54
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:15,693
I told you I'm trying.

55
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,322
I last thing I remember

56
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,283
is driving home from the
hospital with my wife.

57
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,993
After that, it's grey, blank.

58
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:31,503
So Sprague and Parkman
taking your family hostage,

59
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:33,462
shooting your daughter,

60
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:36,131
a bullet clean
through your side,

61
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:40,510
you think something there
might have made an impression ?

62
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,300
My daughter is missing

63
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:45,182
so right now I don't
care if you believe me

64
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:46,971
or what you do to me,

65
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:49,891
I just want her home. Safe.

66
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:52,352
You can kill me if you want,
I'm gonna to find her!

67
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,021
Settle down. You're tearing your
stiches if you're not careful.

68
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,573
Well, clearly your partner
has gone on the road

69
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:04,572
and taken a pie of slash
of your memory with him.

70
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,991
He did the same thing
to your wife and son.

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,911
They remember even less.

72
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:11,620
- When can I go after them ?
- Sorry.

73
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,961
- Can't let that be your errand.
- She's my daughter!

74
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:18,173
She's an assignment.
Or you've forgotten,

75
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,092
who gave her to you.

76
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,762
Took her out of a bassinet,

77
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:24,212
put her in your hands,
and told you to take her home,

78
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:27,221
and that's after you
said no thank you.

79
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:32,141
Now I appreciate you're taking the
interests beyond the needs of the
assignment, but

80
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:36,063
that indulgence ends now.

81
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:38,190
You expect me to do nothing ?

82
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:41,072
I expect you to do
whatever we ask of you.

83
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:56,500
Well, what do you think ?

84
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,041
He's telling the truth.
He doesn't know anything.

85
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,130
You owe me five bucks.

86
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:05,223
- Come on.
- Wait!

87
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:06,641
We got a deal.

88
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:08,300
I help you out,
you'll let me go.

89
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:10,140
Take it easy, partner.

90
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:12,221
- We'll get there.
- What?

91
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:15,193
Hey! Hey!

92
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:20,903
You haven't said
anything all day.

93
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,402
I thought you preferred it.

94
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:26,360
It's not like you'll tell me
where we're going anyway.

95
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:29,203
As soon as I know where we're going,
I will tell you.

96
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:31,833
When can I go back
to my family ?

97
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:35,161
Should I lie to you and
say it will be soon ?

98
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,120
You know what
we're running from.

99
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,041
Yeah. The people you
and my dad work for.

100
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:41,960
What they will do.

101
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,633
Not even you can recover from.

102
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:49,430
Great. Thanks, dad.

103
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,931
You cannot understand
the level of sacrifice

104
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:54,271
made so you might live.

105
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,600
You must honour that.

106
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:30,263
- Is it safe to go back ?
- No.

107
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:32,762
We leave the country. Tonight.

108
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:00,290
Sorry Mr.
Petrelli, these men wanted to see you.

109
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,292
- They're from...
- The F.B.I.?

110
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm Federal Agent Casada.
This is agent Alonso.

111
00:07:06,346 --> 00:07:08,723
We'd like to speak with you
concerning illegal campaign

112
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:11,843
contributions you may have
received from the Linderman group.

113
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:19,063
The F.B.I. is curious

114
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,563
why the Las Vegas
based Linderman group

115
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,113
would be so interested in
helping a new york business.

116
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:28,240
My father was in charge of the
group before he passed away.

117
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,120
Sorry. We're clear.
No one is listening.

118
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:36,411
You agreed there would
be no face to face.

119
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,543
And you agreed to
deliver Linderman.

120
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:41,122
I'm the one who brought
you in here, remember?

121
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,042
I'd appreciate a
little discretion

122
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:45,253
as opposed to a
surprise office visit.

123
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,720
No one outside this office
knows you're working with us.

124
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:50,382
Linderman requested a meeting
at the casino tonight.

125
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:53,050
- Any guesses why ?
- I'm four points behind.

126
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:55,193
He's going to tell me how he plans to
put me ahead and what he's expecting of
me after I win.

127
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:58,853
We were thinking
the same thing,

128
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:01,350
and we want you to record it.

129
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:03,772
You want me to wear a wire ?

130
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:06,792
You're the only one on our side who
can get enough incriminating evidence

131
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:08,610
to put him behind bars.

132
00:08:08,616 --> 00:08:11,491
We need this Mr.
Petrelli, and so do you.

133
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:13,821
Otherwise, he walks.

134
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:17,830
We'll contact you when
you land in Vegas.

135
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:34,261
How long have you been
working with the f.B.I.?

136
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,433
Since Heidi's accident.

137
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:40,471
I take Linderman down
for a long time, Peter.

138
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:42,733
I thought I could be a hero,
save the world.

139
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:45,650
- Instead I just killed--
- What's that?

140
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:47,771
That's not your blood, is it ?

141
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:50,902
No, Simone.

142
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,451
Isaac shot her. She's dead.

143
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,570
She's dead ?

144
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:01,371
- Did you call the police?
- No.

145
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:03,001
Okay.

146
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:04,710
Here's what's going to happen.

147
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,842
I'm gonna make an anonymous phone call,
okay ?

148
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:10,303
- You will have absolutely nothing to do with it.
- But I did.

149
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:12,303
She's dead because of me.

150
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,053
I don't know what to do.

151
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,222
That's it,
you don't do anything.

152
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,642
Do you understand?

153
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:24,730
This is not the time for
you to get noble, okay.

154
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:26,193
Just stay with me.

155
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:29,061
I can't. I can't.

156
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,693
As long as I'm alive,
everyone around me is in danger.

157
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:43,792
Suresh. We can call Suresh,
okay ?

158
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:45,830
He can study you. He can...

159
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,581
He's working on a cure.

160
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:50,000
It's already too late for that.

161
00:09:54,347 --> 00:09:56,473
Sir. You have your
flight to vegas

162
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:58,682
Just, tell the driver to wait.

163
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:06,142
Peter !

164
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:12,441
Well, there you are.

165
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:15,362
Lyle is watching pay per
view in the other room.

166
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,070
I'm going to run to the gym
before there's an ***** line.

167
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,492
I tell you

168
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:23,542
that flood in our basement turned into
a right vacation for this family.

169
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:27,040
Too bad Claire is missing it all
with that cheerleading retreat.

170
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,591
I'm not going to answer that.

171
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,840
I got the dog hotel giving me
hourly updates on Mr. Muggles.

172
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:40,720
- They hate me.
- Sorry. I have to take a trip.

173
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:44,433
- Now ?
- What else ?

174
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,392
You stay here and
take care of Lyle.

175
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,481
I'll be back as soon as I can.

176
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:52,150
- If anyone comes looking for me--
- Stop.

177
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:54,232
Stop. You can't go.

178
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,292
What you are doing ?
Why are you whispering.

179
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,030
Because you told
me to yesterday.

180
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:00,863
I thought you didn't remember.

181
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:04,452
You told me to pretend
that man took my memory.

182
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,202
You took me in the shower.
You told me everything.

183
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:15,461
- I told you ?
- What you really do.

184
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:19,260
Who you work for,
and what happened to Claire.

185
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,512
Do you know where she is ?

186
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,180
- You know I can't remember.
- No.

187
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,852
But you told me you
were protecting her.

188
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:34,441
You said you sent her
away so she'd be safe,

189
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,611
and that if you went after her,

190
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:38,780
I should give you this.

191
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,491
Claire is with friends
don't go after her.

192
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,450
This is my writing !

193
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,081
Okay, look.
We can't let anybody know about this.

194
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:54,131
Don't worry.
I know how to play dumb.

195
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,422
I can never love you enough.

196
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,921
You do fine.

197
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:06,103
Puccini ?

198
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:08,890
I thought of you more
as a John Denver type.

199
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:11,311
That's your wife ?

200
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:15,730
Your painter friend from new
york has trying to reach you.

201
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:17,691
I chatted with him for you.

202
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,283
Apparently, he's got
himself a dead girlfriend.

203
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:21,493
Nice guy.

204
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,453
Thomson doesn't need me on this one.
I need to be here with my family.

205
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,582
This isn't a request.
This is an assignment.

206
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,463
You do remember assignments,
don't you ?

207
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:35,290
- I'll get my things.
- Yeah.

208
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:46,973
Let me guess.

209
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:51,393
- Another paper emergency.
- Huge order mix up in fresno.

210
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:54,603
Sorry for stealing your husband,
Mrs. Bennett.

211
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,612
It's just he's the best
guy we've got in a pinch.

212
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:02,993
I like your hair.

213
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:10,741
- So this is the list ?
- Yes.

214
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:12,333
What's left of it.

215
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:14,583
Most of these people
are missing or dead.

216
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,923
I want to run your DNA sample
against my father formula.

217
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:19,713
And we can take you
to some place safe.

218
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:22,170
This is your father's formula

219
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:24,172
this is how he made the list,
how he found me.

220
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:26,772
Yes. Although, I haven't figured
out what it he's looking for.

221
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:28,722
Specific gene, codon.

222
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,352
There are 3 billion
options base per human DNA.

223
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:33,181
It's the proverbial needle.

224
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:37,233
- Did my DNA helped ?
- No.

225
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,110
Okay Mohinder,
you've been driving all night.

226
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:42,962
- Why you just don't take a break.
- I can't. These people are in danger.

227
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:44,670
We have to warn them.
If Sylar gets to them first--.

228
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:47,741
Exactly. So let me help.

229
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:53,002
Right here.
This one is in New York.

230
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:55,160
Isaac Mendez. I'll call him.

231
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:59,002
And you just relax
and take a minute.

232
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,550
You're very kind.

233
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:03,762
Thank you.

234
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:07,592
You have no idea how
alone I used to feel.

235
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:10,140
How insignificant.

236
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,180
You've given me hope.

237
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:15,562
Hope is great.

238
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:17,603
We need cafeine.

239
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:21,440
So this formula, if you figure it
out how many of us will you find?

240
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:25,403
Who knows?
Hundreds, thousands, maybe more.

241
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,360
It's busy.

242
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,242
I'll get him later.

243
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:33,540
To new friends.

244
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:40,133
This is good. What is it?

245
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:41,463
Chi.

246
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,840
It's a special blend my
father brought from India.

247
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,802
Who we gonna call next ?

248
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:52,470
No one.

249
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:57,270
I already have you. Mr. Sylar.

250
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:23,750
Here.

251
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,713
Mr. Petrelli ?

252
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:30,382
- Flying man!
- Not here.

253
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,062
- Flying man !
- Yeah.

254
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:42,603
Let me guess.

255
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:45,200
You're still trying to still
that sword from Mr. Linderman?

256
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,070
- Where is your friend ?
- Ando ?

257
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:50,033
I sent him back to Japan.

258
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,611
This mission getting
too dangerous for him.

259
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:54,413
I think I know what you mean.

260
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,790
Can't protect everyone.

261
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:59,663
Sometimes it's better
to go it alone.

262
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:01,373
The more people
you try and help,

263
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:03,042
the more people get hurt.

264
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,301
Please, you must help me.

265
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:10,133
I can't get past
the casino security.

266
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:12,382
When I first met you,
I thought you were nuts.

267
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,761
It's okay.
I thought you were mean.

268
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:20,523
But know you know, you pretend
you do not care about anyone,

269
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:22,641
but you care too much.

270
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:28,150
It's really important you
get your powers back, huh ?

271
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:31,201
It is important for everyone.

272
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,861
Follow me.

273
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,281
You know who I am ?

274
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:38,911
Of course. Mr. Petrelli.

275
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:41,502
My friend is making a delivery
for me to Mr. Linderman,

276
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,293
something he's expected.

277
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,173
I didn't realize...

278
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,042
I think you've been
around long enough

279
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:50,552
to know what happens when Mr. Linderman
doesn't get what he's expecting.

280
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,670
Or do I have to
paint you a picture.

281
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,301
You can take it to the curator.

282
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,012
That work for you?

283
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,520
Vivian Louis ?

284
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:02,813
My name is Vivian
and I'm from Canada.

285
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:04,810
Are you kidding me ?

286
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,023
I do not need you happy,
only safe.

287
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,323
There's nothing left of me.

288
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:13,610
Everything I have will disappear
the second I get on the plane.

289
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,703
My friends, my family. Me.

290
00:17:16,998 --> 00:17:19,953
I can make you forget it all,
if that's what you'd prefer.

291
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:22,911
There's nothing left for you here.
No one to trust.

292
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:28,210
No. You cannot see him again.

293
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,612
Peter Petrelli is the only
person I know that I can trust.

294
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:32,302
More than you.

295
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,170
He cares about me.

296
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:36,971
Why can't I hide in
New York with him ?

297
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:40,851
He's not in a position to be
responsible for you or himself.

298
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:42,473
Come.

299
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:45,272
Boarding pass and I.D.

300
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:50,362
Boarding pass and I.D.

301
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:55,650
Boarding pass and I.D.

302
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,202
Sorry, sir, only passengers
are allowed beyond this floor.

303
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:17,513
Isaac Mendez, NYPD.

304
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,931
We have a few
questions for you.

305
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:30,020
Mr. Mendez,
detective Jeff Tracy, NYPD.

306
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,481
Do you know this woman ?
Simone Deveau ?

307
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:34,480
She and I...

308
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,821
We broke up recently.

309
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,950
We received a phone call
that she might be hurt.

310
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,872
Some of your neighbours

311
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:44,952
said they heard an
argument then gunshots.

312
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,082
Might if we take
a look around ?

313
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:53,092
Isaac. What's going on ?

314
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:58,130
Something wrong ?

315
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:03,350
No, ma'am. Apparently not.

316
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:05,021
Sorry for taking your time.

317
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:10,311
Simone, you're alive.

318
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,902
Lucky you.

319
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:15,781
My.

320
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:18,861
You're very usefull.

321
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:29,793
Candace is special,
just like you.

322
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,501
Where's Simone ?

323
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,920
She's traveling
Europe, indefinitely.

324
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:36,260
As far as the rest of
the world is concerned.

325
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:39,262
There's a crew going
to clean up this mess.

326
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:41,682
How am I supposed to
pretend this didn't happen ?

327
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:44,011
Maybe you should have
thought about that

328
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:46,681
before you shot her, twice.

329
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:49,180
What's the matter, sweetie,

330
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,311
you wanna shoot me again ?

331
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:55,861
Enough.

332
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:01,822
I can't stay here.

333
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,202
- Take me with you.
- That's not our assignment.

334
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,702
Please.

335
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,493
- I don't know what to do.
- Of course you do.

336
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:13,132
You keep painting.

337
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:18,840
My condolescences.

338
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,061
There you go.

339
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:40,821
- When did you get so good ?
- I'm unemployed.

340
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,492
What do you this I do all
day when you're at school ?

341
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:47,031
- Wow.
- One more ?

342
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:48,953
I can't.
I'm going to be late for the bus.

343
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,371
So be late !

344
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,502
You're not gonna learn something at
school that you don't already know.

345
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:56,790
Love you.

346
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:06,011
You know,
you have to admit it, Nikki,

347
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:08,510
I do a better you than you.

348
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,521
Did you think I
wouldn't find out ?

349
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:16,652
About what ?

350
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,201
- Where did you get that ?
- It was on my pillow.

351
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:28,200
Well, I didn't put it there.

352
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:31,410
Were you digging
through my stuff ?

353
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:33,332
Don't turn this
around on me, Nikki.

354
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,040
You said no more secrets.

355
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:37,742
I found out you're going to
Linderman's casino. For what ?

356
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,172
- What did you got doing with this guy ?
- It's nothing.

357
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:43,302
Linderman called and he asked
me to be his dealer, that's it.

358
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:45,343
You're not talking about
dealing cards here.

359
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:47,050
That's all this is.

360
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,430
Baby trust me. I promise you,

361
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,102
I won't do anything
that I don't want to.

362
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,850
All right ?

363
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:13,791
You left that for him,
didn't you ?

364
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,673
Cute.

365
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:28,223
- I can't feel my fingers.
- It's the curar.

366
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:30,892
It induces paralysis
of the brain.

367
00:22:31,188 --> 00:22:33,392
Which means you can't
control your abilities.

368
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:37,480
Whoever you think I am,
I'm not.

369
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:40,233
You are the man who
murdered my father !

370
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,363
Do you still expect me to
believe you're Zane Taylor ?

371
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:48,491
Zane was killed three days ago,

372
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:50,701
the same day I met you.

373
00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:55,583
You thought you were so clever,
giving me his DNA.

374
00:22:56,587 --> 00:22:58,120
You're a parasite.

375
00:22:58,506 --> 00:23:01,132
You killed my father
and fed off his work.

376
00:23:03,386 --> 00:23:05,212
Let me here you say it.

377
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,591
Tell me your name.

378
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:07,673
Say it !

379
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,431
Say it !

380
00:23:09,936 --> 00:23:11,602
Sylar !

381
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,811
There's only one thing
to do with a parasite.

382
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:20,693
Kill it before it kills again.

383
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:25,481
You're just like your father,
murderers the both of you.

384
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,193
I'm a scientist.

385
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:31,200
Your father said that.
But he kept bleeding me through--.

386
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:32,871
He had no idea what you were.

387
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,280
He knew.

388
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,340
He might not have admitted it,
but after all,

389
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,680
we were making so much progress
together, why would he stop?

390
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:40,920
You know nothing
about my father.

391
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:42,711
I know everything.

392
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,962
He confided in me.

393
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,471
He told me things he felt
he could never tell you.

394
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,880
Things about your
sister, Shanti.

395
00:23:51,307 --> 00:23:53,181
He thought you were too--

396
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:57,893
what's the word ?
Fragile to know the truth.

397
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,192
That why he let me.

398
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:02,651
You were always
seeking his approval.

399
00:24:02,946 --> 00:24:05,772
I provided stimulation
and he gave up on you,

400
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:10,821
but adored me.
Who is the real parasite here ?

401
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,750
You're right.

402
00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:22,373
My father did want answers.

403
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:25,673
He called you patient 0.

404
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:29,591
You were the template he
used to create this formula.

405
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,722
You're the key to
unlocking its secret.

406
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:35,551
As much as I'd like to,

407
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:38,562
killing you will not
give me what I need.

408
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:41,312
So what are you going to do ?

409
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,061
I'm going to take a sample
of your spinal fluid,

410
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,361
and it's going to hurt !

411
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:52,242
You can at least do some
good before you die.

412
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:32,190
There are so few dead sea
fragments left in the world,

413
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,282
it would be a pity if
you crushed this one.

414
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:36,741
So many things.

415
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:38,743
You brought the new Mendez ?

416
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,291
This one is very special.

417
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,051
This painting is ripped.

418
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,050
And repaired with
a scotch tape.

419
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,761
Yes. Very special.

420
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:00,182
Is there something else?

421
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:05,980
I... need the "shito"
for "tiribari".

422
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,200
Sword, Kensei.

423
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,422
I found you.

424
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:51,270
There are 754 members of the
security team in this hotel,

425
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:53,902
all of them with the
instructions to drop

426
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:58,413
what they're doing and come
running if I push this button.

427
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:06,040
Code 5. Activated.

428
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,002
The sword you
thought you'd steal,

429
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,433
do you even realize what who
you thought it belonged to ?

430
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:13,130
Akeizo Kensei. He was a hero.

431
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,761
Security, sir.

432
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,512
This man tried to steal
from Mr. Linderman.

433
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,561
Ando ! How did you...

434
00:27:25,817 --> 00:27:28,271
I knew you'd set off
an alarm eventually.

435
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,983
I've been following you.

436
00:27:31,906 --> 00:27:35,782
What about the other
753 members of security?

437
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:47,453
The guy says Linderman's
gonna be here.

438
00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:49,120
Asking for me in about an hour.

439
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,930
I'm not in the mood for craps so
I'm going straight to my room.

440
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:54,751
I gues it's hard to act natural
when you are going after the whale.

441
00:27:55,055 --> 00:27:57,380
Maybe he'll chat up a few
more japanese tourists.

442
00:27:57,716 --> 00:27:59,633
Where it hell is that pizza?

443
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:05,680
Hi, agent Alonzo, Casada.

444
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,062
Mr. Linderman
sends his regards.

445
00:28:08,277 --> 00:28:09,732
And a suggestion.

446
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:13,310
Don't run surveillance from
inside a man's own hotel.

447
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,400
It's very tacky.

448
00:28:15,697 --> 00:28:17,150
Kick over your guns.

449
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:21,913
Down.

450
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:27,830
So much easier working
with professionals.

451
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:35,422
I finally found it.

452
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:38,961
That's it,
the four simple genes answer everything.

453
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:42,512
I can make a new list,
I can find them, save them.

454
00:28:43,726 --> 00:28:45,641
And what about me ?

455
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:49,142
Don't I deserve to be saved ?

456
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:56,271
Aren't I just a victim too ?
I didn't ask for this.

457
00:28:57,408 --> 00:28:59,572
And what would you have me do ?

458
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:01,650
Help find a way

459
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:05,530
to give me salvation.

460
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:13,712
Give me that damn list so
I can see my teeth in.

461
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:22,970
I'm a natural
progressively species.

462
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,972
Evolution is a part of nature.

463
00:29:26,358 --> 00:29:28,972
And nature skill kills simple.
Right ?

464
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,313
What you have done is not evolution,
it's murder.

465
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:35,020
What I am doing is revenge.

466
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,481
Now I can fulfill
my duty as a son.

467
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:01,922
I wasn't begging for my life.

468
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:05,682
I was offering you yours.

469
00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:11,273
You are your father's son.

470
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:15,312
So determined you didn't even
noticed I stopped the IV.

471
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:21,901
Don't worry.

472
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:26,450
You might actually do
some good before you die.

473
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:30,491
Starting with that list.

474
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:41,102
I'm back in my room.
I'll be on the floor in an hour.

475
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,451
Wearing this could get a person killed.
Okay, sorry. Easy

476
00:31:57,797 --> 00:31:59,333
Listen to me.

477
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:01,690
I don't know how much time we
have before she comes back.

478
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,252
- Who ?
- Jessica.

479
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,173
The woman they sent after you.

480
00:32:07,098 --> 00:32:11,303
- You pick the wrong day to screw with me.
- Linderman knows about the wire and the F.B.I.

481
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,431
The F.B.I.
can hear everything we're saying.

482
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:17,021
No. They can't. They're dead.

483
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:20,022
Linderman knows
you turned on him.

484
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:24,940
Did you come here to
kill me or warn me?

485
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:26,820
Just trust me.

486
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,242
Well, you're back early.

487
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:33,950
Hey, good news.

488
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:37,162
I convinced the hotel to let us keep Mr.
Muggles in the room.

489
00:32:37,546 --> 00:32:39,502
That is good news.

490
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:46,003
I've been going out of my head,

491
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,801
thinking everybody is watching me,
waiting for me to make a mistake

492
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:50,842
- did you find her ?
- I can't do that.

493
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:53,891
If I know where she is,
they can extract it from me.

494
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:56,020
I need you to be strong
a little while longer.

495
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:58,062
We both have to pretend

496
00:32:58,105 --> 00:33:00,680
that we have no idea what
happened so Claire will be safe.

497
00:33:00,985 --> 00:33:04,520
- But the company...
- Has to be stopped for good.

498
00:33:04,865 --> 00:33:08,573
That's the only way to make sure
that Claire will stay safe.

499
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:16,490
I didn't know that I could
talk to you like this.

500
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:22,410
I always just thought that you be so
furious at me for all the lies
and deceipts.

501
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:25,042
Right now we just have
to take care of Claire.

502
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:27,090
We'll talk about us later.

503
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:29,923
Must be the kennel.

504
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:35,511
Hello.

505
00:33:36,476 --> 00:33:37,800
Yes, it is.

506
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:42,021
Yes. He is going
to be a problem.

507
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,772
Why don't we do it right now ?

508
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:00,161
Sorry.

509
00:34:12,848 --> 00:34:14,221
I did it !

510
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:20,261
Don't worry about me...

511
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:22,141
you must go !

512
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:23,641
You have the sword.

513
00:34:23,985 --> 00:34:26,810
- You can teleport out of here.
- No.

514
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:31,440
- Come, we both go.
- Both ?

515
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,291
Oh no.

516
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,882
This looks like...

517
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:56,593
What happened ?

518
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,051
It's the future.

519
00:35:01,606 --> 00:35:03,431
The bomb.

520
00:35:06,027 --> 00:35:07,483
We didn't stop it.

521
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:13,692
I failed.

522
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,723
I am sorry.
I hope I have the right address.

523
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:41,393
I'm looking for Peter Petrelli.

524
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,640
You picked a terrible
time to do that.

525
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:45,972
Peter is not here just now.

526
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:49,983
You may as well come
inside, Claire.

527
00:36:13,427 --> 00:36:14,963
Who are you ?

528
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:16,712
I'm your grandmother,

529
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:18,490
and I've been trying
to protect you,

530
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:20,681
but you haven't made
that very easy.

531
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:22,890
Quite stubborn, aren't you ?

532
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:25,640
Just like your father.

533
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:33,440
Linderman hired her to kill the F.B.I.
and keep you in line.

534
00:36:33,617 --> 00:36:34,821
Who ?

535
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,240
Let's just say I owe her.

536
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,612
He's going to offer you a deal.

537
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:43,781
If you go in there,
you have to take it.

538
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,963
Spend the rest of my life
with his boot on my neck,

539
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,790
- no thank you.
- Then run.

540
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:49,252
Get your family and run.

541
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:51,960
You said you had kids.
Two boys ?

542
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,580
I can't do that.

543
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,463
- You don't have any other option.
- Yeah. I do.

544
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:00,841
I could kill him.

545
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:06,140
- Knock me out.
- Why ?

546
00:37:06,397 --> 00:37:09,313
So Jessica knows she's
not in control anymore.

547
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:12,440
- Who is Jessica ?
- You want this gun ?

548
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:16,820
Do it.

549
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:26,491
Not up there.

550
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:30,453
Mr. Linderman won't be
meeting you in his office.

551
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,813
Mr. Linderman ?

552
00:38:01,248 --> 00:38:05,531
Do you enjoy vegetables, Mr.
Petrelli ?

553
00:38:08,588 --> 00:38:11,501
I've been known to eat
sukini when the mood strikes

554
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:13,713
but not as a rule.

555
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:16,333
You could probably hire
someone to do that for you.

556
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,251
Oh, yeah. I like to cook.
It's my meditation.

557
00:38:19,635 --> 00:38:22,052
One aims for perfection
in one's life,

558
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:24,590
but one doesn't
find it very often.

559
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,132
For me,

560
00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:29,261
this is about as
close it it gets.

561
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,473
Voila. A pot pie.

562
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:35,311
Wholesome, harm, healthy.

563
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,650
That's of course if you can
live without the cream sauce,

564
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:39,113
personally, I can't.

565
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:41,191
I mean, what's the point?

566
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,401
You know,
people can sleep or they can gamble

567
00:38:45,706 --> 00:38:49,532
or they can even make love
when they're miserable.

568
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:54,580
But I think that most people
eat when they're happy.

569
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:56,710
I like to see people happy.

570
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:58,830
Are you happy, Nathan ?

571
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,632
Not especially.

572
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,632
I guess I have a few
issues that plague me.

573
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,721
Oh, dear. Sorry to hear that.

574
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,930
You see,
I think there comes a time

575
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:11,890
when a man as to ask himself

576
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:15,520
whether he wants a life of
happiness or a life of meaning.

577
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:20,521
- I'd like to have both.
- Can't be done.

578
00:39:20,865 --> 00:39:23,151
Two very different paths.

579
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:26,401
I mean, to be truly happy,
a man must live

580
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:29,073
absolutely in the present.

581
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,913
No thought of
what's gone before

582
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,791
and no thought of
what lies ahead.

583
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:34,911
But

584
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,713
a life of meaning,

585
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:41,711
a man is condemned to wallow in the
past and obsess about the future.

586
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,051
My guess is that

587
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:49,223
you have done quite a bit of obsessing
about yours these last few days.

588
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,941
Now, you can't have
any of my pot pie.

589
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:10,201
I want hold it against you.

590
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:12,990
Lots of men have
tried to kill me.

591
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,581
And I'll be the last.

592
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:19,622
Of course you can pull
that trigger Nathan.

593
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:21,793
You'll be taking
both of our lives.

594
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:24,462
You'll be dead within moments.

595
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,920
Or I could offer you something.

596
00:40:29,306 --> 00:40:31,722
I'm not interested in anything
you have to offer me.

597
00:40:31,978 --> 00:40:33,680
I think you are.

598
00:40:34,107 --> 00:40:36,891
I think there are things
you need to hear.

599
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:40,852
- Things that I know about.
- Too late for that.

600
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,480
But you can fly, for instance ?

601
00:40:44,198 --> 00:40:47,572
Or about your brother, Peter ?
Huh ?

602
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,113
And his small problem.

603
00:40:50,536 --> 00:40:52,361
Your daughter, even.

604
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:57,162
Or those others
out there like you.

605
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:08,052
I can offer you more than
just information Nathan.

606
00:41:08,387 --> 00:41:11,720
You're going to win your election,
I'll see to that.

607
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:13,510
And two years from now,

608
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:16,473
through a series of
fluke circumstances

609
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,972
you will find yourself
in the white house,

610
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:21,603
a heartbeat away
from the presidency.

611
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:25,443
A life of meaning, Nathan.

612
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:29,073
Think about it.

613
00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:31,361
The choice is yours.

614
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:49,843
Suresh ?

615
00:41:54,936 --> 00:41:56,091
Suresh ?

616
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:03,393
It's Peter Petrelli.

617
00:42:08,488 --> 00:42:09,862
Mohinder ?

618
00:42:28,258 --> 00:42:30,133
Sylar.

619
00:42:32,556 --> 00:42:34,093
I remember you.

620
00:42:36,225 --> 00:42:38,390
You're like me, aren't you ?

621
00:42:41,146 --> 00:42:43,100
I'd like to see how that works.

622
00:42:45,645 --> 00:42:47,560
No !

623
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:54,530
