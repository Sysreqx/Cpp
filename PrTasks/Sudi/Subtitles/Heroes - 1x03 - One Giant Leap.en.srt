1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:03,420
Previously on Heroes.

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,894
- What happenend?
- You tried to kill yourself.

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,176
You flew up and caught me.

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,220
You jumped.
25 feet to a fire escape.

5
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,734
I climbed up and carried you down,
that's what happened.

6
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,016
The rest is just crazy
talk. Understand?

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:20,437
I spoke to a very nice woman
with the adoption agency.

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,162
She said thery
were going to try

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,441
to get in touch with
your birth parents.

10
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:26,560
You can't protect me forever.

11
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:29,361
I know and it breaks my heart.

12
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:31,111
I love you dad.

13
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:38,280
This is Claire Bennet.

14
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:41,370
It really does break my heart.

15
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:44,163
Please don't hurt me.

16
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,423
You're not supposed
to be in here.

17
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:54,313
I didn't kill these people,
Sylar did.

18
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,262
- You're under arrest.
- What?

19
00:00:57,225 --> 00:01:00,013
Hello. Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:01,680
I love New York.

21
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:14,783
Mr. Isaac Mendez?

22
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:19,160
Mr. Isaac?

23
00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:24,040
We've got a live on here.

24
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:27,463
No English, no passport,
no american money, no ID.

25
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:29,212
How long ago did he do this?

26
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,301
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday.

27
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:33,131
October 2.

28
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:35,171
Ocotber 2? No, pal.

29
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:39,220
Today... November 8.

30
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:13,551
Chapter Three
One giant leap.

31
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:27,520
When evolution selects its agents,
it does so at a cost.

32
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:30,352
It makes demands in
exchange for singularity.

33
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:34,401
And you may be asked to do
something against your very nature.

34
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:58,511
Suddenly, the
change in your life

35
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,642
that should have been wonderful,
comes as a betrayal.

36
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:08,392
It may seem cruel,

37
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:11,600
but the goal is nothing
short of self-preservation.

38
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:14,022
Survival.

39
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:26,461
So, if our team wins,
there'll be a celebratory bonfire,

40
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:30,332
where I need to represent.
So it might be, like, midnight-ish.

41
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:31,833
On a school night?

42
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,582
A celebratory school night.

43
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:40,920
- So, is that the quarterback?
- Who?

44
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:43,143
The boy that you like,
right over there.

45
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,352
I don't like him.

46
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:48,313
I mean,
he's a very nice boy, but--

47
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,520
Yes, he's the quarterback.

48
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:53,691
If you really wanted to make me happy,
you'd only date nerds.

49
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:56,243
Well, it worked out very
well for your mother.

50
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:00,610
- I love your glasses, Mr. Bennet.
- Thank you, Jackie.

51
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:02,740
Rumor has it you're
a local hero.

52
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:04,860
Pulled a man out of
a burning train car.

53
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:08,371
You heard about that?
O.M.G., does everybody know?

54
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,471
It was on the news. You told half
the school to set their TiVos.

55
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:14,472
It's going to be the cornerstone of
my campaign for class president.

56
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:16,472
I'm running on a platform
of moral, mental,

57
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:20,553
and social advancement through
good deeds. What do you think?

58
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:26,143
I think I need to get
something out of my locker.

59
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:26,853
Hey.

60
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:33,643
Claire.

61
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:38,570
Be careful. Okay?

62
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,620
Where have you been
tje last two days?

63
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,750
I teleported myself
in the future!

64
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:55,223
Haven't we been over all this?

65
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:56,921
Then explain this.

66
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:00,003
It tells the whole story
of my heroic journey.

67
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:02,633
Is this how you
spend your time?

68
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:04,551
Read it!

69
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:10,101
I'm on the subway in Japan.

70
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,392
Suddenly, I'm in New York!
Five weeks in the future!

71
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:16,192
Been hitting the sake?

72
00:05:16,277 --> 00:05:21,530
I found the book's author,
but he was dead!

73
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:24,071
Then, there's a
nuclear explosion.

74
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:27,110
It all happens in five weeks...

75
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,122
and you and I have to stop it.

76
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,203
Definitely the sake.

77
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:38,833
Look, you're in it too!

78
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:48,091
How could I know you
were going to say that?

79
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:51,563
We have work to do.
If you still work here.

80
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:55,640
Listen, if I cn prove to you

81
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,523
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

82
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,651
Will you come with me?

83
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:04,151
We have to go right now!

84
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:07,033
A girl's life depends on us!

85
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:23,332
It'll work. We'll have the
fundraiser here, not the ballroom.

86
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:25,113
Makes me look
fiscally responsible.

87
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:27,502
- Yes, it does.
- Pete, just the man I want to see.

88
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:29,922
- I need to talk to you.
- What do you think? Red or blue?

89
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,112
I don't know. Blue?

90
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:35,330
I'm gonna wear red.
The president wears red.

91
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:36,883
So you gonna come tonight?

92
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,631
Gonna break out the suit,
have a couple of drinks.

93
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,761
Rebuff the advances of
my cute interns? Emily.

94
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:44,001
Yeah, I'm gonna be there.
Listen, I tried it again.

95
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:44,920
Tried what?

96
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:47,221
What do you mean what?
What do you think that I mean?

97
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:48,591
I tried to fly.

98
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:51,133
Would you keep your voice down?

99
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:52,980
You  were there.
Last night I could fly.

100
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:55,681
This morning, nothing.
I nearly broke my neck trying.

101
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,442
Well, it would have solved 
one of our problems.

102
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,702
So I went to the library to see if I
could find anything on human flight.

103
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:02,693
I came across this
amazing book.

104
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:04,813
Listen to this.

105
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,233
"Genes determine obesity,
blood pressure.

106
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:09,081
"Out of the 30
billion possibilities

107
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:11,413
one might contain the
poial for human flight."

108
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,491
This guy knows what's going on.

109
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:14,992
Chandra Suresh.

110
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:17,052
He's a genetics professor in India.
I called.

111
00:08:17,088 --> 00:08:19,751
They  said that he
quit six months ago.

112
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,963
They think he's here in New York.
We gotta find this guy.

113
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,721
We've got a more
immediate problem here.

114
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,630
- What?
- It's this woman reporter.

115
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,892
She's poking around into
why you jumped off the roof.

116
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,690
Look, Nathan, we flew.
Aren't you curious how this happened?

117
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:34,060
Yeah, I mean, I want answers,
just like everyone else.

118
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,440
I mean, just like you, okay?

119
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:37,482
But right now, today, I'm trying to
find a way to put a spin on this

120
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,651
so it doesn't look like
crazy runs in our family.

121
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,033
I need to figure out why this
is happening to me. To us.

122
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,522
Responsibilities, Pete, okay?

123
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,101
I've got a election to and
a family to feed, okay?

124
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:48,822
You are so--
What do you wanto tell that reporter?

125
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:53,200
I know one thing we can't tell her.
The truth.

126
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:13,670
Sorry. I still have
your dad's keys.

127
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:15,933
Maybe I shouldn't.

128
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:20,430
Sorry. After being attacked,
every noise I hear--

129
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:21,562
Sorry.

130
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:25,193
Well, this is
macaroni and cheese.

131
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:28,481
It's what Americans eat when they
want to commit suicide slowly.

132
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:31,282
Your dad said mine was
the best he ever had,

133
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,441
but he was from India, so--

134
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:35,532
Thank you. You're very kind.

135
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,830
You look like hell.
When was the last time you slept?

136
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:45,002
All this work. I'm no closer to
understanding my father's research.

137
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,051
Well, what about the program
on your dad's computer?

138
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,043
Didn't you say he
cracked some code?

139
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:53,012
I thought he had.
But the algorithm... It's gibberish.

140
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,093
Know anybody who
speaks gibberish?

141
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,721
The man with the
horned-rim glasses.

142
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,360
He chased me around the world--

143
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:06,390
Madras, Manhattan, this very apartment--
looking for it.

144
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:08,731
But this isn't anything.

145
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:10,831
Well, then,
why would he build it?

146
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:11,520
Why?

147
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:13,721
It was always this
way with my father.

148
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,820
Every question met with another
question. Never an answer.

149
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:20,742
Only "why?" Even
after he's dead.

150
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:23,333
- Well, what about the map?
- The map.

151
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:27,212
The map is nothing until I can
decipher the principle behind it.

152
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:29,141
You know,
if I could find even one such person,

153
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:32,542
it would validate
everything he believed.

154
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:34,341
But I can't.

155
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,051
Your father had a
lot of faith in you.

156
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:40,091
My father only cared about
proving he was right.

157
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,893
He left his country, his family,
chasing this insanity.

158
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:47,483
And now I'm wasting my life
trying to prove him sane.

159
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:50,352
-  Where did it get me?
- Mohinder!

160
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:56,242
I'm sorry. I'm just so tired.

161
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:14,962
"Sylar."

162
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:20,512
What is it?

163
00:11:21,395 --> 00:11:23,142
Yet another question.

164
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,523
I don't know how else
to explain this.

165
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,861
I heard a little
girl call for help.

166
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:35,992
I went to her.
That's all that happened.

167
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,572
So you just waltzed right in,
found a kid hiding in a wall,

168
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,501
then pulled the name
Sylar out of your ass,

169
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,580
when only a handful
of us know that name.

170
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,581
It's like--

171
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,001
It was like someone
was talking to me.

172
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:49,543
Except it was in my head.

173
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,790
Did the voices tell
you anything else?

174
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:56,252
They want you to do things?
Rob a store, kill the president?

175
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:57,212
No.

176
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:00,590
It's more like I can...

177
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:05,553
hear people's thoughts.
Or something. I don't know.

178
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,063
Can you tell me
what I'm thinking?

179
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:15,363
No, I really can't control this.
It just sort of happens.

180
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,982
Give it a shot, Carnac.
I'm wide open.

181
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,201
You think I'm nuts. Or stupid.

182
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:26,123
Great trick.
Stop wasting my time.

183
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:34,963
Come on, Parkman,
I need this more than you do.

184
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,921
- Nobody believes in me.
- Nobody believes in you.

185
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:42,421
I know what that's like.

186
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:52,520
How much longer do I
have to be in here?

187
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:54,143
Depends.

188
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:59,733
How'd you like to
work with the FBI?

189
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,780
Claire. What are you doing
running off to an away game?

190
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:14,080
That tape with all your attempts
at bodily harm is still missing.

191
00:13:14,215 --> 00:13:16,093
Yeah, well if someone finds it,
we'll just tell 'em

192
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:18,850
you're some visual effects geek
who did it with his computer.

193
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:20,833
Now, can I get back
to my life, please?

194
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:23,881
So that's it?
You're just gonna go pump your pom-poms,

195
00:13:23,975 --> 00:13:26,062
and pretend you're no different
than any other girl on the squad?

196
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:27,262
Yes, actually.

197
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:31,220
But you are, Claire.
You are different. Don't you see that?

198
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:32,992
Don't you see that
none of this matters?

199
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:34,601
School spirit doesn't matter.

200
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:37,861
Being a pretty blonde
cheerleader doesn't matter.

201
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,111
- It's not who you are anymore.
- Who am I?

202
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:44,570
So what,
I can crawl through a wood chipper,

203
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,952
and live to tell about it.

204
00:13:46,077 --> 00:13:48,992
That narrows my choices in
life to freak or guinea pig.

205
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,953
In most cases, both.

206
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,830
What's wrong with
wanting to be normal?

207
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:55,123
You should try it.

208
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:10,262
What are you doing here?

209
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,890
The door was open.

210
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,310
Isaac, you have to get back to work.
Your editor--

211
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,560
The comic book is late.

212
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:20,690
You were taking them,
weren't you?

213
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,411
Yes, I'm going to sell
them in my gallery.

214
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:24,411
And with the money,
we can get you straightened out.

215
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,613
Into rehab.

216
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,362
I'm not going into rehab.

217
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,160
I found all your junk.

218
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,202
The drugs, all of it.
I flushed everything.

219
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:35,922
How am I supposed to
paint the future?

220
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:38,432
Nobody can paint the future.
That's the drugs talking.

221
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:40,420
Look around you at
all these paintings!

222
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:43,090
Every one of them
has come true.

223
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:44,092
Oh.

224
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:45,812
And does that include this

225
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,303
big one on the floor of
New York going nuclear?

226
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:49,720
Yes.

227
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:54,353
I don't know how,
I don't know when, but--

228
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:58,273
I have to stop it.

229
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:05,032
I don't want to
lose you, Simone.

230
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:10,450
But if you don't believe in me,
then you shouldn't be here.

231
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:18,370
Fine.

232
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,673
You think you can 
paint the future.

233
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:24,552
Paint one without me in it.

234
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,510
Hello?

235
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:38,933
I can't understand a
word you're saying.

236
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:42,980
Stop calling me here. You've got
the wrong number. Wrong number.

237
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,241
Who are you calling?

238
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:50,740
The comic book author,.

239
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,032
To warn him about the future.

240
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:54,743
He keeps hanging up on me.

241
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:56,622
Thet's  because you're crazy.

242
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,453
I'd hang up on you
too if I could.

243
00:15:58,545 --> 00:15:59,713
This is the spot!

244
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:05,850
A young girl dressed
in a school uniform...

245
00:16:05,908 --> 00:16:08,800
will step in front
of a speeding truc.

246
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,590
And we have to save her. See?

247
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:12,933
What school girl?

248
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,430
Okay. Which one is she?

249
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:21,690
I don't know.

250
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:26,361
She has a red bow in her hair!
I'll go this ay, you go that way.

251
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:51,631
Ando! Stop that truck!

252
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:58,893
Stop, watch out!

253
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:27,170
I did it!

254
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,382
You did it!

255
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:39,433
So you believe me now?
You'll come with me?

256
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:22,390
- Hi.
- Hi.

257
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:25,350
- How'd you sleep?
- Good.

258
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:27,520
Where are we?

259
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:32,730
On our way to Grandma's house.

260
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,163
Micah!

261
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:49,213
Grandma.

262
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:53,710
- Oh, my. You've grown.
- You always say that.

263
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,551
- I do.
- Yes, you do.

264
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:57,932
Why don't you go on inside?

265
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:03,012
You look thin.

266
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:07,360
Look, I know what it's like
to raise a boy on your own.

267
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,543
To be stretched so far,

268
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,440
you wish you could be in two
places at once. I get it.

269
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:14,940
But that boy needs more than
you've been giving him.

270
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,212
He  needs a steady hand
and a stable environment.

271
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:18,530
I can give him that.

272
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,373
Why, because D.L.
grew up to be such a model citizen?

273
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:28,542
My son, your husband,
is a good man.

274
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:34,290
You recognize this?
I found it in the desert.

275
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:36,340
What's that supposed to be?

276
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:40,511
This belonged to one of the
men that your son murdered.

277
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:42,930
I took it out of the grave.

278
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,602
You know that all of
D.L.'s crew wore these.

279
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,683
D.L. wouldn't murder anybody.

280
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:51,143
- Ever.
- Wrong.

281
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:53,720
He robbed Linderman and
got away with $2 million,

282
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:56,533
- and then he killed his crew.
- My son was framed.

283
00:19:57,075 --> 00:20:00,743
And he'd be rotting in some
prison if he hadn't escaped.

284
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,662
Besides, if D.L.
had $2 million...

285
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:07,291
Honey, he'd be on some
tropical island someplace,

286
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,710
sitting out his years,
with Micah.

287
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,343
I want you out of
my son's life.

288
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,752
Yeah, well,
people in hell want ice water.

289
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:19,802
It doesn't mean they're
going to get it.

290
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:23,342
Paulette, you have no idea
what I am capable of.

291
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:36,201
You want to tell me
why I'm still here,

292
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,831
or am I just gonna
follow you around?

293
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,661
I need you to talk to her.
Find out what she knows.

294
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,201
- Talk to who?
- Molly Walker.

295
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:42,622
The little girl you found.

296
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:44,293
We're keeping her here,
where it's safe,

297
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,500
until we can figure out
what to do with her.

298
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,172
She's been through
a severe trauma.

299
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,011
Both parents murdered
right in front of her.

300
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,803
She hasn't said a word
since we brought her here.

301
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:52,380
What makes you think
she's gonna talk to me?

302
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,930
Well, if you're really a mind reader,
she won't need to.

303
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:56,713
Who is this Sylar?
What's he doing?

304
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,590
We've pieced a trail
across a dozen states.

305
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:02,972
All people impaled by household objects.
Bones broken.

306
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:05,602
All without any traceable
sign of physical contact.

307
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:08,533
But only some of them involve any
mutilation of the head or neck,

308
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,190
so they don't see
the connections.

309
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,641
You think it's all him.

310
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:15,700
I think it's gonna get a lot worse
if someone doesn't go after him.

311
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:18,020
Mr. Sylar? Hello?

312
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:24,992
What are you actually gonna
do if Sylar's in there?

313
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,572
If Sylar killed my father,
I need to know why.

314
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:33,040
I suppose that would
have been too easy.

315
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,080
Let's go.

316
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:36,511
No, all the answers could
be behind this door.

317
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:39,382
It's locked, and I'm kinda
trying not to freak out now.

318
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,263
So can we please just go?

319
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:44,972
Or we could just break in.

320
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:30,513
A little light
reading before bed.

321
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:55,501
Oh, my God.

322
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:03,503
That map, those strings-- 
It's exactly like your father's.

323
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:07,173
Not exactly. This map has more of them.
Dozens more.

324
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:13,313
I know that guy.
He's running for Congress.

325
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:18,853
- His life may be in danger.
- Okay, can we please go now?

326
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:21,101
- Not yet.
- Mohinder--

327
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:38,503
Dear God.
What was my father involved with?

328
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:45,840
We're keeping her in
a safe room down here.

329
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:50,553
It's him. It's Sylar.

330
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,600
F reeze!

331
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:09,441
Hey. Hey, remember me?

332
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:13,823
It's okay. It's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you, honey.

333
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:16,490
How could he find me?

334
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,301
That doesn't matter.
That doesn't matter.

335
00:24:18,405 --> 00:24:20,873
You're safe now. You're safe.

336
00:24:21,258 --> 00:24:23,501
All right. All right.

337
00:24:34,898 --> 00:24:36,470
Show me your hands!

338
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,981
Do it or I'll put you down!

339
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:57,280
You okay?

340
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,013
I'm confused.

341
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,520
You said you called me when
you went in the future.

342
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,773
Yeah. So?

343
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:25,602
So, shouldn't I be at home...

344
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,113
waiting for your call.

345
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,690
We're changing the future.

346
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:34,703
By taking action we've
changed soemthing.

347
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:36,533
What if we make it worse?

348
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:38,843
And if there's going to
be a nuclear explosion...

349
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,043
Shouldn't we be flying
away from the bomb?

350
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:44,253
A hero doesn't run
away from his destiny.

351
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,753
My only concern is...

352
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:52,382
whether I need to hide
my true identity.

353
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:55,430
Perhaps a costume?

354
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:58,393
You even mention tights and a cape,
I'm going home.

355
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,600
You can't go home.

356
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:02,243
The comic book says we fly together,
so we fly together.

357
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:04,520
Does it say we
have to fly coach?

358
00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:21,991
- Simone.
- Oh, hey.

359
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,581
I was just coming up
to check on my dad.

360
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:28,051
Where are you going?
Aren't you supposed to be on your shift?

361
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,143
I was just filling in my replacement,
and saying bye to your dad.

362
00:26:31,178 --> 00:26:31,921
What?

363
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:35,133
- Come here a second.
- No.

364
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,183
- I'm quitting.
- Why?

365
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:39,930
I called the agency and
told them this morning.

366
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:44,811
But my father-- Caroline's
gonna take really great care--

367
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:46,021
But she's not you.

368
00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:49,242
This is not where
I'm supposed to be.

369
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:53,402
It's not what I'm supposed to do.
I can't really explain it.

370
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,320
Well, try.

371
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,880
Look, the truth is,
I've been trying to save the world,

372
00:26:58,915 --> 00:27:02,740
one person at a time but I'm
meant for something bigger.

373
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,751
Something important.
I know it now.

374
00:27:05,877 --> 00:27:10,422
That's really all
I can tell you.

375
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:20,680
I'll miss you.

376
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:25,393
It's New York.

377
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:28,561
Everyone runs into each
other sooner or later.

378
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:31,902
Maybe it'll be sooner.

379
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:41,323
Flames were everywhere.

380
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:43,780
Oh, my God,
I could hear the poor man

381
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:46,753
coughing somewhere
inside the train car.

382
00:27:46,836 --> 00:27:50,540
But there was smoke everywhere.
I couldn't see him.

383
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:53,292
I was so scared, you guys.
I was really scared.

384
00:27:57,975 --> 00:27:59,592
Nice effigy.

385
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,643
Thanks.

386
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,061
I stayed up all night
stuffing it with newspaper.

387
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:07,950
I would have filled his
head with firecrackers,

388
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,523
but that's just me.

389
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:12,351
- That would have been cool.
- Careful.

390
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:15,042
If you stand too close,
you'll end up like that guy.

391
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:18,402
I'm not as flammable as he is.

392
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:21,992
Dale Ledgerwood's got a keg
in the back of his truck.

393
00:28:25,338 --> 00:28:26,740
Are you sure this is okay?

394
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:29,020
We're 30 miles from home.
Who's gonna know?

395
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:33,332
Jackie told me you wanna
meet your real mom and dad.

396
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,172
I told Jackie that
in confidence.

397
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:40,552
You do realize you were
talking to Jackie, right?

398
00:28:41,348 --> 00:28:43,050
Is that why you're bummed?

399
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:44,642
The whole adoption thing?

400
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:47,223
I mean, you didn't,
like just find out, did you?

401
00:28:47,355 --> 00:28:50,432
Oh, no, no, no.
They told me when I was really little.

402
00:28:51,317 --> 00:28:53,600
Why do you think I'm bummed?

403
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:55,811
You don't seem like yourself.

404
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:57,942
Thought maybe
something was wrong.

405
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:01,810
You don't know me well enough to
know when I'm not being myself.

406
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,032
You never drink plain milk.
It's always chocolate.

407
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:08,163
You draw mermaids in the
margins of your notebook.

408
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,973
Put crackers in your sandwiches
to make them crunch.

409
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:13,871
And you're usually the first
person to laugh at a joke.

410
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:17,343
But I haven't heard
you laugh in a while.

411
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:21,262
Lately you seem sort of sad.

412
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:25,142
Have you been spying on me?

413
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:29,933
Claire, my goal tonight
is to hear you laugh.

414
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:42,280
Did you put firecrackers in his head,
just for me?

415
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:09,060
Hey, you waited up for me.

416
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:14,503
Look, I know I missed
our therapy session.

417
00:30:14,918 --> 00:30:16,791
- It's fine.
- No, it wasn't.

418
00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:19,631
I'm sorry. I was supposed to call you,
and I meant to.

419
00:30:19,748 --> 00:30:21,712
I had the craziest day today.

420
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:23,541
You would not believe
what happened to me.

421
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:25,603
It was so strange,
and it was amazing and--

422
00:30:25,636 --> 00:30:27,480
I don't even know
how to describe it.

423
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:29,830
Then don't.

424
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:35,863
That's it? That's it?
You waited up all this time

425
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,892
so that you could tell me that
you don't want to talk to me?

426
00:30:37,925 --> 00:30:39,713
Look, I really don't want
this to turn into a fight.

427
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,661
And if I say anything else,
it will.

428
00:30:42,266 --> 00:30:43,850
I'm really trying, Matt.

429
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,051
You know, this marriage may
not mean anything to you--

430
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:49,001
What? It does. Of course it does.
What are you talking about?

431
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,082
I have a lot of stuff
going on right now.

432
00:30:51,187 --> 00:30:52,492
So do I.

433
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:55,590
It was supposed to be a good
thing when I made associate,

434
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:57,622
and you were suppose
to be happy for me.

435
00:30:57,728 --> 00:30:59,510
But ever since,
it's like you're mad at me

436
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:02,360
for getting what I wanted,
because you haven't.

437
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,610
I don't mean to be.

438
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:23,501
It's just-- It's hard.

439
00:31:25,306 --> 00:31:27,222
I can't do this anymore.

440
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:29,611
I wish he would just leave.

441
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:34,221
Fine. I will.

442
00:31:56,885 --> 00:32:00,082
Wait. Let's take
a little break.

443
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,102
Want to go back to the party?

444
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:04,173
No, I just--

445
00:32:04,317 --> 00:32:08,021
I'm going through something and I
don't know if now's the right time.

446
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:12,651
You know what?
You just need to relax.

447
00:32:14,547 --> 00:32:16,472
What's gotten into you?

448
00:32:16,656 --> 00:32:19,850
I just really like you, Claire.
Don't you like me?

449
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:23,481
No, Brody, stop.

450
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:26,631
Don't hurt yourself.

451
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:31,312
- No, stop it!
- No!

452
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:39,371
Don't be a bitch.
Let it happen!

453
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,290
Claire.

454
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:51,891
Claire!

455
00:33:06,716 --> 00:33:09,201
You haven't said a word
the whole way home.

456
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:16,890
Boy, that has got to be a record.
Are you hungry?

457
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,583
You know, I was thinking that

458
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:20,752
we could stop by that ice
cream shop on the way home.

459
00:33:20,788 --> 00:33:23,430
You know, the one with those
ginormous banana splits?

460
00:33:23,546 --> 00:33:25,702
Why don't you believe
that Dad's innocent?

461
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,901
I mean,
you should be trying to help him.

462
00:33:28,045 --> 00:33:30,511
I know that you want to
believe in your father.

463
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:32,753
But I know what's best, Micah.

464
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:36,391
They're gonna catch him,
and he's gonna go away for a long time.

465
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:41,230
- They'll never find him.
- How do you know that?

466
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:44,740
Micah, do you know where he is?

467
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,151
It's okay.

468
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:14,111
Is there a problem, Officer?

469
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:17,290
Mr. Linderman wants to see you.

470
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,643
I'm with my son.

471
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:46,650
So I guess sooner
rather than later.

472
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:51,280
- To destiny.
- Mmm.

473
00:34:51,415 --> 00:34:53,950
May we recognize
it when we see it.

474
00:34:54,046 --> 00:34:55,163
To love.

475
00:34:55,255 --> 00:34:58,452
May we stay away from it
when it's no good for us.

476
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:04,883
You know earlier today, when you
were telling me how you'd changed?

477
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:05,562
Yeah.

478
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,800
I noticed it.

479
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:10,831
There's just
something different.

480
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:15,293
It's like a look in your eye.
A confidence.

481
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:18,090
There's something
I should tell you.

482
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:19,781
Something, uh...

483
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:23,550
I didn't think was right to say

484
00:35:23,695 --> 00:35:25,201
when I still worked
for your father.

485
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:30,083
Something I wouldn't have even
said to you two days ago.

486
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:34,460
I've been in love with you

487
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:37,601
since the minute I
first laid eyes on you.

488
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:39,173
Excuse me.

489
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:41,931
Everyone excuse me.

490
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:47,332
I'd like to apologize
about the rain.

491
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:50,542
If you elect me, I promise I'll
try and do something about it.

492
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:52,692
I'd like to welcome
you all here,

493
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:55,742
on behalf of my family,
my entire campaign staff.

494
00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:58,893
I'm sure that you know my
brave wife would be here

495
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:00,913
by my side, were she able.

496
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:03,530
The life-altering event
of my father's death

497
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:07,801
is really what prompted
me to run for Congress.

498
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:13,762
My father hid a deep depression--
an illness, really--

499
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:15,910
up until the day he died.

500
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:20,230
His loving wife, his attentive children,
his loyal friends--

501
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:23,370
we all knew about it,
and yet he suffered alone.

502
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:27,933
As many of you might have read,
my brother Peter had an accident.

503
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:31,692
But what I have kept from
the press thus far is that

504
00:36:32,158 --> 00:36:36,712
Peter barely survived
a suicide attempt.

505
00:36:41,376 --> 00:36:45,550
My first instinct was to
keep his illness hidden.

506
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:47,712
But no one should suffer alone.

507
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:51,213
Because we're all
connected somehow.

508
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:54,831
Everyone in this room.
You, me, everyone in this city.

509
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:57,452
And we need to look
out for each other.

510
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:02,873
- Nissan Versa. Nissan Versa.
- That's a popular choice.

511
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:05,521
Let me check to see if
we still have any left.

512
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,112
- Nissan--
- Hiro.

513
00:37:07,345 --> 00:37:09,921
We've got a connecting
flight leaving for New York.

514
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,612
We're not flying.

515
00:37:11,935 --> 00:37:13,003
Why not?

516
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,671
It says we rent a car.

517
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,920
We drive all the way?

518
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:20,601
Yes, in a Nissan Versa.

519
00:37:21,485 --> 00:37:23,821
Do you know how long
that's going to take?

520
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:26,070
Suppose she doesn't
have that exact car?

521
00:37:26,475 --> 00:37:28,671
You're in luck.
We have one left.

522
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:32,992
It's our destiny.

523
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:53,371
So, where to?

524
00:37:53,517 --> 00:37:54,531
Las Vegas.

525
00:37:56,246 --> 00:37:58,211
It's our destiny.

526
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:06,582
How you doing?

527
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:10,570
Well, I'm, uh--

528
00:38:11,408 --> 00:38:16,760
It's a rhetorical question.
Just say "fine" and order a drink.

529
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:19,820
Uh, fine.
Whatever you got on tap.

530
00:38:25,777 --> 00:38:29,203
Do I have time for another one?

531
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,132
I don't want to go
home to that shrew.

532
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:33,182
She's sucking the
life out of me.

533
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,132
What's he looking at?

534
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:41,050
Barking up the wrong tree, pal.

535
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:49,602
What am I doing here?

536
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:52,921
Am I that desperate?

537
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:58,422
She is diggin' me.
I am in for sure.

538
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:07,983
What if I just disappeared?
Would anybody care?

539
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:12,672
How long would it take
to notice I'm gone?

540
00:39:53,236 --> 00:39:55,432
We were in the apartment.
We saw everything.

541
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:57,132
Wanna tell me what you
were doing in there?

542
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:58,202
Please, just follow me.

543
00:39:58,237 --> 00:40:00,072
I believe this man
Sylar killed my father.

544
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:03,553
He has a list of targets, including
a man who's running for Congress.

545
00:40:26,168 --> 00:40:27,722
He turns around to the
other one and says,

546
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:29,981
"Holy cow, a talking dog."

547
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:32,910
You son of a bitch!

548
00:40:34,897 --> 00:40:36,493
Let him go.

549
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:39,950
Easy, Pete,
that's our mother you're talking about.

550
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:42,142
There was no reporter
on my story!

551
00:40:42,237 --> 00:40:44,301
There would have
been, eventually.

552
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:47,750
I had to take control of things
before something happened.

553
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:54,381
You get it, right?

554
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:57,343
- Yeah, I get it.
- Good man.

555
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:37,933
- You're bleeding.
- What?

556
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:43,562
Look, what Nathan said,
it's not true.

557
00:41:43,657 --> 00:41:46,002
- I didn't try to kill myself.
- I know.

558
00:42:19,658 --> 00:42:23,702
This force, evolution,
is not sentimental.

559
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:25,601
Like the earth itself,

560
00:42:25,698 --> 00:42:29,543
it knows only the hard facts
of life's struggle with death.

561
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,892
All you can do it
hope and trust

562
00:42:31,985 --> 00:42:35,182
that when you've served
its needs faithfully,

563
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:39,072
there may still
remain some glimmer

564
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:41,322
of the life you once knew.

565
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:43,962
Holy--

566
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:48,953
