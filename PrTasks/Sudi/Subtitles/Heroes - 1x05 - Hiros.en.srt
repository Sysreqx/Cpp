Chapter Five - Hiros

2
00:00:05,287 --> 00:00:06,726
When a change comes,

3
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:09,525
some species feel
the urge to migrate.

4
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:11,750
They call it zugunruhe.

5
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:14,628
The pull of the soul
to a far-off place.

6
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:18,934
Following a scent in the wind,
a star in the sky.

7
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:20,806
The ancient message comes,

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,714
calling the kindred to take
flight and to gather together.

9
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:25,693
Only then

10
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:29,080
can they hope to survive
the cruel season to come.

11
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:31,461
Peter Petrelli?

12
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,241
What?

13
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:35,300
Are you doing this?

14
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:37,792
You look different
without the scar.

15
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:41,751
- I don't know you.
- Not yet.

16
00:00:43,157 --> 00:00:46,263
My name is Hiro Nakamura.
I'm from the future.

17
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:47,993
And I have a message for you.

18
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:49,582
I don't have much time.

19
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:51,883
I'm risking a rift
just by coming here.

20
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:53,991
The girl...
You have to save her.

21
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:56,043
- What girl?
- The cheerleader.

22
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:58,782
- It's the only way to prevent it.
- Prevent what?

23
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:00,830
Everything.

24
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:04,292
Listen to me. She must live.

25
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:06,741
The painter, Isaac...
Go to him.

26
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:08,272
He will know.

27
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,961
When I call you,
you must tell me where we meet.

28
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,263
You told me many times
how lost you felt.

29
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:16,733
Before it all started.

30
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:18,833
This...

31
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:20,860
is what you've
been waiting for.

32
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:23,813
Be the one we need.

33
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:27,522
Wait!

34
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:29,693
Save the cheerleader,
save the world!

35
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:30,943
Wait! Hiro!

36
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:32,490
I don't understand!

37
00:01:35,506 --> 00:01:37,342
Hiro! Where are you? I...

38
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:40,523
- I don't understand!
- Peter!

39
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:41,783
Are you all right?

40
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:44,663
The cheerleader.

41
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:49,582
She's got an airway.

42
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:51,971
- She's breathing.
- She's got circulation.

43
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:53,580
I'm fine. I just wanna go home.

44
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:55,213
Looks like she was driving.

45
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:57,150
There was a lot of blood in her mouth.
I don't see anything.

46
00:01:57,188 --> 00:01:58,930
- Is her mother here?
- Claire!

47
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:01,042
Oh, my God. Is she okay?

48
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:02,500
- Your daughter's gonna be fine.
- Does it hurt?

49
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:04,441
- They said you're gonna be okay.
- Oh, I'm fine.

50
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:07,810
- I just wanna go home.
- Sweetie, doctors just wanna
run some tests first.

51
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,700
I'll call your father.
I'll tell him to come.

52
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:11,263
Crazy bitch.

53
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:18,290
Do you have any idea who I am?

54
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,133
Better than even you do.

55
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,661
All right, look,
I'll pay you anything, okay?

56
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:24,021
You name it.

57
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:27,930
We don't want anything. We just need to
know a couple of things. That's all...

58
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:42,720
That was entirely unnecessary.

59
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:47,931
You might as well go
ahead and shoot now.

60
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:50,822
'Cause I'll find you.
And I will kill you.

61
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:52,470
Unlikely, Mr. Petrelli.

62
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:55,921
- I've seen your faces.
- That, I'm afraid,
won't be a problem.

63
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,280
Put him down.

64
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,092
Where is he?

65
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:39,323
What'd you do with
Mr. Petrelli?

66
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:43,003
- Who?
- The guy you slept with.

67
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:44,323
Where is he?

68
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,020
I don't know.

69
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:50,013
I don't know how I got here.

70
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,893
- I have to call my son.
- Don't even think about it.

71
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:53,963
Get dressed.

72
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:57,141
- You're coming with us.
- Leave the lady alone.

73
00:03:57,495 --> 00:03:59,853
If you have a problem,
it's with me.

74
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:02,393
You have a
congressional candidate...

75
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:05,691
- missing from your hotel.
- My team's working on it now.

76
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,452
If you'd like to review
the security tapes with us,

77
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,022
you can come with me.

78
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:13,762
Fine.

79
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,020
Let's go.

80
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:22,313
Admirable work, Ms. Sanders.

81
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,700
Feel free to go home,
secure in your solvency.

82
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:28,013
What did you do to me?

83
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:29,560
As I saw it,

84
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:32,493
a lot of things
were done to you.

85
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:33,962
However,

86
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:35,750
none of them by me.

87
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:37,562
No.

88
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:39,263
I left.

89
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,713
I didn't go through with it.

90
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,673
Mr. Linderman
reviewed the tape.

91
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:45,081
And, needless to say,

92
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:47,492
he was quite pleased
with your performance.

93
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:54,762
Either that's you,

94
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:57,922
or you still owe Mr.
Linderman $50,000.

95
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:02,200
Go home to your son,
Ms. Sanders.

96
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:05,133
And tell him that his
mommy doesn't have to worry

97
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:07,982
about people asking for
their money anymore.

98
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:12,131
I...uh...

99
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:13,732
He  was right there!

100
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:15,632
Then he teleported away?

101
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:20,282
He... he stopped time somehow.

102
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,313
He talked to me.
He knew who I was.

103
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:24,260
He says that we all
meet up... somehow.

104
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:25,980
Sometime in the future,
I guess.

105
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:28,572
Look, it seems crazy,
but I know what I saw.

106
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,493
He said something bad is gonna happen,
but we could stop it.

107
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:33,553
First we have to...

108
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:38,161
save a cheerleader.

109
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:39,882
A cheerleader?

110
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,572
It seems impossible, I know.

111
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:44,461
-  Impossible? It sounds mad.
- Please, just...

112
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:48,051
He said that I have to go
to see Isaac the painter.

113
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:51,853
Okay, he's gonna know what we have to
do. So let's just go back to his loft.

114
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:53,242
If the answer isn't there,

115
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:56,623
I promise that I will drive
you to the airport myself.

116
00:05:56,948 --> 00:05:58,343
You can go back to India

117
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:01,880
and you never have to
hear from me again.

118
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,791
Will you fly me there yourself?

119
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,381
There are no answers.

120
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,283
Go home, Peter.

121
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:25,950
Someone there has to be able
to do something to find him.

122
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:28,782
No! He went out on assignment,

123
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:30,912
and he hasn't checked in since!

124
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:33,121
I...

125
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:39,143
Look, will you just have
Detective McHenry call me.

126
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:49,312
Never mind. He's home.

127
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:53,650
Hey!

128
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:55,741
Where the hell have you been?

129
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:57,413
Do you know how worried I was?

130
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:00,753
I must have drank too much
and passed out on the couch.

131
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,103
Do we have any aspirin?

132
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,612
Uh...you have been
gone for a day.

133
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:07,303
What? That's impossible.

134
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:10,222
No, it isn't, trust me.
I've been awake for every hour of it.

135
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:12,062
And I called the
precinct a dozen times,

136
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,640
and they said that you were
working with the F.B.I.

137
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:21,302
Yeah.

138
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,460
That just started.

139
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:27,361
I was gonna tell you about that,
but, um...

140
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:28,403
But what?

141
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:31,222
Where were you?

142
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:34,721
I was, uh...

143
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:41,730
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

144
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,411
Do you have any idea what
I've just been through?

145
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:47,331
I kept picturing you
in a ditch somewhere.

146
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:49,540
And then every time
the phone would ring,

147
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,170
I'd think it was somebody
calling to tell me that...

148
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,931
I didn't know you
cared that much.

149
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:01,012
I'm your wife. I always care.

150
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,782
I mean...

151
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:09,260
It's good that you do, but, you know,
you've barely spoken to me lately.

152
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:11,530
Except in our therapy
sessions, Janice.

153
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:14,041
What if something
happened to you?

154
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:19,030
You worried about me?

155
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:22,330
That's a good thing.

156
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:41,992
That hurt more than
I thought it would.

157
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:45,750
You bastards!

158
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:48,053
You don't know who
you're messing with!

159
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,950
I  don't think they
can hear you.

160
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,812
Well it makes me feel better!

161
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:01,400
Wow...

162
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:06,653
Good... I'm starving.

163
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:07,882
Shut up,

164
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,293
I'm not talking to you.

165
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,233
Do you think they have waffles?

166
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:19,002
I said I'm not talking to you.

167
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:20,702
I can't believe

168
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:23,101
I got beat up because of you.

169
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:25,210
I've never gotten
beat up before.

170
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:27,223
I got punched too.

171
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,502
Once.

172
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:30,320
They kept kicking me!

173
00:09:32,277 --> 00:09:33,732
My jaw is clicking,

174
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,683
did it used to click?

175
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:39,862
Let's just eat then

176
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:41,543
get the car back, okay?

177
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:45,232
This is all your fault, Hiro.

178
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,211
All you had to do
was stop time,

179
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:48,650
and we would still
have our money.

180
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:49,893
My fault?

181
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,351
We got beat up
because you made us

182
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,173
cheat at gambling.

183
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:56,333
Using my powers
for personal gain.

184
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,091
That's the Dark Side.

185
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:00,640
Not being broke
is the Dark Side?

186
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:02,890
Oh! Waffle! Yahoo!

187
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:06,650
I don't know why I'm
on this stupid trip.

188
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,533
I've told you now
a hundred times.

189
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:09,721
To save the world.

190
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,901
"Save the world!"

191
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:14,043
Don't you ever think
of anything else?

192
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:15,603
All you've done

193
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,682
since you came to
America is complain.

194
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,172
If you're so miserable
here go back to Japan.

195
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:23,252
I'm not miserable here.

196
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,240
I'm miserable with you!

197
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:26,631
Then go.

198
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:28,711
Go gamble and meet girls.

199
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:31,781
Hang out with your internet
stripper without me

200
00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:33,532
if that's what you want.

201
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:34,780
Fine...

202
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:36,340
maybe I will.

203
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:39,342
- Okay then go!
- Okay...

204
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:42,350
- I'm not following you.
- Good!

205
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:45,021
You don't even know
anyone in Las Vegas.

206
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:46,740
You don't know anyone

207
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:48,390
in this country.

208
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:50,280
Yes, I do!

209
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:56,430
I'll probably save
the world faster now.

210
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,420
All right, I get it.

211
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:39,621
A guy in his pajamas. Ha ha.

212
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:42,081
Now, we can all stare
and have a good laugh,

213
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,311
or one of you could lend
me your cell phone.

214
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:54,133
Can I help you?

215
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,180
I'll take one of
those T-shirts.

216
00:11:56,436 --> 00:11:58,430
And a cup of coffee,
while you're at it.

217
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,740
Okay, so two porterhouse steaks,
both medium rare.

218
00:12:02,777 --> 00:12:04,372
And, um,
what sides do you have?

219
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:08,051
You know,
one of everything's great.

220
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:10,571
Cool. Thank you. Bye.

221
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:21,093
Why aren't you at work?

222
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:24,203
You been, uh...

223
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:27,363
you been sleeping next to
me all this time, and I...

224
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,161
I miss you.

225
00:12:32,998 --> 00:12:34,302
But I know...

226
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:36,281
I know you think I'm lazy.

227
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:39,171
And that I don't
know how to listen.

228
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,870
And all I do is...

229
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:47,160
Mope. Well, um...

230
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,051
You know what? That's okay.

231
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:55,392
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I just need to try harder.

232
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,521
I think we both do.

233
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:58,982
Good.

234
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:00,863
'Cause we're calling
in sick today.

235
00:13:00,898 --> 00:13:01,981
- No. No.
- Oh, yeah.

236
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:03,991
I got it all planned out.
Just go get dressed.

237
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:06,460
- I'm dressed!
- No, something nicer.Come on.

238
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:23,443
Can I help you?

239
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,593
Hiro. Hiro Nakamura.

240
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:30,193
- Nathan Petrelli.
- Petrelli. Nathan.

241
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:32,342
-  Very nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

242
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:33,733
Flying man.

243
00:13:34,907 --> 00:13:38,540
Oh... you fly.
I see you. Whhshh!

244
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:40,680
Thank you.

245
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,343
I don't know what
you're talking about.

246
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:48,002
Oh, it's okay. I keep secret.

247
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:52,841
I bend time onto space.

248
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:56,173
Teleport into future.

249
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:58,530
We are both special.

250
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:05,252
All righty, then.

251
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:08,752
Oh, I... I go to New York.

252
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:10,440
I see future.

253
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:13,531
Big boom goes there.

254
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:16,511
Bad for many
people. Boo-khashhh!

255
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:22,671
I can see where that
might be a problem.

256
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:24,043
Don't worry.

257
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:25,453
I stop it.

258
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:27,070
Am hero.

259
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:29,953
Lucky us.

260
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:36,152
Better go.

261
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:45,283
In this future that you see,

262
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:48,892
you don't happen to know whether
or not I win the election, do ya?

263
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,831
Yes, um... Petrelli.

264
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:51,902
Uh-huh. Nathan.

265
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:53,601
Ah, hai, hai, hai!

266
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:56,311
Yes! I know you.
Nathan Petrelli.

267
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:58,380
Election. You win.

268
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:00,962
Very big win. Landslide.

269
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:01,931
Yeah.

270
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:05,843
I  gotta get back to Vegas.

271
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:07,862
Uh, give me ride, please.

272
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:10,122
Hmm?

273
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:12,522
Ride. Boo boo.

274
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:14,582
Sure.

275
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:16,301
Well, what the hell?

276
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:20,123
- What'd you say your name was?
- Hiro Nakamura.

277
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:22,200
- Where you from?
- Tokyo, Japan.

278
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,121
Ah. Never been there.

279
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:32,722
Hi.

280
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:36,350
Your mother told me you
lost control of the car.

281
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,171
That's what I told
her happened.

282
00:15:55,477 --> 00:15:57,683
Is there something
you want to tell me?

283
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:06,462
I ran the car into
the wall on purpose.

284
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:10,112
- You could have killed yourself.
- I wasn't thinking about me.

285
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:12,173
Well, what were
you thinking about?

286
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:15,653
Claire.

287
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,141
You've got to
start trusting me.

288
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:27,493
I lied to you.

289
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,031
About what?

290
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,502
I lied to you when
I said that...

291
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:42,750
I lied to you when I said nothing
happened... at the bonfire.

292
00:16:43,077 --> 00:16:44,503
What happened to you?

293
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:51,791
He tried to...

294
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:57,800
- He tried to force me.
- The quarterback?

295
00:16:58,128 --> 00:16:59,501
He threw me down,

296
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:02,403
and I hit my head,
and I woke up somewhere else.

297
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,333
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:07,721
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I didn't know what else to do.

299
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:10,232
I can't prove anything.

300
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:13,640
He was gonna get
away with it again.

301
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:16,671
I'm not the only one.

302
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:24,792
Please, you can't say anything.

303
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:29,770
No one's gonna know.

304
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:34,861
No one's gonna know a thing.

305
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,340
Hello?

306
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:40,662
Isaac?

307
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:50,711
You doing okay?

308
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:53,913
Go away, man.

309
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:56,590
Isaac, I need your help.

310
00:17:57,738 --> 00:18:02,622
You need help... ask Simone.

311
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,900
You already took her.

312
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:07,443
What else do you want from me?

313
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,492
You painted me.

314
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:12,852
A picture of me flying.

315
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:16,540
Okay, it happened.
It was real. I flew.

316
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:18,151
Congratulations.

317
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:20,440
I'm telling you
that I believe you.

318
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:22,441
That you can paint the future.

319
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,210
So whatever is
happening to you,

320
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,120
it's happening to me too.

321
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:34,683
And I don't know why,
but I'm supposed to... see you.

322
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,690
You're supposed to
have the answer.

323
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:39,553
Is that what, um, I sound like?

324
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,602
No wonder she left me.

325
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:45,091
I don't have any answers.

326
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:46,740
You're supposed to...

327
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,031
know where I have to go.

328
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:50,741
See for yourself.

329
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:34,791
It's her.

330
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:36,923
The  cheerleader.

331
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:44,031
I'll get it.

332
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,193
Thanks.

333
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,540
Vote Petrelli!

334
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:52,893
Early and often.

335
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:59,851
- Oh... up, up, and away.
- Absolutely.

336
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,720
Vroom, vroom!

337
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:13,722
Move! Get out of the way!

338
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:18,853
Whoo hoo!

339
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:26,323
Maybe there're instructions.

340
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,410
It's all English...

341
00:20:35,137 --> 00:20:37,602
Tell Sakamoto I'm back,
and we need to talk.

342
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,123
Yes, sir.

343
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:45,333
Didn't think I'd see you again.

344
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,342
It's all right,
I'm good, I'm good.

345
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:49,303
What the hell did you do to me?

346
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:51,523
I could ask you the same thing.

347
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:55,813
All I know is that I woke up in your
room somehow, and you were gone.

348
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:57,213
All you know?

349
00:20:57,686 --> 00:20:59,913
We had a great dinner,
then you leave.

350
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,192
You come back and attack me.

351
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:04,443
I have one of the best
nights of my entire life.

352
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:06,943
And the next thing you know, somebody's
trying to throw me into a van.

353
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,873
I don't know what
happened last night.

354
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,280
I swear.

355
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:13,590
All I know is that
when I met you,

356
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:16,402
I was trying to be
someone I'm not.

357
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:18,261
And that's not who I wanna be.

358
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:20,850
Who do you wanna be?

359
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:23,250
Someone good.

360
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:26,480
A good mother.

361
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:32,150
Not the person that
I see in the mirror.

362
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:38,103
Look, I don't know how much of last
night was an act and how much was you.

363
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,071
The girl I met,

364
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:43,733
that's the kind of girl you spend
your entire life waiting to meet.

365
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:49,731
Somebody strong, somebody beautiful,
somebody... good.

366
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:55,642
I didn't know they were
gonna do anything to you.

367
00:21:57,636 --> 00:21:59,843
They blackmailed me.

368
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:02,902
Just like they're
gonna blackmail you.

369
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:11,650
They taped us?

370
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:19,031
I'm so sorry.

371
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:25,890
Wow.

372
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:31,357
Is it Christmas?

373
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:32,841
No, no, come here.

374
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:34,503
What is all this?

375
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:39,813
This is the Shiraz from that
great place in the Sonoma Valley.

376
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:41,742
Remember we went there
a million years ago,

377
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:45,111
- and you've been thinking
about going back?
- How do you know that?

378
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:48,280
And, um,
porterhouse steaks from Mickey's

379
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:51,400
that you craved.
And I'm gonna pretend that, uh,

380
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:53,130
that I cooked for you tonight.

381
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,933
Oh, and, uh...

382
00:22:57,968 --> 00:23:01,962
- Wait, I've had that song
in my head for days.
- Oh, I know.

383
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:06,733
I don't know what to say.

384
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:12,181
How about, uh...

385
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:14,343
"Pass the salad."

386
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:23,622
So, who is she?

387
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:26,501
That's nice.

388
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:28,821
What, a guy can't pretend to

389
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:32,350
cook dinner for his wife without
being accused of cheating on her?

390
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:35,820
Well, you were missing for a day,
and now this, and...

391
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:39,770
Okay, sorry.

392
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,023
I thought this was
what you wanted.

393
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:46,570
Everything I could think of...

394
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:48,780
you thought of first.

395
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:52,503
It's our best... date.

396
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:58,010
It's our only date...
we've had in a long time.

397
00:23:58,027 --> 00:23:58,960
I know.

398
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:05,481
Okay, you know what?

399
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:07,382
Let's, um...

400
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:12,200
let's call this the
first of many to come.

401
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:16,381
Why, do you have something
planned for tonight?

402
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:21,003
- Oh, I do now.
- Good.

403
00:24:46,806 --> 00:24:48,131
Hello, Brody.

404
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:51,680
- I'm Claire's father.
- I know who you are.

405
00:24:51,846 --> 00:24:53,650
You're the guy I'm gonna sue.

406
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:56,991
- I'm very sorry about the accident.
- It wasn't an accident.

407
00:24:57,235 --> 00:25:01,123
- What makes you say that?
- Because she crashed my car on purpose.

408
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:02,293
She's a freak!

409
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:04,563
She's... not human.

410
00:25:05,188 --> 00:25:09,120
I'd put more stock in her
humanity than I would in yours.

411
00:25:10,395 --> 00:25:13,851
- You tried to rape my daughter.
- I didn't touch her.

412
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:15,762
Well, it's her word
against yours.

413
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:18,611
And from my perspective,
she's the more reliable witness.

414
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:20,202
You don't know your daughter.

415
00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:23,081
I know her better
than even she does.

416
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:25,591
I don't have to listen to this.

417
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:29,960
Shh.

418
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:35,122
Claire is a very special girl.

419
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:38,890
It's confusing what's happening to her,
and she doesn't need

420
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:43,552
some punk making her life any more
difficult. Do you understand me?

421
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:47,191
I should kill you.

422
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:51,190
But instead,
I'm gonna do you a favor.

423
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:53,510
You already threw
away this life.

424
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:55,492
I'm gonna give you
a second chance.

425
00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:59,032
I'm gonna let you forget all
the terrible things you've done.

426
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:02,203
And maybe this time,
when you wake up in your new life...

427
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:07,581
You'll make something
decent of it.

428
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:10,250
Shh.

429
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,891
Hollow him out.

430
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:25,802
Take everything.

431
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,243
This is amazing.

432
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:55,992
Look, it's telling a story,
like a comic.

433
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:58,250
This girl, she's...

434
00:26:58,487 --> 00:26:59,563
running and...

435
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:01,211
I...

436
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:05,240
Is that me?

437
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:07,432
Why would I paint you?

438
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:11,890
These two guys...

439
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:16,162
I think we're all
trying to help her.

440
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:19,911
Cheerleader.

441
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:23,230
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

442
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:25,053
Yeah, but you painted these.

443
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:26,801
I was high, dog.

444
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:28,752
So what happens next?

445
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:31,430
- Where is she?
- I was high!

446
00:27:32,715 --> 00:27:34,073
I could have been clean.

447
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:36,143
I tore myself apart.

448
00:27:36,168 --> 00:27:37,552
I lost Simone...

449
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:39,303
to try and find an answer.

450
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:41,222
How to stop it.

451
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:43,680
All I got was this garbage.

452
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:45,960
Some cheerleader.

453
00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:49,480
It's nothing.

454
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,432
I've ruined my
life for nothing.

455
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,602
It's not nothing.

456
00:27:57,757 --> 00:27:59,563
Look, don't you get it?

457
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,750
Everything is connected.
We are all connected.

458
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:05,560
If this thing that you painted,
this bomb, is true,

459
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:06,782
we're all dead.

460
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:09,032
These are the key to saving us.

461
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,450
Something's gonna
happen to this girl.

462
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:13,880
We need to know what.

463
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:15,812
You have to finish this. You...

464
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:17,741
You have to finish
the painting.

465
00:28:18,366 --> 00:28:21,162
Even if I wanted to, I can't.
I'm out of drugs.

466
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,872
I'm out of money to buy drugs.

467
00:28:22,985 --> 00:28:25,313
Can't you just finish
it without shooting up?

468
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:28,702
If you got some cash on you, man.
That's another story.

469
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:31,142
We can call it a commission.

470
00:29:00,818 --> 00:29:02,090
I saw it.

471
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,310
What?

472
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:07,831
I saw something in the, uh,

473
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:10,011
in the canvas. A picture.

474
00:29:10,377 --> 00:29:11,693
This painting...

475
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:13,870
I can finish it.

476
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:15,570
You can paint?

477
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:16,992
No.

478
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:19,680
No, I can't. But...

479
00:29:20,918 --> 00:29:22,212
I drew the future

480
00:29:22,556 --> 00:29:24,340
after I saw you the other day.

481
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:26,240
It was only stick
figures, but...

482
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:31,040
It came true.

483
00:30:15,318 --> 00:30:16,613
Hi, Brody.

484
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:21,043
I know you probably don't
wanna see me right now

485
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:23,260
or hear what I have to say.

486
00:30:23,576 --> 00:30:25,341
But I have to say it.

487
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,961
What you did to me...

488
00:30:28,687 --> 00:30:30,341
what you tried to do,

489
00:30:30,826 --> 00:30:32,242
was wrong.

490
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:38,530
But what I did to you was wrong too,
and I'm sorry.

491
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:42,282
I think that everyone deserves a
do-over at least once in their lives.

492
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,370
I... I don't know you.

493
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:47,471
Who are you?

494
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:52,353
Brody, it's me, Claire.

495
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,360
Why do you call me Brody?

496
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:08,962
Micah!

497
00:31:14,777 --> 00:31:15,912
Where's my son?

498
00:31:16,365 --> 00:31:18,372
Micah! Is he...

499
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:21,280
Oh, God.

500
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:25,810
Honey. Honey. What happened?

501
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:27,472
They showed up a few hours ago.

502
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:28,743
They're looking for D.L.

503
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:30,530
I told them you haven't
seen him in months.

504
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:31,821
- Ms. Sanders?
- Uh-huh?

505
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:34,092
- Is this your husband, Miss?
- Yeah.

506
00:31:34,775 --> 00:31:36,112
What's going on with D.L.?

507
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:38,511
Did he try to contact you at
all in the past few days?

508
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:41,062
- My dad didn't do anything.
- Micah...

509
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:43,863
I need you to wait with Tina
for another minute, okay?

510
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:45,941
Ma'am. Your husband was spotted

511
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:48,583
at a convenience store not far
from here about an hour ago.

512
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,560
- He's here?
- No sign of him yet.

513
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:53,562
But we got cars hidden around the
block in case he tries to make contact.

514
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:55,502
D.L.'s been on the
run for six months.

515
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:57,100
Why haven't you caught him?

516
00:31:57,286 --> 00:31:58,960
We had him in
custody two days ago.

517
00:31:58,996 --> 00:32:01,291
He pulled a Houdini,
slipped out of his cuffs.

518
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:03,932
D.L. Hawkins is a killer.

519
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:06,960
He... he has been following me.

520
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:09,663
- Doing things.
- What sort of things?

521
00:32:10,516 --> 00:32:12,451
Look, if he's here,

522
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:13,943
and he wants something,

523
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:16,103
I won't be able to stop him.

524
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,861
- You need to protect us.
- We've got someone coming.

525
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:22,712
- He's headed for the house.
- Get these people safe.

526
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:24,410
He's headed for the back door.

527
00:32:24,606 --> 00:32:26,553
Repeat: cover the back door.

528
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:35,911
Dad.

529
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:42,243
Freeze! Hands up! Hands up!

530
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:47,992
Niki?

531
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,411
Your men are worried about you,
Mr. Petrelli.

532
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:57,542
Are you all right?

533
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:58,911
I'm fine.

534
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:02,153
Though I can't say I'm pleased
with the security situation.

535
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:04,320
You have the hotel's
sincerest apologies.

536
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,051
Consider your stay on us.

537
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,472
If there's anything else you need,
just ask.

538
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:10,163
Actually, uh,

539
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:12,870
I was wondering how
that tape turned out.

540
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:15,920
Consider it a favor
you'll repay one day.

541
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,103
Or what?

542
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:24,920
For a man whose campaign is
founded on sound family values,

543
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:27,642
this could be really
embarrassing for you.

544
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:29,951
Especially considering
your wife.

545
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:35,543
On the other hand, that tape really
isn't worth much unless I win, is it?

546
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:38,420
Why don't you just give
me my four million,

547
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:41,343
and I'll fly back to New
York and put it to good use?

548
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:44,172
Our agreement was two million.
It's rather generous.

549
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:46,010
You know, I thought so too.

550
00:33:46,297 --> 00:33:48,400
And then I thought, "Gee...

551
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,780
it must be pretty important for
Linderman to see me in office

552
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:54,923
if he's willing to go to this
much trouble to keep me in line."

553
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:58,270
$2 million makes me a
candidate in your pocket.

554
00:33:58,617 --> 00:34:02,551
Four million makes
me a congressman.

555
00:34:05,198 --> 00:34:06,670
Oh, that was...

556
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:10,220
Oh. I love you. I love you.

557
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:12,263
It's like you're in my head.

558
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:15,182
It's like... Mmm.

559
00:34:16,146 --> 00:34:17,382
I love you.

560
00:34:19,028 --> 00:34:21,022
- What can I get you?
- Nothing.

561
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:24,702
Just sleep. For a week.

562
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:29,013
Coffee ice cream.

563
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,740
- What?
- You got it.

564
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:33,571
Coffee ice cream coming up.

565
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:55,432
I, um, I skipped lunch.

566
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:07,371
- Is that the same as...
- Here we go.

567
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:10,823
Hey, um... You have aspirin?

568
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:14,522
Thanks.

569
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:17,661
Security cameras won't see me.

570
00:35:19,588 --> 00:35:22,830
- If he makes a move, I'll blow his head off.
- Now let me see...

571
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:26,291
If I eat cookies,
then I'm gonna  have to work out.

572
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:29,462
Clean everything
out of the register.

573
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:33,341
Probably get a couple
hundred in cash too.

574
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:50,951
Hey.

575
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:54,460
Look, I know why you're here.

576
00:35:54,637 --> 00:35:56,432
And I just wanna
say don't do this.

577
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,152
What the hell do you know?

578
00:35:58,468 --> 00:35:59,571
Nothin'.

579
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:01,971
But I'm a cop.

580
00:36:02,197 --> 00:36:04,812
But I am not armed. Okay?

581
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:07,800
I just came in here to get
some ice cream for my wife.

582
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:09,762
But I know what you're
thinking about doing.

583
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:11,612
And I know that you could...

584
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:14,000
pull out the gun that
you've got in there,

585
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:15,562
and you could shoot me.

586
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:18,991
But then you would be throwing
your life away. And for what?

587
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:21,462
A couple of 20s in
the register, huh?

588
00:36:21,697 --> 00:36:23,513
Look, I know you're hurting.

589
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:28,251
But Marie...
is waiting for you.

590
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:29,770
At home, right?

591
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,573
And Vincent's getting
out in a month.

592
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:34,821
All you have to do is just...

593
00:36:35,076 --> 00:36:37,541
take your hand out of
your jacket pocket...

594
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,091
and put the gun down...

595
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:41,053
and get out of here.

596
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:58,623
Oh, my God. Is that a gun?

597
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:01,180
- What's that guy doing?
- No, no, no, no.

598
00:37:01,705 --> 00:37:03,510
- Why does everybody try to rob me?
- No, I'm a cop.

599
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:05,491
You do not look like
a policeman to me.

600
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:08,772
- I can't believe this is happening.
- No, it's okay, I'm a cop.

601
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:10,372
Oh, my God. This is crazy.

602
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:12,670
I've gotta get out of here.
I've got kids.

603
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:14,482
It's okay, I'm a cop.

604
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:16,783
I just wanna get
out of here alive.

605
00:37:21,265 --> 00:37:22,372
Okay!

606
00:37:25,218 --> 00:37:28,262
You're *** the guy from Japan?

607
00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:30,822
He's one of my customers.

608
00:37:31,545 --> 00:37:33,242
I run a web site.

609
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:37,360
How did you find me?

610
00:37:37,598 --> 00:37:39,453
WHOIS database.

611
00:37:39,685 --> 00:37:41,893
You need unlist, maybe.

612
00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:43,361
You shouldn't have come.

613
00:37:43,437 --> 00:37:44,840
I live here.

614
00:37:45,077 --> 00:37:46,892
My kid is in the other room.

615
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:49,960
What did you think
was gonna happen?

616
00:37:50,287 --> 00:37:51,512
I'm sorry.

617
00:37:51,797 --> 00:37:53,841
We chat so much online,
I thought...

618
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:56,510
I thought you maybe help me.

619
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,551
You got the wrong girl.

620
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:11,543
That person that you see on
the Internet, that's not me.

621
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:15,131
You get the difference, right?

622
00:38:16,278 --> 00:38:18,252
Do you understand?

623
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,151
You want us to take
him in for trespassing?

624
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:26,712
Just... let him go home.

625
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:35,660
It was... nice to meet you.

626
00:38:36,085 --> 00:38:37,102
Okay.

627
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:41,850
We'll leave a squad car outside

628
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:44,171
in case your husband decides to show,
Ms. Sanders.

629
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:45,403
Thank you.

630
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:08,481
Hello?

631
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:15,322
I guess...

632
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:17,580
...we call the artist again.

633
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,702
How'd you do that?

634
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,290
I don't know.

635
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:49,243
We have to save her.

636
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:53,551
Ignore it.

637
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:57,953
It's a wrong number. Some Japanese
guy keeps calling, leaving messages.

638
00:41:03,246 --> 00:41:04,261
Hello?

639
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:05,690
Mr. Isaac?

640
00:41:06,276 --> 00:41:07,553
Isaac Mendez?

641
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:08,891
Who is this?

642
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:10,673
Uh...

643
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:13,920
My name is Hiro Nakamura.

644
00:41:16,696 --> 00:41:18,453
My name is Peter Petrelli.

645
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,490
I have a message for you.

646
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:24,171
