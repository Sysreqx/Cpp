1
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:03,259
Previously on Heroes.

2
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,460
All the answers could
be behind this door.

3
00:00:09,315 --> 00:00:12,243
I know that guy.
He's running for Congress.

4
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:14,530
Who was my father
involved with?

5
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:20,707
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Mr. Linderman wants to see you.

6
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:23,210
I've been in love with you

7
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:26,011
since the minute I
first laid eyes on you.

8
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:34,025
So, where to?

9
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:35,583
Las Vegas.

10
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:38,610
It is our destiny.

11
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:42,551
- You're gonna hurt yourself.
- What are you doing? No!

12
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:44,221
This is gonna happen, Claire.

13
00:00:50,203 --> 00:00:51,220
Claire!

14
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,841
Sometimes questions
are more powerful than answers.

15
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:14,280
How is this happening?

16
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:16,141
What are they?

17
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:18,283
Why them and not others?

18
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:19,883
Why now?

19
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:22,192
What does it all mean?

20
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:26,491
Hello.

21
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:28,670
Is this a hospital?

22
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,462
- Am I hurt?
- You're fine.

23
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:33,610
I was at a bar...

24
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:35,450
having a beer.

25
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:39,500
We had to drug you.
I'm sorry about that.

26
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:42,800
What? What's going on?

27
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,540
Please don't get excited, Matt.

28
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:47,101
We're trying to test
your resting rate.

29
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:51,632
- Let me out of here.
- Just... relax.

30
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:54,041
What are you, FBI? Huh?

31
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:56,391
What, are you CIA?

32
00:01:56,645 --> 00:02:00,281
I'm not part of any organization
that has initials.

33
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,843
Listen to me.
Whoever you think I am...

34
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:08,432
believe me, I'm not him.
I'm not-- I'm not anyone.

35
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:10,742
No, that's not true.
You're someone.

36
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:12,402
You're someone very special.

37
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:14,892
Who are you people?

38
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:21,621
Trying to hear my
thoughts, Matt?

39
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:27,651
Not with my friend here.
He's special too.

40
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:38,602
Look, I am st-- I am an LAPD--uhh!
I'm a cop!

41
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,203
Everything you see...

42
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:42,720
by tomorrow, it won't matter.

43
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:48,671
Who's Claire?

44
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,380
You're further along
than we thought.

45
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:57,222
Go deep. Then clean him out.

46
00:02:58,256 --> 00:02:59,460
What does that mean?

47
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,151
What--

48
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:17,523
Did you call the
comic book writer?

49
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,651
I left messages in Japanese.

50
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:22,600
I need to learn how to say...

51
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:24,873
"You are going to
die in five weeks,

52
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,742
then New York will
explode." in English.

53
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:33,622
You are going to die in five weeks,
then New York will explode.

54
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:36,081
I'll teach you how to
say it phonetically.

55
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:42,872
Come on. I'm feeling lucky.

56
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:07,511
I think it's best if
Micah waited outside.

57
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:18,970
Mr. Linderman is willing to forget
your debt in exchange for...

58
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,931
- a favor.
- What kind of a favor?

59
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:24,872
There's a man arriving this
afternoon from New York.

60
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:28,643
A politician who wants some
help from Mr. Linderman.

61
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:31,742
We're looking for a little
insurance on our investment.

62
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:34,123
And you want me to...

63
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,423
I'm not a whore.

64
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:40,790
I think we've
established what you are.

65
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,060
Jane Doe.

66
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,611
Roughly 16 years of age.

67
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:02,132
Pulled out of Red River Creek at
approximately 4 A.M. this morning.

68
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,243
She was naked and
she was dragged,

69
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:08,542
likely in an attempt
to hide the body.

70
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:11,491
Secondary injuries
are post-mortem.

71
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:19,780
Base of skull was punctured
by a broken tree branch.

72
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,590
Appears to be
victim of homicide.

73
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:25,900
Possibly accidental.

74
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:52,352
Oh, my... God.

75
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:04,921
Okay.

76
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:12,810
I love you too.

77
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:15,833
Bye.

78
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:08,503
Claire! I'm making waffles.

79
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:26,962
Internal polling shows a three-point
bump from last night's speech.

80
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:28,402
Now, I say we roll the dice

81
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,650
and hold off before we get
into bed with Linderman.

82
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:31,910
I can handle Linderman.

83
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:34,370
He may have owned my father,
but he doesn't own me.

84
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:35,733
Look, man,
I don't know about this.

85
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,010
It just makes me nervous.

86
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:39,332
It's your job to be nervous.
It's my job to get elected.

87
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:41,720
In order to do that, I need money.
Linderman's $2 million,

88
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:43,810
we can turn eight points into
three and make it a horserace.

89
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:45,440
Mr. Petrelli!

90
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,143
Excuse me, Mr. Petrelli!

91
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:49,442
Mr. Petrelli,
I must speak with you.

92
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:51,940
Find out about this guy.
Thanks for your vote.

93
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:54,542
- Your life may be in danger!
- Back him up.

94
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,931
I believe someone
is targeting you.

95
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,032
Can you be a little
bit more specific?

96
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:01,000
12% of the electorate
strongly opposes me.

97
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:03,480
Does the name Sylar
mean anything to you?

98
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:04,922
I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name.

99
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:07,642
Suresh.  Dr. Suresh.

100
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:09,840
Get rid of him.

101
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:11,801
Sir, I'm gonna take
down your information.

102
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,701
Have you noticed any
changes to your physiology?

103
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:15,333
Something outside
the norm, perhaps?

104
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:16,960
An ability you
didn't have before.

105
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,023
Mind-reading,
spontaneous regeneration.

106
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:22,223
Please, it's very important
that you listen to me.

107
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,282
Keep an eye on this guy. I don't want
this nut job following me to Vegas.

108
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,112
Oh, not a problem.
Have a safe trip.

109
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:30,863
Get him out of here.
I don't want to see his face again.

110
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:34,550
I know. I know! They're all around.
They're all around!

111
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:10,510
-  Last night...
- Mmm.

112
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:12,632
Before we kissed, you, uh...

113
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:16,792
- made a toast.
- To love.

114
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,910
May we stay away from it
when it's no good for us.

115
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:23,463
I was meaning to ask...

116
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:27,462
I wasn't talking
about you. Clearly.

117
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:30,222
I know. It's just...

118
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:33,611
you and Isaac.

119
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:47,712
There's coffee in the kitchen.

120
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:03,831
You think this is one big joke,
don't you, Pete?

121
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:06,672
Your buddy Suresh.

122
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:08,782
He came by my campaign
office this morning.

123
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:10,303
Made a big scene.

124
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:16,001
He's talking about mind-reading
and spontaneous regeneration.

125
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:17,622
- Chandra Suresh.
- Yeah.

126
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:20,513
- How'd he find you?
- You tell me.

127
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:23,050
- Do you think I called him?
- Don't insult me.

128
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:25,221
I've got trained
professionals to do that.

129
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:29,550
- Hey, where's your mugs?
- Hey, uh...

130
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,543
They're in the cabinet

131
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:34,920
with the water stain that
looks like Abraham Lincoln.

132
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:36,691
Okay.

133
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:40,203
Look... Here's some money,
all right?

134
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:44,151
Take it. You want answers, go find 'em.
It's on me.

135
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:46,183
I need you to disappear
for a while, okay?

136
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:47,961
You're becoming a liability.

137
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:58,462
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:01,280
I'm opening a new
show at the gallery,

139
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:03,611
and a lot of crazy
stuff to deal with.

140
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:05,790
Is it Isaac's paintings?

141
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,023
It's Isaac's paintings.

142
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:12,812
It's Isaac. It's his whole "I
can paint the future" thing.

143
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:16,230
What if he can?
Paint the future. I mean...

144
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:18,231
stranger things, right?

145
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:21,231
No, that's about as
strange as it gets.

146
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:26,230
Ah, no, take it.
You can bring it back tonight.

147
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:29,581
Uh, Peter, I...

148
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:32,750
Uh, I don't know what this is.

149
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:34,651
I mean us.

150
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:38,283
I just got out of a two-year
relationship that was very...

151
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,562
destructive.

152
00:11:39,857 --> 00:11:41,602
And here I am
sleeping with the guy

153
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:45,201
who is taking care of my dying father.
And it's a little confusing.

154
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:47,521
I don't wanna be
the rebound guy.

155
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:51,813
I just need time to catch my breath
before you take it away again, okay?

156
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:53,282
Okay.

157
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:59,043
Claire! Breakfast!

158
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:02,662
Would you please tell your daughter
to drag her fanny out of bed.

159
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:06,973
Claire,  drag your fanny
out of bed! Claire!

160
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:13,391
- Dad, I'm not deaf.
- Your mother's making waffles.

161
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,010
- Were you out all night?
- No.

162
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:24,841
Were you with the quarterback?

163
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:28,860
Yeah.

164
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,740
Yeah, it was just
a bunch of us.

165
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,282
It was stupid. I'm sorry.

166
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:39,093
- Honey, you're gonna miss your plane.
- I'll be there in a second.

167
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:41,100
I'm very disappointed in you.

168
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:47,270
Nothing happened.
We played poker. I'm sorry.

169
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:51,541
I love you, Claire.
I just want you to be honest with me.

170
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:56,252
You can tell me anything.
You know that.

171
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:58,450
I know. I love you too.

172
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,860
Don't think you're getting away with
this staying out all night thing.

173
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:15,842
It's gonna be a throw-down
when I get home.

174
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:31,980
What?

175
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:35,000
Mom said to tell you
the waffles are ready.

176
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,332
I'll be there in a sec.

177
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:41,112
Claire. Waffles!

178
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:50,173
I feel like such an ass.

179
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:52,563
I've never been so
humiliated in my life.

180
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:56,083
What did you expect,
him to invite you in for tea?

181
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,361
Oh, this came for you
while you were gone.

182
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,200
It's my father's ashes.

183
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:22,671
You know, I haven't shed a single
tear since my father's death.

184
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:25,381
Not even when I
claimed his body.

185
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:29,071
They showed me three John Does
before they finally found him.

186
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:32,090
My father was misfiled.

187
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:35,202
I'm really, really sorry.

188
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:37,553
And what have I been
trying to prove?

189
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:41,602
I've used these theories--
the map, this Sylar, all of it--

190
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:45,840
just to validate a relationship
that ended a long time ago.

191
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:49,401
I have no business being here.

192
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:53,392
You're just gonna give up?

193
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,392
I'm going home. To Madras.

194
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:01,470
To scatter my father's ashes...

195
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:04,751
and go back to my life and
stop trying to live his.

196
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:16,110
- I'm looking for Chandra Suresh.
- He doesn't live here anymore.

197
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,633
The guys at the Petrelli
campaign gave me this address.

198
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:22,102
They said he came
by this morning?

199
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:31,610
- You Chandra Saresh?
- No. That was my father.

200
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:38,822
Yeah, um... Your father wrote
a book about people with...

201
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:44,792
abilities. I think I
may be one of them.

202
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:56,990
That's enough. Let's go...

203
00:15:57,788 --> 00:15:59,690
Go away. I'm concentrating.

204
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:01,372
Where are your chips?

205
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:02,750
On 26 black.

206
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:07,022
That's it? That's all of our money?
What happened?

207
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:08,933
Shhh! I need to focus!

208
00:16:09,355 --> 00:16:11,473
Get it back! Get it back, now!

209
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,312
Shh. Sir, no more bets!
Step back, please.

210
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,818
I haven't lost it!

211
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:15,970
26 is going to win.

212
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:17,310
You'll see.

213
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:25,042
Winner by 26.

214
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:27,621
I won! I won!

215
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,321
Did you see? I won!

216
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:30,923
Okay. Let's leave now.

217
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:32,403
Thank you.

218
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:33,922
Now? Are you kidding?

219
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:35,223
I'm on a roll!

220
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,452
No. You're not.

221
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:40,042
But I just won. Big.

222
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:41,702
I did it.

223
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,462
I stopped time. Moved the ball.

224
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:45,151
You won because of me.

225
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:47,803
It's horrible.
I'm a terrible person.

226
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,530
But it was our last dollar.

227
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:54,380
It's genius. Do it again!

228
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:56,950
No! It's cheating.

229
00:17:57,258 --> 00:17:59,130
Is Peter Parker cheating...

230
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,751
when he sells pictures
of Spider-Man?

231
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,540
No.

232
00:18:03,856 --> 00:18:05,452
All heroes have a system.

233
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:07,361
This is our system.

234
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:12,340
Let it ride!

235
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:15,221
So...

236
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:19,700
You still looking in the mirror
seeing a you that ain't you?

237
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:21,861
Yep.

238
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:24,972
Hell, I can relate.
It's called getting old.

239
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:27,350
A little Botox would
do us both some good.

240
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:30,851
I've been blacking out.

241
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:35,190
I  wake up...

242
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:41,183
and... things aren't...
like they were.

243
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:45,971
Like the time you woke up with a
couple of dead thugs in your garage?

244
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:47,080
Uh-huh.

245
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:49,862
If you think you had
something to do with that...

246
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:52,210
One of them was torn in half,
I mean--

247
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,442
Okay, then obviously
it wasn't you.

248
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:56,320
But what if it was?

249
00:18:57,626 --> 00:19:00,250
I'm having these...
violent dreams.

250
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:05,320
I mean, really violent.
Where I am tearing people apart.

251
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:10,122
But it's not me.
It's someone else... in me.

252
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,132
With me.

253
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:16,053
- You know what I think?
- What?

254
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:20,242
I think you saw something.
I think you saw something so horrible

255
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:24,123
that it broke a part of you.
I mean, what happened in that garage--

256
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:27,080
Mom? Wanna play Scrabble?

257
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:28,691
Oh, I do.

258
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:32,773
I really do.
But I can't right now.

259
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:34,420
This is our game night.

260
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:37,783
I know. And I'm sorry.

261
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:39,922
But why don't you ask Tina?

262
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:42,002
She reads those romance novels.

263
00:19:42,227 --> 00:19:44,773
I bet she has an
excellent vocabulary.

264
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:48,142
You know what?
I do have an excellent vocabulary.

265
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:51,092
And those no are the only
romance I'm getting these days.

266
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:54,723
I will take that game, and I will
challenge you, little man. You are on.

267
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:58,560
Why can't you just work at home,
like usual?

268
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:03,403
- Because this job is different.
- You've been different.

269
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:05,093
I know I have.

270
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:07,270
Come  here.

271
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:12,370
I'm so sorry.

272
00:20:12,637 --> 00:20:17,590
It has not been fair to you.
But you have been a trouper.

273
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:19,851
But I have things
under control now.

274
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:23,210
And... I'm just gonna
do this one thing,

275
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:26,481
and it's gonna solve a
lot of problems for us.

276
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:29,123
Then you won't be able
to get rid of me.

277
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:32,313
Fine, but it's safer
over the Internet.

278
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:36,620
What?

279
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:40,763
I mean... what you do.
I mean, in the garage.

280
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:44,932
It's just acting.
None of it's for real.

281
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:53,890
They sent a limo.

282
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:58,493
Either he's a crap house
rat as in "crazy as." Or...

283
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,881
he's one of them.

284
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:02,263
All he's really telling me is
that he can't do anything.

285
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,710
Crap house rat.

286
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:07,503
Don't you want to at least follow
the smoke and see if there's a fire?

287
00:21:10,155 --> 00:21:12,910
It was a pleasure to meet you.

288
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:16,472
Um... good luck with
the whole flying thing.

289
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:17,900
Thanks.

290
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:24,482
So... when you're with your brother,
you can fly,

291
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:27,191
- and when you're with the artist--
- Isaac, yeah.

292
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:30,710
Um, I only met him once,
but after, I...

293
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:34,780
- I drew the future.
- And now you don't do either.

294
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:39,011
Maybe I can only do things when
I'm around other people who can...

295
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:40,790
do things.

296
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,370
Did that sound as lame
as I think it did?

297
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:48,030
It sounds like you should
be talking to my father.

298
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:49,660
This was his research,
not mine.

299
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,083
Where is he?
How do I get a hold of him?

300
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:53,650
He's on the table.

301
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,333
I...

302
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:02,503
I'm sorry. But...

303
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:05,841
You believe that this is possible.
You have to, I mean...

304
00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:08,062
You believed it this morning.

305
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:12,040
- What if I prove it to you?
- Then prove it.

306
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:16,432
We'll go see Nathan.
When I'm around him, I can fly.

307
00:22:16,646 --> 00:22:18,050
I've done it before, twice.

308
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,570
Fine. Let's go
see your brother.

309
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:25,410
Wait, um... He's in Vegas.

310
00:22:25,606 --> 00:22:26,920
Of course he is.

311
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:30,530
Then... I'll take
you to Isaac's.

312
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:33,622
But it's... it's complicated.

313
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:35,422
Complicated how?

314
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:39,641
Isaac.

315
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:46,361
Paintings are by the door.

316
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,562
I thought I was buying
the new pieces.

317
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:56,530
I need the new pieces.

318
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:59,021
Because they tell you what's
gonna happen in the future?

319
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:00,860
How much for the old paintings?

320
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:04,152
To tell you the truth, Isaac,
I don't know if I could sell those.

321
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:07,261
So you only like the ones
I painted when I was high.

322
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:11,171
Interesting. You won't
give me an advance?

323
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:14,051
That depends on what you're
gonna do with the money.

324
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:15,861
I need painting supplies.

325
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:21,211
I take you're not talking
about oils and canvas?

326
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:28,283
It was raining last night.
What'd you do, Simone?

327
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:30,120
In the rain?

328
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,512
You followed me?

329
00:23:34,858 --> 00:23:38,851
I drew this seven weeks ago.
I drew him there...

330
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:42,002
and  here,
before I'd ever met the guy.

331
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:47,121
Are you in love with him?

332
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,132
Looks like you're
in love with him.

333
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:51,370
I don't know how
I feel about him.

334
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,222
And I don't know how
I feel about you.

335
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:58,343
So here we are, not knowing
how we feel about each other.

336
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,193
And this entire
city's gonna go...

337
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:04,943
Unless I stop it.

338
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:07,350
You think you can save
us all by shooting up?

339
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:08,890
I can save everybody.

340
00:24:16,137 --> 00:24:18,073
I'm gonna be a hero.

341
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:27,333
Look, you can't say anything.
I'm fine.

342
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:29,160
He was drunk.
It was an accident.

343
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,970
Which part was an accident--
the rape or the murder?

344
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:33,762
It didn't happen.

345
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:36,112
Yeah, because he killed you
before he had the chance.

346
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:37,601
I'm alive!

347
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,880
Yeah, now,
but you weren't on the autopsy table.

348
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,373
Shhhh!

349
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,451
Look, you said you had
a hole in your head.

350
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:45,600
Okay, maybe when they pulled
out whatever was in there,

351
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:48,170
it's when you, like,
rebooted or whatever.

352
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:49,570
I'm not a hard drive.

353
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,541
No, you're little
Miss Miracle Grow.

354
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,261
Don't ever call me that again.

355
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:55,230
You've gotta tell
somebody about Brody.

356
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:56,670
No, I don't!

357
00:24:57,077 --> 00:24:59,020
And even if I wanted to,
which I don't,

358
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:00,720
I don't have a mark on me.

359
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:03,590
But you know what happened.
And he knows what happened.

360
00:25:03,626 --> 00:25:06,940
All he knows is that he was drunk,
and I'm not dead.

361
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:11,310
Hey. What happened
to you last night?

362
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:18,373
I was hoping you'd tell me.
I had way too much to drink.

363
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:22,522
I gotta go to the bathroom.

364
00:25:23,737 --> 00:25:26,681
Must have a bladder the size of a pea,
'cause he just went.

365
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:15,101
Full house! I win again!

366
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:19,950
Thank you.

367
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:27,380
You're meeting Miss Sakamoto
tomorrow at 11 A.M.

368
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:28,803
No Linderman?

369
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:31,571
Uh, he's, quote,
"otherwise occupied."

370
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,512
"Occupied." What is he,
a porta-potty?

371
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:37,281
Don't let Sakamoto geisha you.
Get him in the room.

372
00:26:37,316 --> 00:26:38,382
Okay, I will.

373
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:41,440
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

374
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:43,220
My fault. Are you all right?

375
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:46,550
Oh... so much for Celine Dion.

376
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:52,820
- Just the one ticket?
- Yeah. I'm, um...

377
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:55,200
here for a conference, and...

378
00:26:55,478 --> 00:26:58,243
I don't really like the people
that I work with, so...

379
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:00,791
So you're traveling alone,
is that it?

380
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:18,532
I've only met him
the once, but...

381
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,260
maybe I ought to do the
talking to start with.

382
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:23,710
He's, heh,
he's kind of a heroin addict.

383
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:26,951
Heroin addict?
You neglected to mention that.

384
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:30,041
Hey, just suspend the skepticism,
at least until you meet him.

385
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:32,410
The default scientific
position is skepticism.

386
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:34,742
Your father managed
to get around it.

387
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:38,763
I don't know, he took a pretty big leap.
Gotta respect that.

388
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:41,151
I did more than respect it.
I believed him.

389
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:43,601
I had to. I was his son.

390
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:46,191
Can't be only one reason
why you believed him.

391
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:48,380
Look at what's
happening to our planet.

392
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:52,492
Overpopulation, global warming,
drought, famine, terrorism.

393
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:55,300
Deep down,
we all sense something's not right.

394
00:27:56,668 --> 00:27:59,163
My father always
talked about how

395
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,930
an entire species will
go extinct while others,

396
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:06,262
no more unique or complex, will change
and adapt in extraordinary ways.

397
00:28:08,996 --> 00:28:11,270
He had a romantic
take on evolution.

398
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:14,700
And you don't?
You're both geneticists.

399
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:19,212
That is also evolution. We're all
just variations of the last model.

400
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:22,703
Yeah, cheap knockoffs
of our fathers.

401
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:43,643
Isaac. Hey, it's Peter Petrelli.
I'm a friend of Simone's.

402
00:29:47,147 --> 00:29:48,740
Isaac?

403
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,283
Isaac.

404
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:03,163
- Oh, hi, Lori.
- Hey.

405
00:30:03,757 --> 00:30:07,062
I saw you go off with Brody
Mitchum last night at the bonfire.

406
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,141
So?

407
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,341
So... what happened?

408
00:30:12,807 --> 00:30:15,812
Nothing. Nothing happened.

409
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:21,401
I went off with Brody Mitchum once.
"Nothing" happened to me too.

410
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:37,771
All of this is wrong.

411
00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:39,682
We shouldn't be
using my powers...

412
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:40,972
for personal gain.

413
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:43,123
We're supposed to be
saving the world.

414
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,441
We will.

415
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:46,240
But there's no law against...

416
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:48,292
looking good while we do it,
is there?

417
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:50,283
You said you wanted a costume.

418
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:51,640
Now you have one.

419
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,180
You make a big mistake!

420
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:23,591
Okay...

421
00:31:23,787 --> 00:31:27,000
Which casino do we hit next?

422
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,503
Are you crazy?

423
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,352
No more gambling!

424
00:31:31,637 --> 00:31:33,382
We need to get back
to our mission.

425
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:35,120
Hey. Can you tele-port us...

426
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:37,682
to the craps table in
the Caesar's Palace?

427
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:39,421
Hello, boys.

428
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:41,931
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

429
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:45,323
See... I had three Aces
at the poker table.

430
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:47,657
Next thing I know,
you two had 'em.

431
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,351
What is he saying?

432
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:51,752
Relax. I have it covered.

433
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:57,073
You better back off.
My friend has very big power.

434
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:01,501
Can take you all out.
Make you wish you never been born!

435
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:11,600
Oh, my God. Look at this view.

436
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:14,313
Everything looks so pretty
when you're up high.

437
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:16,360
Yes, it does.

438
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:19,360
Thank you.

439
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:24,660
God, don't you ever think
what it'd be like to just...

440
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:27,711
soar over that desert?

441
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:33,592
Hmm. I took a helicopter ride
over Red Rocks Park one time.

442
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:35,511
I wasn't thinking
in a helicopter.

443
00:32:35,616 --> 00:32:37,320
I was thinking more like...

444
00:32:37,507 --> 00:32:39,742
- flying.
- Flying?

445
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:46,371
You know,
if I were your husband,

446
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,850
I don't think I'd
let you travel alone.

447
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:53,750
I don't have a husband.
He left.

448
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:55,883
For another woman?

449
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:57,821
I wish.

450
00:32:58,196 --> 00:32:59,242
Man?

451
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:03,530
I would take that one too.

452
00:33:06,366 --> 00:33:10,790
He... He's...sort
of a... criminal.

453
00:33:11,086 --> 00:33:15,051
And by "sort of,"
I mean that he is.

454
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:17,122
Well, then,
my questions end there.

455
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,570
Thanks.

456
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:21,420
You have any kids?

457
00:33:21,455 --> 00:33:24,441
- That's another question.
- Right.

458
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,612
One.

459
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:29,180
A boy genius.

460
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:32,341
- Boy?
- Boy.

461
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:35,062
I've got two boys.
Not geniuses, just boys.

462
00:33:35,517 --> 00:33:37,910
It's weird having children,
isn't it?

463
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:41,143
It's like...
you've gotta be two different people.

464
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,412
Like the person
that they see and

465
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:45,573
the person that you really are?

466
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:47,220
Something like that, yeah.

467
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:50,761
- Still married.
- Yeah, I am.

468
00:33:53,338 --> 00:33:56,713
- Happy?
- Yes, very.

469
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:04,183
I guess my questions
stop there.

470
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:20,643
- I can't.
- I know, I know, I know.

471
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:22,901
I want to.

472
00:34:24,637 --> 00:34:25,671
I do.

473
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:31,123
Shh, shh, shh.

474
00:34:31,158 --> 00:34:33,073
I understand. It's okay.

475
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,072
I had a really great time.

476
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:38,382
Surprisingly.

477
00:34:41,736 --> 00:34:43,222
Thank you.

478
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:56,220
- Good night.
- Good night.

479
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:21,123
It would be a shame

480
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:25,672
to send you back to the
Congressman covered in bruises.

481
00:35:26,117 --> 00:35:27,841
I have to get home to my son.

482
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:30,532
And what are you gonna
tell your son? Huh?

483
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:33,272
How you gonna explain to your
son what happened to you

484
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:35,453
when you didn't
honor your agreement?

485
00:35:35,797 --> 00:35:38,461
Look, I will find another
way to pay Linderman.

486
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:41,831
No, let me rephrase
that question.

487
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:44,293
How are you going to
explain to your son

488
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:49,101
what happened to him when you
didn't honor your agreement?

489
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:51,721
You think about that, Niki.

490
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:54,790
Niki's not here right now.

491
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:14,522
If you threaten our son again,

492
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:19,932
I'm going to put my heel through
your skull. Do you understand?

493
00:36:20,146 --> 00:36:21,342
Yeah.

494
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,870
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, yeah!

495
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:36,012
You forget something?

496
00:36:48,658 --> 00:36:50,442
Shh.

497
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:55,093
What if we went back tomorrow?

498
00:37:55,387 --> 00:37:58,411
Look, I'm not trying to
discount your experience.

499
00:37:58,597 --> 00:37:59,481
It's just,

500
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:02,732
a week ago I was in my own country,
a respected professor.

501
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:08,182
Now you want me to stalk a heroin
addict who allegedly paints the future.

502
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:11,241
Mohinder?

503
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:02,260
All right.

504
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:14,153
What are you doing
here so late?

505
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:16,580
Making banners for Spirit Week.

506
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:20,463
Jackie was gonna give me a ride home,
but she left without me.

507
00:39:22,456 --> 00:39:28,200
- Can I get a lift?
- Yeah. I guess.

508
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:33,433
Thanks. Hey,
you drive a stick-shift, right?

509
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:36,832
Can I drive?

510
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:51,152
Don't you think it's
a little weird that

511
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:54,612
neither one of us remember what
happened the night of the bonfire?

512
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:59,102
- Must have been some night.
- Yeah, must have.

513
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:05,821
Slow down.
That was a red light.

514
00:40:06,526 --> 00:40:07,980
Whoops.

515
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:14,190
You know how to drive a stick-shift,
don't you?

516
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:16,621
There's a lot of
things that I know.

517
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:21,541
- Like what you did to me.
- What'd I do to you?

518
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,493
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

519
00:40:24,785 --> 00:40:27,670
You get drunk, you come on to me,
and it's my fault?

520
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:29,020
You're a liar.

521
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:32,792
Can't rape the willing, Claire.
You wanted it as bad as I did.

522
00:40:32,956 --> 00:40:34,022
Stop the car.

523
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:36,191
Did I want it as bad
as Laurie Trammel?

524
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,422
Laurie Trammel is a slut.

525
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:40,571
Is that what you're
gonna say about me?

526
00:40:40,586 --> 00:40:42,270
I already do.

527
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:44,773
You're just gonna keep at it,
aren't you?

528
00:40:44,986 --> 00:40:50,011
You should let it go, Claire.
There's nothing you can do about it.

529
00:40:53,895 --> 00:40:55,531
I can do this.

530
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:58,830
Aah!

531
00:41:16,837 --> 00:41:18,571
Just take the one.

532
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:08,453
Peter Petrelli?

533
00:42:10,256 --> 00:42:11,832
How is this happening?

534
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:15,813
I'm sorry if I scared you.

535
00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:18,893
You look different
without your scar.

536
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:22,783
- I don't know you, buddy.
- Not yet.

537
00:42:23,957 --> 00:42:27,593
My name is Hiro Nakamura.
I'm from the future.

538
00:42:29,577 --> 00:42:31,423
I have message for you.
