Man: for over a century,
I have lived in secret;

Hiding in the shadows,

Alone in the world.

Until now.

I am a vampire.

And this is my story.

* when there's fire *

* on a crown *

* should have turned-- *

An hour's drive
to hear that crap.

You know, it wasn't
even a band.

A guy with a guitar.

An hour each way.

He wasn't that bad.

He sounded like
james blunt.

What's wrong with that?

We already have
a james blunt.
One's all we need.

So why did you come?

Because I love you.

Nicely done.

* stretches out *

* in the way beyond *

What's with all the fog?

It'll clear
in a second.

Watch out!

Are you ok?!

We just hit someone!
Oh, my god!

Call for help.

Come on, come on!

Please be alive!

Oh, my god.

There's no signal!

Darren!

Darren?

I shouldn't
have come home.

I know the risk.

But I had no choice.

I have to know her.

Dear diary,

Today will be different.

It has to be.

I will smile,
and it will be
believable.

My smile was saying
"I'm fine, thank you."

"Yes, I feel much better."

I will no longer be
the sad little girl
who lost her parents.

I will start fresh,
be someone new.

It's the only way
I'll make it through.

<i>[Here wego by
mat kearney playing]</i>

Toast.
I can make toast.

It's all about the coffee,
aunt Jenna.

Is there coffee?

Your first day of school

And I'm totally
unprepared.

Lunch money?

I'm good.

Anything else?

A number two pencil?
What am I missing?

Don't you have
a big presentation today?

I'm meeting
with my thesis
advisor at...now.

Crap!

Then go. We'll be fine.

You ok?

Don't start.

* oh, oh, here we go again *

* I know
how I lost a friend *

* we go 'round
and 'round again *

* oh, oh *

* oh, oh *

So grams is telling me
I'm psychic.

Our ancestors
were from salem,

Which isn't all
that, I know, crazy,

But she's going on
and on about it,

And I'm like, put this woman
in a home already!

But then I started
thinking,

I predicted Obama and I predicted
Heath Ledger,

And I still think Florida
will break off

And turn into little
resort islands.

Elena!

Back in the car.

I did it again,
didn't I?

I--I'm sorry, Bonnie.

You were telling me that...

That I'm
psychic now.

Right. Ok,
then predict something.

About me.

I see...

What was that?!

Oh, my god!

Elena, are you ok?

It's ok. I'm fine.

It was like a bird
or something.

It came out
of nowhere.

Really, I can't be
freaked out

By cars for the rest
of my life.

I predict this year
is going to be kick ass.

And I predict all
the sad and dark
times are over

And you are going
to be beyond happy.

Major lack of
male real estate.

Look at
the shower curtain
on kelly beach.

She looks a hot--
Can I still say "tranny mess"?

No, that's over.

Ahh, find a man,
coin a phrase.

It's a busy year.

He hates me.

That's not hate.

That's "you dumped me, 
but I'm too cool to show it,

"But secretly
I'm listening

To air supply's
greatest hits."

Elena. Oh, my god.

How are you?

Oh, it's so good
to see you.

How is she?
Is she good?

Caroline, I'm right here.

And I'm fine.
Thank you.

Really?

Yes. Much better.

Oh, you poor thing.

Ok, Caroline.

Oh!

Ok, see you guys
later?

Ok! Bye.

No comment.

I'm not going
to say anything.

Don't take more than two
in a six-Hour window.

Hey, Vicki.

I knew I'd find you here
with the crackheads.

Hey.

Hey, Pete Wentz called.

He wants
his nail polish back.

<i>Pete Wentz, huh?
How old school T.R.L. of you.</i>

Carson Daly fan?

Oh, Ty, be nice.
Be nice.

That's Elena's
little brother.

I know who he is.

I'll still
kick his ass.

* sense of humor's
void and numb *

* and I'm bored to tears *

* I'm bored to tears *

Hold up.
Who's this?

Elena: all I see is back.

It's a hot back.

Secretary: your records
are incomplete.

You're missing
immunization records,

And we do insist
on transcripts.

Please look again.

I'm sure everything
you need is there.

Well, you're right.

So it is.

I'm sensing seattle,
and he plays the guitar.

You're really going to run this 
whole psychic thing

into the ground, huh?
- Pretty much.

Jeremy,
good batch, man.

I'll be right back.

Please be hot.

Whoa!
Pants down, chick!

Great.

It's the first
day of school
and you're stoned.

No, I'm not.
Where is it?

Is it on you?
Stop, all right?!

You need to chill yourself,
all right?

Chill myself?
What is that,

Stoner talk?

Dude,
you are so cool.

Look, stop! I don't
have anything on me.
Are you crazy?

You haven't seen
crazy, jeremy!

I gave you
a summer pass,

But I am done
watching you
destroy yourself.

No, no, no,
you know what?

Go ahead.
Keep it up.
But just know

That I am going
to be there

To ruin your buzz
every time,
you got it?

Jeremy, I know
who you are.

And it's not
this person.

So don't be
this person.

I don't need this.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Uh, pardon me.

Um...

Is this the men's room?

Yes. Um,
I was just,

Um--I was just--

It's a long story.

Just...

Thank you.

Once our home state
of virginia
joined confederacy

In 1861, it created
a tremendous
amount of tension

Within the state.

People in virginia's
northwest region

Had different ideals
than those from
the traditional deep south.

Then Virginia
divided in 1863

with the northwest region
joining the union.

* do you know
where your heart is? *

* do you think
you can find it? *

* or did you trade it
for something *

* somewhere *

* better just to have it *
[bird squawks]

* do you know where
your love is? *

* do you think
that you lost it? *

Dear diary,

I made it through the day.

I must have said,
"I'm fine, thanks,"

At least 37 times.

And I didn't mean it once.

But no one noticed.

* 'cause
you won't let go *

* of anything
you hold *

Elena: when someone
asks, "how are you?"

They really don't
want an answer.

* all I need
is the air I breathe *

* and a place to rest *

Ok.

Hi, bird.

That's not creepy
or anything.

Shoo!

That's what I thought.

Ahh!

You ok?

Were you
following me?

No, I, uh, I just--
I saw you fall.

Uh-Huh, and you just
happened to be

Hanging out
in a cemetery.

I'm visiting.
I have family here.

Oh.

Wow. Tactless.

I'm sorry.
It's the fog,

It's making me
foggy.

And then back there,
there was this bird,

And it was all
very hitchcock
for a second.

That is the bird movie,
right, the hitchcock?

I'm Elena.

I'm Stefan.

I know.

We have history
together.

And english and french.

Right.

Oh.

Thanks.

Nice ring.

Oh. Um,

It's a family ring, yeah.

I'm kinda stuck with it.
It's weird, huh?

No, no. It's just,
I mean, there are rings

And then there's that.

Did you hurt yourself?

Hmm?
Did you hurt yourself?

Oh, uh,

I don't know.

Oh! Look at that.

That is not pretty.

You ok?

You should go.

Take care of that.

Really, it's nothing.

I lost control today.

Everything
I've kept buried inside

Came rushing
to the surface.

I'm simply not able
to resist her.

Thanks.
Hey.

Working.

Thanks, vick.

Do you need
another refill?

I'd love one.

Please tell me
you're not hooking
up with my sister.

I'm not hooking up
with your sister.

You're such a dick.

Hey, what's
your deal?

I mean, summer
you act one way

And then school
starts and you can't
be bothered.

Look, jeremy,
I really appreciate
all the pharmaceuticals,

But you can't keep
following me around
like a lost puppy.

When's the last time

You had sex
with a puppy?

Hey, keep it down.
I don't want to tell
the whole world

I deflowered
Elena's kid brother.

Yeah, and deflowered
and deflowered.

We hooked up a few times
in a drug haze. It's over.

You gotta back off
between you ruin things
between me and Tyler.

Oh, come on,
the guy's
a total douche.

He only wants you
for your ass.

Yeah?

What do you want me for?

His name
is Stefan Salvatore.

He lives with uncle up at 
the old Salvatore boarding house.

He hasn't lived here
since he was a kid.

Military family,
so they moved around a lot.

He's a gemini, and his
favorite color is blue.

You got all of that
in one day?

Oh, please, I got all that
between third and fourth period.

We're planning
a june wedding.

I'm meeting Bonnie
at the grill.

Ok, have fun.
Wait, I got this.

Don't stay out late,
it's a school night.

Well done,
aunt Jenna.

Oh.

Sorry, I was about to knock.

I wanted to apologize
for my disappearing act earlier.

I know it was...

Strange.

No worries.

I get it, blood
makes you squeamish.

Um, something like that.

How's your leg?

Oh, it's fine.

Just a scratch,
barely.

How did you know
where I lived?

It's a small town.

I asked
the first person I saw.

Um, I thought
you might want this back.

Oh, I must have
dropped it.

I--
Thank you.

Don't worry,
I didn't...read it.

No? 

Why not? Most people
would have.

Well, I wouldn't want
anyone to read mine.

You keep a journal?

Yeah, if I don't
write it down,

I forget it.

Memories are too important.

Yeah.

I'm just gonna,

Um, you don't have
to stay out there.

I'm fine.

Sorry, were you going
somewhere?

Yeah, I'm meeting
a friend.

Do you want to come?

How's Elena doing?

Her mom
and dad died.
How do you think?

She's putting on
a good face,

But it's only been
four months.

Has she said anything
about me?
Oh, no.

So not getting
in the middle.

You pick up
the phone
and call her.

I feel weird calling her.

She broke up with me.

Give it
more time, matt.

* when I'm with him *

* I'm thinking of you *

* oh-Ho *

More time, huh?

* what you would do *

* if you were the one *

* who was spending *

Hey, I'm matt,
nice to meet you.

Hi. Stefan.

Hey.

Hey.

So, you were born
in mystic falls?

Mm-Hmm. And moved
when I was
still young.

Parents?

My parents
passed away.

I'm sorry.

Any siblings?

None that I talk to.

I live with my uncle.

So, Stefan,

if you're new, then you don't know
about the party tomorrow.

It's a back to school thing
at the falls.

Are you going?

Of course she is.

<i>[Running up that hill
by placebo playing]</i>

You promised.

This was
an animal attack.

Don't give me that.
I know the game.

You tear them up enough,
they always suspect
an animal attack.

You said you had it
under control.

And I do.

Please, uncle Stefan.

Mystic falls
is a different place now.

It's been quiet for years,
but there are people
who still remember.

And you being here,

It's just going
to stir things up.

It's not my intention.
Then what is?

Why did you come back?
After all this time, why now?

I don't have
to explain myself.

I know that you can't
change what you are.

But you don't
belong here anymore.

Where do I belong?

I can't tell you
what to do.

But coming back here
was a mistake.

* you want to know *

* know that
it doesn't hurt me *

* oh, oh, oh *

* you want to hear about
the deal I'm making *

* and if I only could *

* make a deal with god *

* and get him
to swap our places *

* be runnin' up that road *

* be runnin' up that hill *

* be runnin' up
that building *

* hill, hill *

* if I only could *

* be running up that hill *

* hill *

The battle of
willow creek

Took place right at
the end of the war

In our very own
mystic falls.

How many casualties
resulted in this battle?

Ms. Bennett?

Um...a lot?

I'm not sure.

Like a whole lot.

Cute becomes dumb
in an instant,
ms. Bennett.

Mr. Donovan.

Would you like to take
this opportunity

To overcome
your embedded
jock stereotype?

It's ok, mr. Tanner,
I'm cool with it.

Hmm. Elena?

Surely you can
enlighten us about

One of the town's most 
significantly historical events?

I'm sorry, I--
I don't know.

I was willing to be
lenient last year

For obvious reasons, Elena,

But the personal excuses
ended with summer break.

Stefan: there were
346 casualties,

Unless you're counting
local civilians.

That's correct.

Mister...

Salvatore.

Salvatore.
Any relation to

The original settlers
here at mystic falls?

Distant.

Well, very good.

Except, of course,
there were no
civilian casualties

In this battle.

Actually,
there were 27, sir.

Confederate soldiers,
they fired on the church,

Believing it to be
housing weapons.

They were wrong.

It was a night
of great loss.

The founder's
archives are, uh,

Stored in civil hall
if you'd like to
brush up on your facts.

Mr. Tanner.
[All chuckling]

Mr. Tanner: hmm.

* note the feeling
when we lift off *

* watching the world,
so small and low *

What do you mean,
you never hooked up?

Girl: people look up to me.

I have to set an example.

Bonnie:
just admit it, Elena.

Oh, ok, so he's
a little pretty.

He has that
romance novel stare.

Stefan looked deep
into her eyes,

Piercing her very soul.

Hey! You made it!

I did.

Well, let's
get you a drink.

Well, I'm--
Oh, come on.

So where is he?

I don't know.

You tell me,
you're the psychic one.

Right, I forgot.
Ok, so give me a sec.

Grams says I have
to concentrate.

Wait, you need
a crystal ball.

Ahh.

Ta da.

What?

That was weird.

When I touched you,
I saw a crow.

What?

A crow.

There was fog,

A man.

I'm drunk.

It's the drinking.
There's nothing
psychic about it.

Yeah? Ok, I'm gonna
get a refill.

Ok.

Bonnie!

Hi.

Hi.

I did it again,
didn't it?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

You're upset about something.
Oh, uh,

No, it's Bonnie.
She's...

You know what?

Never mind.
You're...here.

I'm here.

* but who decides
which route we take *

* as people drift
into a dream world *

You know, you're kind
of the talk of the town.

Am I?
Mm-Hmm.

Mysterious new guy,
oh, yeah.

Well, you have
the mysterious thing
going, too.

Twinged in sadness.

What makes you think
that I'm sad?

Well, we did
meet in a graveyard.

Right.

Well, no, technically
we met in the men's room.

You don't want
to know, it's...

It's not exactly
party chit-Chat.

Well, I've never really been
very good at, uh,

Chit-chat.

Last spring...

My parents' car
drove off of a bridge

Into the lake.

And I was in the backseat

And I survived, but...

They didn't.

So that's my story.

You won't be sad
forever, Elena.

No, Ty.

I'm not having sex
against a tree.

Oh, come on,
it would be hot.
For who?

No, it's not
going to happen.

It's not going to
happen, not here,
not like this.

No. I said no.

I said no!
Ow, that hurts!

Hey,
leave her alone.

You know, you're starting
to get on my nerves, gilbert.

Just go, Tyler, get the hell
away from me.

Wow. Vicki donovan says no.

That's a first.

I didn't need your help.

It seems like
you did.

He was just drunk.
I'm drunk.

Am I throwing
myself at you?

No, you're worse.

You want to talk to me,
get to know me,

See into my soul and screw
and screw and screw

Until you're done with me.

Is that what
you think?

That's what I know.

I like Bonnie,
she seems like a good friend.

Best friend
in the world.
And matt,

He can't seem to, uh,
take his eyes off of us.

Matt's that friend
since childhood

That you start
dating

Because you owe it
to yourselves

To see if you can
be more.

And?

And then
my parents died,

And everything
changes.

Anyway, matt and I,

Together we just,
I don't know,

It wasn't, um...

It wasn't...

Passionate.

No.

No, it wasn't
passionate.

Hey, um,
are you ok?

Um,

Your eye,
it just, it's--

Oh, um...

Yeah, no.
It's, um, it's nothing.

Um, are you thirsty?

I'm gonna get us a drink.

Jeremy?

Is that you?

Jeremy?

Looking for someone?

Hey.

When you
broke up with me,

You said it was
because you needed
some time alone.

You don't look
so alone to me.

Matt, you don't
understand. It's--

That's ok, Elena.

You do what
you have to do.

I just want to let
you know that...

I still believe in us.

And I'm not
giving up on that.

* and when I think
about a day without *

Matt.

* every day's the same *

* wish that you could
find someone *

Hey! There you are.

Have you been down
to the falls yet?

Because they are
really cool at night.

And I can show you.

If you want.

I think you've had
too much to drink.

Well, of course
I have.

So--
Caroline.

You and me,

It's not gonna happen.

Sorry.

* no, don't *

I was wondering
who abducted you,

But now I know.

Is she like that with,
uh, all the guys?

No.

You're fresh meat.

She'll back off eventually.
Hmm.

God, you gotta be kidding me!

What is it?

My brother.
The drunk one?

That would be the one.

Excuse me.
Need some help?

Trust me, you're not
going to want to
witness this.

Jeremy!

Jeremy!

Jeremy, where the hell
are you going?

I don't want
to hear it!

Yeah, well, too bad!

Vicki? No!

Oh, my god, it's Vicki!
Oh, my god!

No!

Somebody help!

Vicki? Vicki,
what the hell?!

What happened to her?

Somebody,
call an ambulance!

Everybody back up,
give her some space!

It's her neck.
Something bit her.
She's losing a lot of blood.

Put this on her neck.

Vicki, Vicki, come on,
open your eyes, look at me.

What's going on?

Someone else was
attacked tonight,
Zach, and it wasn't me.

Damon.

Hello, brother.

Crow's a bit much,
don't you think?

Wait till you see
what I can do
with the fog.

When'd you get here?

Well, I couldn't miss
your first day at school.

Your hair's different.

I like it.

It's been
15 years, Damon.

Thank god.

I couldn't take
another day of the nineties.

That horrible grunge look?

Did not suit you.

Remember, Stefan,
it's important
to stay away from fads.

Why are you here?

I miss
my little brother.

You hate small towns.

It's boring.
There's nothing
for you to do.

I've managed to keep
myself busy.

You know, you left
that girl alive tonight.

That's very clumsy of you.

Ah. That can be
a problem...for you.

Why are you here now?

I could ask you
the same question.

However,
I'm fairly certain

Your answer can be
summed up all into

One little word...

Elena.

Hey.

We're gonna go
mainline coffee,
wait for news.

I gotta take
jeremy home.

Elena, there's no way
I'm psychic.

I know that.

But whatever I saw,

Or I think I saw,

I have this feeling...

Bonnie, what?

That it's just
the beginning.

She took
my breath away.

Elena.

She's a dead ringer
for katherine.

Is it working, Stefan?

Being around her,
being in her world?

Does it make you
feel alive?

She's not katherine.

Well, let's hope not.

We both know
how that ended.

Tell me something,
when's the last time

You had something
stronger than
a squirrel?

I know what you're doing,
Damon. It's not gonna work.

Yeah? Come on.
Don't you crave
a little?

Stop it. Let's do it.
Together.

I saw a couple girls
out there.

Or just, let's just
cut to the chase,

Let's just go
straight for Elena!

Stop it!

Imagine what her
blood tastes like!

I can.

I said stop!

I was impressed.

I give it a six.

Missing style, but I was
pleasantly surprised.

Very good
with the whole face--

thing.
It was good.

You know, it's all fun and games,
Damon, huh?

But wherever you go,
people die.

That's a given.
Not here.

I won't allow it.

I take that
as an invitation.

Damon, please.

After all these
years, can't we just
give it a rest?

I promised you
an eternity of misery,

So I'm just keeping my word.

Just stay away
from Elena.

Where's your ring?

Oh, yeah, sun's coming up
in a couple of hours,

And, poof,
ashes to ashes.

Relax.

It's right here.

You should know better
than to think you're
stronger than me.

You lost that fight
when you stopped

Feeding on people.

I wouldn't try it again.

I think we woke
Zach up. Hmm.

Sorry, Zach.

You ok?

I called Jenna,
she's on her way.

Those people
in uniforms,

Last time I checked,
they're the police.

People are going
to stop giving you
breaks, jer.

They just don't care
anymore.

They don't remember
that our parents
are dead,

Because they've got
their own lives
to deal with.

The rest of the world
has moved on.

You should try, too.

I've seen you in the cemetery
writing in your diary.

Is that--Is that
supposed to be you
moving on?

Mom and dad wouldn't
have wanted this.

Are you sober yet?

No. 

Keep drinking.
I gotta get you home.

I gotta get me home.

Why didn't he
go for me?

You know, how come

The guys that I want
never want me?

I'm not touching that.

I'm inappropriate.

I always say
the wrong thing.

And...

Elena always says
the right thing.

She doesn't even try!

And he just picks her.

And she's always the one
that everyone picks,

For everything.

And I try so hard,

And...

I'm never the one.

It's not a competition,
Caroline.

Yeah, it is.

* I was a heartbreaker *

* I loved you *

* the same way I do *

* but I've got so much
wickedness and sin *

* my name is pearl *

* and I love you *

* the best way I know how *

Vicki...

Hey.

Hey, it's ok.

You're gonna be ok.

Matt--
Shh.

Hey, don't try
to talk, ok?

You're fine.

Vampire.

Dear diary,

I couldn't
have been more wrong.

I thought that I could smile,
nod my way through it;

Pretend like
it would all be ok.

* some things
we don't talk about *

* better do without *

I had a plan.

I wanted to change
who I was;

Create a life
as someone new,

Someone without the past.

Without the pain.

Someone alive.

* you can never say never *

But it's
not that easy.

The bad things
stay with you.

They follow you.

* than we were before *

* don't let me go *

You can't
escape them,

As much as you want to.

* don't let me go *

* don't let me go *

* don't let me go *

* don't let me go *

All you can do
is be ready for the good.

So when it comes,

You invite it in,
because you need it.

I need it.

* I will be your guardian *

* for all that's coming in *

I know it's late.

But, uh...

I needed to know
that you were ok.

You know, for months,

That's all anyone's
wondered about me.

If I'll be ok.

What do you tell them?

That I'll be fine.

Do you ever mean it?

Ask me tomorrow.

It's warmer in the house.
We can talk.

Would you like
to come in?

Yes.

For over a century,

I have lived in secret, until now.

I know the risk, but I had no choice.

I have to know her.

I'm Elena.
I'm Stefan.

I know. We have history together.

Last spring, my parents' car

drove off of a bridge into the lake.

You won't be sad forever, Elena.

I live with my uncle.

Any siblings?

None that I talk to.

Hello, brother.
Damon.

Elena, she's a dead ringer for Catherine.

Wherever you go,
people die.

My God, it's Vickie!

Something bit her, she's losing a lot of blood.

Somebody help!

Vampire.

Don't you crave a little?
Stop.

Let's do it. Let's just go straight for Elena.

Imagine what her blood tastes like!

Stop!
Arghh!

Stay away from Elena.

I'll take that as an invitation.

* I tremble *

* tremble, tremble *

* Tremble, tremble *

* tremble, tremble *

* You're gonna eat me alive *

Hey. Did you hear that?
Hear what?

I heard thunder.

There's no thunder.

Are you sure?

Because if it rains,
then we won't be able
to see the comet.

It's not gonna rain.

Listen, i...

Got you a little
something.

It's back
in the car.

Don't you move.
mm-mm.

Hmm?

* Can you hear my heart *

* Beating like a hammer? *

Stay dry.

It's not gonna rain.

* My heart keeps beating like a hammer *

I knew it!

* Come take my pulse *

I told you it was gonna rain!

* Keeps beating like a hammer *

* Beating like a hammer *

Open!

No!

Please!

Dear diary,

this morning is... different.

There is change. I can sense it,

feel it.

I'm awake.

For the first time in a long time,

I feel completely and undeniably wide awake.

For once, I don't regret the day before it begins.

I welcome the day...

Both: because I know...

I will see her again.

I will see him again.

For the first time in a long time,

I feel good.

* And every building falls *

* And all the stars fade *

Do I look adult?

As in respectfully parental?

Depends where you're going.

Jeremy's parent-teacher conference.

Hair up or down?

Sexy stewardess.

Boozy housewife.

Up it is.

You're feisty today.

I feel good, which is rare.
So I've decided to go with it.

Fly free, walk on sunshine, and all that stuff.

Where is Jeremy?

He left early.

Something about getting to wood shop early

to finish a birdhouse.

There is no wood shop, is there?

No.
Yeah.

* ooh, ooh *

* closer to love *

* ooh, ooh *

You can't be in here, hon. Visiting hours

don't start till 9:00.

I just... 

How is she?

She's lost a lot of blood.

Yeah, but she's gonna be ok, right?

She needs her rest.

So you come back later.

Come on.

Originally discovered nearly 5 centuries ago,

it hasn't been over Mystic Falls in over 145 years.

Now, the comet will be its brightest

right after dusk

during tomorrow's celebration.

Are we bothering you, Mr. Salvatore?

Ms. Gilbert?

I brought it.

Told you.

"Wuthering Heights" by Ellis Bell.

You know, I can't believe she didn't use her real name.

All the Bronte sisters used pseudonyms.

It was the time.

Female writers weren't very accepted then.

Where did you get it?

Uh, it was passed down.

Through the family.

Ah.

I have lots of books. Go ahead. Keep it.

Oh, no. I... 

But I would like to read it again.

I promise I'll give it back.

Ok.

I'm confused.

Are you psychic or clairvoyant?

Technically, grams says I'm a witch.

My ancestors were these really cool

Salem witch chicks or something.

Grams tried to explain it all,

but she was looped on the liquor

so I kinda tuned out. Crazy family, yes.

Witches? I don't think so.

Yeah, well, feel free to conjure
up the name and number

of that guy from last night.

I didn't see him, you did.

Why didn't you just talk to him?

I don't know. I was drunk.

* I never know how to treat you *

* You say I love you but it ain't true *

* I like to grab you by the hair *

Hey, Tyler. Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.

I was just wondering how Vickie's doing,

since you guys are so close.

Is she ok?

She's fine. Now get out of here.

How bad is she?

Do they know what attacked her?

Is she going to make a full recovery?

Was she happy to see you?
What room number was she in?

I'm going to kick your ass.

Yeah, you keep saying that,

but when are you actually going to do it?

Huh? 'Cause I vote for right here and right now.

* I like to grab you by the hair *

Walk away, Gilbert.

It's your final warning.

No, this is your final warning, dick.

I'm sick of watching you play Vickie.

You hurt herne more time,
I swear to God, I will kill you.

* I like to grab you by the hair *

Damn, that was like a death threat.

Did you hear that?

They're keeping her overnight to make sure

There's no infection,

but she should be able to come home tomorrow.

That's good news.
Yeah.

Did you get in touch with your mom?

Called and left a message.

She's in Virginia Beach with her boyfriend,

so... we'll see how long it takes
her to come rushing home.

Vickie's lucky that she's ok.

I know, and now there's talk
of some missing campers.

Did she say what kind of animal
it was that attacked her?

She said it was a vampire.

What?

Yeah, she wakes up last night
and mutters "vampire"

and then passes out.

Ok, that is weird.

I think she was drunk.

So what's up with you and the new guy?

Matt, the last thing that I want to do is hurt you.

You know, I'm... 

I'm actually gonna go back to the hospital.

I want to be there when Vickie wakes up,

get the real story about last night.

Ok.

As Jeremy's teacher, I'm concerned.

All right? It's the third day of school

and he's skipped 6 of his classes.

Mr. Tanner,

are you aware that Jeremy
and Elena's parents died?

4 months ago, a great loss.

Car accident.

Wickery bridge, if I remember correctly.

And you're related to the family how?

The, uh, mother's kid sister?

Younger sister.

Right.
Yes.

6 classes? Are you sure?

I mean, that's kind of hard to do.

Not when you're on drugs.

It's his attempt at coping, Ms. Summers.

And the signs are there.

He's moody, withdrawn, argumentative,

hungover.

Are there any other relatives in the picture?

I'm their sole guardian.

Uh-huh.

Could there be?

What are you suggesting, exactly?

It's an impossible job, isn't it,

raising two teens?

It's been tough,

but, no, it's not.

Wrong answer.

It is an extremely impossible job,

and anything less and you're not doing it properly.

Whoa!

Vick.

Vickie, hey.

Vick, it's Matt. Hey, what's wrong?

No! No!

Get off!

No!

No!

No!

It was an animal that attacked you.

It came out of the night and jumped you.

You blacked out.

It's all you remember.
It's all I remember.

An animal attacked you. You blacked out.

It's all you remember.
It's all I remember.

Nurse! I need help!

It's my sister.

She seems fine.

Well, I was talking to grams,

and she said the comet is
a sign of impending doom.

The last time it passed over Mystic Falls,

there was lots of death.
So much blood and carnage,

it created a bed of paranormal activity.

Yeah, and then you poured grams another shot

and she told you about the aliens.

So then what?

So then nothing.

You and Stefan talked all night?

There was no sloppy first kiss

or touchy feely of any kind?

Nope.

We didn't go there.

Not even a handshake?

I mean, Elena,

we are your friends.

Ok? You are supposed to share the smut.

We just talked for hours.

Ok, what is with the blockage?

Just jump his bones already! Ok, it's easy.

Boy likes girl, girl likes boy,

sex.

Profound.

* ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

Where are you going?

Caroline's right. It is easy.

If I sit here long enough,

I'll end up talking myself out of it

instead of doing what I started
the day saying I was going to do.

* I trust you *

I picked up dinner. Tacos.

I had an urge for guacamole.

No, I'm good, thanks.

Eat anyway. It's a ruse.

I want to talk.

Hey, you! Come.

Sit.

Back in school, freshman year,

I could eat my weight in nachos,

with extra cheese.

It was my munchie food whenever I got stoned.

You get high?

Did.

Past tense.

But, yeah. Loved it.

Anything to get a little distraction

from life... reality.

And it worked.

For a while.

Never lasts, though.

Hey, I'm not saying I wouldn't
love to rail back and kick it,

but with a thesis looming

and a waistline expanding...

What the... 

Finally you're awake.

Hey. How are you feeling?

You look better.

I was worried before.

You really had me freaked
out with all that screaming.

Wait, what are you talking about?

You don't remember?

I feel fine.

Good, good.

Doctor said you could come home tomorrow.

Vick, what attacked you in the woods?

An animal.

What else could it have been?

Hey. How do you feel?

I'm ok.

I... I'm gonna... 

I'm gonna go grab a coffee.

Hey, Jer.

Why are you here?

I just wanted to see how you were doing.

Did you see that look on Matt's face?

That was suspicion. I don't want people

to find out about us, Jeremy.

Well, you gotta get over that.

Tyler is finally showing some interest.

You have to get over that, too.

Do you see Mr. Concerned?

Tyler? Are you under there?

No.

It's not cool for people to know.

Ok? I'm older than you,

and Matt and Elena would freak.

No one's going to suspect anything.

Why wouldn't I check on you?

I mean, I'm the one who found you.

You are?

Yeah, I carried you out of the woods.

Thank you.

Yeah, you're welcome.

Stefan?

Stefan?

I... I'm sorry for barging in. The door was...

Open.

You must be Elena.

I'm Damon, Stefan's brother.

He didn't tell me he had a brother.

Well, Stefan's not one to brag.

Please, come.

I'm sure Stefan will be along any second.

Wow.

This is your living room?

Living room, parlor, Sotheby's auction.

It's a little kitschy for my taste.

I see why my brother's so smitten.

It's about time. For a while there,

I never thought he'd get over the last one.

Nearly destroyed him.

The last one?

Yeah.

Katherine, his girlfriend?

Oh, you two haven't had the
awkward exes conversation yet.

Nope.

Oops. Well, I'm sure it'll come up now.

Or maybe he didn't want to tell you

because he didn't want you
to think he was on the rebound.

We all know how those relationships end.

You say it like

every relationship is doomed to end.

I'm a fatalist.

Hello, Stefan.

Elena.

I didn't know you were coming over.

I know. I should have called, I just... 

Oh, don't be silly. You're welcome any time.

Isn't she, Stefan?

You know, I should break out
the family photo albums,

or some home movies.

But... I have to warn you.

He wasn't always such a looker.

Thank you for stopping by, Elena.

Nice to see you.

Yeah, I should probably go.

It was nice to meet you, Damon.

Great meeting you, too, Elena.

Stefan?

Stefan?

Great gal.

Whoo. She's got spunk.

You, on the other hand, look pooped.

Did you over-exert yourself today?

Let me guess... hospital.

Someone had to clean up your mess.

Well, were you successful?

Did the powers of persuasion work?

Remember, if you don't feed properly,

none of those little tricks work right.

How long was Elena here?

Were you worried, Stefan?

Scared we may be doomed

to repeat the past?

Isn't that why you play your little
game, "I'm a high school human"?

I'm not playing any game.
Of course you are.

We both know

the closest you'll ever get to humanity

is when you rip it open and feed on it.

What kind of game are you playing...

Damien?

Guess you'll just have to wait and see, won't you?

He's on the rebound and has raging family issues.

Well, at least it's an ex-girlfriend.

Wait till you date a guy with mommy issues

or cheating issues.

Or amphetamine issues.

Jeremy.

Jeremy, where were you?

More stoner stories?

Look, Jenna, I get it, you were cool.

And so that's... that's cool.

Oh, no, no, no!

Ow! Why?

Why... why did you do that? Listen up!

Quit ditching class or you're grounded.

No discussion.

Parental authority, I like it.

Sleep tight.

* And I'm an animal *

* You're an animal, too *

Matt.

Mattie?

Tonight, night of the comet.

Would you like a program?

He didn't call, huh?

Or text.

But I realized we never even exchanged that stuff.

We've never gotten to the texting part.

That's an important milestone in any relationship.

Isn't it?
The timing is wrong, anyway.

When is it ever right?

I'm not ready, Bonnie.

Who is?

At least I put myself out there.

Is that what you're calling it?

What do you mean?

All I'm hearing is reasons why you can't.

* Get back down to street level *

* I get around *

* Here I come when I better go *

* I say yes when I ought to say no *

* Here I come when I better go *

* I say yes when I ought to say no *

What is Damon doing here? Why did he come home?

'Cause I came home.

He wants to make my life miserable.

That's how he enjoys his.

Well, he's putting us all at risk.

This girl in the hospital could talk.

She won't.

I took care of her.

You're sure?

I'm not sure, Zach.

I don't know how well it worked.

I'm not as strong as Damon.

So what happens if it doesn't work?

I don't know.

I'll deal with it.

Is she worth it?

Uncle Stefan, this girl you came back for.

Vickie, what are you doing here?

Fighting with Robert about my schedule.

You'd think getting ripped up by a rabid animal

would merit an extra sick day.
Are you feeling ok?

I hurt.

Well, the doctor gave you something, right?

The kid stuff.

Nothing with an "o" in it.

I think they were onto me.

Here. Knock yourself out, literally.

Thanks, Jer.

So you gonna, uh, watch the comet later?

I hadn't really thought about it.

But I could be talked into it.

I'll meet you out there in a few.

Hey, Vick. How you feeling?

Like you care.

What are you lookin' at, Gilbert?

Hey, I got some candles.

Hi.

Hey.
Hey.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Thank you.

Hi.

Hi.

You know, that comet...

it's been traveling across
space for thousands of years.

All alone.

Yeah, Bonnie says it's a harbinger of evil.

I think it's just a ball of...

snow and ice,

trapped on a path that it can't escape.

And once every 145 years,

it gets to come home.

I'm sorry about yesterday.

I wasn't myself.

You seem to spend a lot of time apologizing.

Well, I have a lot to apologize for.

Yesterday, that wasn't about you, ok?

You didn't tell me that you had a brother.

We're not close.

It's, uh...

it's complicated.

Always.

He told me about your ex, Catherine.

What did he say?

That she broke your heart.

That was a long time ago.

When you lose someone, it stays with you,

always reminding you of how easy it is to get hurt.

Elena...

It's ok, Stefan.

I get it.

You have no idea how much I get it.

Complicated brother? Check.

Complicated ex? Check.

Too complicated to even contemplate
dating, double check.

It's ok.

We met, and we talked,

and it was epic, but...

then the sun came up and reality set in

so...

I know you.

Well, that's unfortunate.

Um...

I don't... I don't know how,

but...

your face.

Excuse me. Sorry.

Hey, has anyone seen Vickie?

You're her stalker. You tell us.

I can't find her.

She probably found somebody else to party with.

Sorry, pill pusher, I guess you've been replaced.

What's with the pill pusher?

Ask him. You wanna do this right now?

Are you dealing?

She's never gonna go for you.

She already did.

Over and over and over again.

Yeah, right.

You slept with Vickie Donovan?

I mean, Vickie Donovan slept with you?

There's no way.

And I didn't even have to force her into it.

What the hell is he talking about, Todd?

Nothing, man, just ignore him, he's a punk.

You know what, how about all of you shut up

and help me find my sister?
We'll check the back.

I'll check the square. I'll come with you.

Oh, no, no, no.

You are coming with me.

So that's your game now, dealing?

I'm not dealing.
Look, I'm sick

of the tough love speech, Jer.
It's really having no impact.

You and Jenna, between the two of you...

We can stop if you want.

Send you to a therapist where
you'll be forced to deal with it

or to rehab where you'll sit in group

and tell some stranger how
you let your life fall apart.

Or you could talk to me.

I vote for none of the above.

Hey.

Hey.

Have you seen my sister?

No, sorry. I can't find her.

She's missing.

I'll keep an eye out for her.

Hey.

I saw you at the hospital yesterday.

Did you?

What were you doing there?

Visiting.

Visiting?

You know,

Elena and I, we've known
each other for a long time.

We might not be together right now,

but I look out for her.

And I'll always look out for her.

You really have to stop screaming.

No, please, stop. Don't...

Shh. I got you.

Excuse me.

No! No!

I gotta do it. I'm not gonna drop you.

Not bad.

Have you been eating bunnies?

Let her go.

Shh. really?

Ok.

No! No, no, no!

Uhh!

Relax.

What's happening?

I don't need her to be dead, but...

you might.

What attacked you the other night?

I don't know. An animal.

Are you sure about that?

Think.

Think about it. Think really hard.

What attacked you?

A vampire.

Who did this to you?
You did!

Wrong!
Don't.

It was Stefan. Don't.

Come here.

Stefan Salvatore did this to you.

Stefan Salvatore did this to me.

He's a vampire.

A vicious, murderous monster.

Please, Damon. Please don't do this.

If you couldn't fix it before,

I don't know what you can do now.

Aah!

Uhh!

Your choice of lifestyle

has made you weak.

A couple of vampire parlor tricks

is nothing compared to the
power that you cod have,

that you now need.

But you can change that.

Human blood gives you that.

No!

You have two choices.

You can feed and make her forget.

Or you can let her run, screaming
"vampire" through the town square.

That's what this is about?

You want to expose me?

No! I want you to remember who you are!

Why? So what, so I'll feed?

So I'll kill?

So I'll remember what it's like to be brothers again?

You know what, let her go.

Let her tell everyone that vampires

have returned to Mystic Falls.

Let them chain me up,

and let them drive a stake through my heart,

because at least I'll be free of you.

Huh.

Huh.

Wow.

Come here, sweetheart.

No! It's ok.

What happened?

Where am I?

Oh, I ripped my stitches open.

Ah...

You ok?

I took some pills, man.

I'm good.

It's good to be home.

Think I might stay a while.

This town could use a bit of a wake-up call,

don't you think?

What are you up to, Damon?

That's for me to know and for you to... dot dot dot.

Give Elena my best.

She said you found her wandering around.

Yeah.

So, um,

thanks.

Uhh, it's just so much drama.

Ever notice how the druggies

are the biggest attention whores?

Yeah.

Excuse me. hi.

Hi. Um, have you guys seen Elena?

I think she went home.

I'm gonna give you

Elena's cell number and her email.

She is big on texting,

and you can tell her...

I said so.

Thank you.

You ok?

What happened to you?

That's so rude.

I'm sorry. Excuse me.

Yeah, she kind of wigs out.

It's like her thing.

Jer?

N, it's me, the hypocrite patrol.

What are you doing?

I've become my worst nightmare.

The authority figure

who has to violate a 15-year-old's privacy.

Jackpot.

I see the hiding places ven't
gotten any more creative.

What brought
this on?

Your ass-hat of a history teacher
shamed me good yesterday.

You got tannered. Been there.

"Discover the impossible, Ms. Summers." Got it.

Thanks. Like I didn't know I was screwing up.

You're not screwing up, aunt Jenna.

Yes, I am.

You know why?

Because I'm not her.

She made everything look so easy.

You know, high school, marriage, having you.

I can't do it.

I'm gonna say or do the wrong thing,

and he's gonna get worse,
and it's gonna be my fault.

It's impossible.

This is just the fear talking.

You're a little scared,

that's all.

We all are.

I have to go do something.

But are you going to be ok?

Oh... whoo.

Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

No, it's fine.

Um... I was hoping I'd see you again.

I know.

Cocky much?

Very much.

Hi.

Hey.

* Something always brings me back to you *

Would you like to come in?

* You never take... *

The comet's actually this way.

* No matter what I say or do *

* Still feel you here *

* Till the moment I'm gone *

Sorry for barging in.

Especially after earlier.

No, no. I'm glad you're here.

The way we left things... I didn't like it.

See, the thing is,

I got home tonight planning on doing what I always do,

write in my diary,

like I have been since my mom
gave me one when I was 10.

It's where I get everything out, everything I'm feeling.

It all goes in this little book

that I hide on the second shelf

behind this really hideous ceramic mermaid.

But then I realized that I'd just be writing things

that I should probably be telling you.

What would you write?

I would write...

"Dear diary,

today I convinced myself it was ok to give up.

Don't take risks.

Stick with the status quo.

No drama, now is just not the time.

But my reasons aren't reasons, they're excuses.

All I'm doing is hiding from the truth,

and the truth is that..."

* Set me free *

I'm scared, Stefan.

I'm scared that if I let myself

be happy for even one moment that...

the world's just going to come crashing down,

and I...

I don't know if I can survive that.

* so talk *

Do you want to know what I would write?

* But you're onto me *

"I met a girl.

We talked.

It was epic."

* I live here on my knees *

"But then the sun came up and reality set in."

* Everything I think need here on the... *

"Well, this is reality.

Right here."

*I can't seem to let you go *

* The one thing that I still know *

* Is that you're keeping me *

* down *

* ooh *

* You're keeping me down *

* yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

* You're onto me *

* Onto me *

*All over *

Aah!

Good morning.

Please...

Don't.

Don't do that.

Ah, ah, ah.

No! No!

No!

Get away from me! No!

This could have gone a completely different way.

I'm not saying don't date the guy.

I'm just saying take it slow.

You were the one who said to go for it.

Now I'm saying take it slow.

Why the about-face?

It's not an about-face.

You're single for the first time

In your entire high school career.

It's the perfect time to play the field.

Oh, because I'm so that girl.

Seriously, what are you not saying?

It's stupid.

Bonnie...

What?
Spit it out.

I accidentally touched Stefan

And got a really bad feeling.

Is that it?

Bonnie.

It was bad bad!

Is the whole witch mojo thing again?

You know what? I'm just concerned.

This is me expressing concern

About my best friend's new boyfriend.

And I love you for it, I do.

But I feel good.

It's been a hard year,

and I'm starting to kind of feel like

things are getting back to normal again.

And you know what? Stefan is a big part of that.

I rock. I scored 2 tickets

to the Posers Saturday night.

They're playing at the rat.

You and tyler have fun.

Don't be like that.

Come on. I want you to go.

You're not worried everyone's going to know

you're screwing the stoner geek?

Oh, wait... everyone already knows.

Yeah. But it's not like that anymore,

so now we can be friends and just hang.

Tell me something, was it the drugs?

Were you sleeping with me because of the drugs?

Screw you.

No, if there's another reason,

please, I'm all ears.

Good morning, Elena.

Good morning, Bonnie.

Hey, um, I gotta find Caroline.

She's not answering her phone.

So I'll see you guys later.

Bonnie, wait...

She doesn't like me very much.

She doesn't know you.

She's my best friend. She's just looking out for me.

But when she does,

she will love you.

Look... 

there's Elena and her new boyfriend.

Now, what are they doing?

Oh, they're walking,

walking, walking.

Yep. Right into the sunset.

You're a dick.

While you just stand there
looking like one of those

little yard trolls.

Gnomes.

Here's what we're going to do.

Are you free tonight?

Yes.
Perfect.

Dinner, my house. 8:00.

You, me, and Bonnie.

You two will spend some quality time

and she'll get to see what a great guy you are.

Mission accomplished.

Hey, what am I supposed to do, Ty?

She made her choice.

Let her know she made the wrong one.

What are you doing?

Ty, don't.
Ty, don't!

Ty! Don't!

That throw was insane.

I didn't know you played football.

I used to. It was a long time ago.

So why don't you try out for the team?

Yeah, I don't think so.

So you don't like football?

No, I love football. I think it's a great sport.

But in this case,

I don't think football likes me.

You saw Tyler over there,

and we both know how Matt feels.

They don't know you.

To them, you're mysterious loner guy.

Wouldn't hurt to be part of.

Make some friends.
Says the girl

who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.

Hey, come on. There's more to me than just

gloomy graveyard girl.

There's a whole other Elena
that you have yet to meet.

She was into everything, very busy.

Well, I look forward to meeting her.

And when will that be?

Soon.

She's working on it.

World war II ended in...

Anyone got anything?

Miss Juan? 1945.

Psst. Fyi... 

Our team sucks. They could use you.

Can't.
Pearl Harbor.

I'm a loner.

Miss Gilbert?

Hmm? Pearl Harbor?

Um...

December 7, 1941.

Thank you, Miss Gilbert.

Anytime.

Very well.

The fall of the Berlin wall.

1989.

I'm good with dates, sir.

Are you?

How good?

Keep it to the year.

Civil Rights Act.

1964.

John F. Kennedy assassination.

1963.

Martin luther King.
'68.

Lincoln.
1865.

Roe vs. Wade.
1973.

Brown vs. Board.

1954.

The battle of Gettysburg.

1863.

Korean war.

1950 to 1953.

Ha! It ended in '52.

Uh, actually, sir,

it was '53.

Look it up, somebody.

Quickly.

It was 19... 53.

How did you know all of that?

Years and years of crossword puzzles.

It's a loner thing.

Nice job! Nice job!

Mr. Lockwood, is there
anything you're good at?

'Cause it isn't history,

and it sure as hell isn't defending the ball!

Yes, coach.

Now do it again!

Oh, my God! You're here!

Yep. I can't be sad girl forever.

The only way to get things back to the way they were

are to do things that were.

Oh, and you're coming to dinner tonight.

I am?
Mm-hmm.

You and me and Stefan.

You have to give him
a chance.

Tonight's no good.

Have you seen caroline?

I texted her like a hundred times.

Don't change the subject, Bonnie Bennett.

You're going to be there.

Fine. I'll go.

Good.

Varsity trials were last spring, Mr. Salvatore.

I wasn't
here then, sir.

And you're not here now, as far as I'm concerned.

Mr. Tanner, I realize that you and I

didn't get off to the best start,

And I want to apologize for that.

I've played football before.

Wide receiver, mostly, and I'm pretty good.

Well, I won't be asking you
who won the super bowl in '71.

'71 was the...

Sorry. I... I understand that, sir.

Just to see you get knocked on your ass.

Borrow some gear.

Go!

Before I change my mind. Let's run it again!

First my girlfriend, now the team?

Dude, this is an opportunity.

Football's a contact sport.

Sometimes people get hurt.

Whoo!

Ha ha!

Seriously, where is caroline?

I don't know. It's not like her.

Try her again.

Uh...

Oh, my God.

That must be the mystery guy from the grill.

That's not a mystery guy.

That's Damon Salvatore.

Salvatore, as in Stefan?

I got the other brother.

Hope you don't mind.

Sorry I'm late, girls.

I, uh, was busy.

All right, let's start with the
double pike herkey hurdler,

what do you say?

And 5, 6, 7, 8.

1, 2, 3, 4,

5, 6, 7, 8.

1, 2, 3, 4,

5, 6, 7, 8.

Elena, sweetie, why don't you just observe today?

Ok?

Keep going! Ok. Do it again from the top.

And 5, 6, 7, 8.

1, 2, 3, 4,

5, 6, 7, 8.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

7, 8.

Blue lady!

Blue lady!

Set, hut! Go!

Come on, Tyler, cover it!

Let's do it.

Get it.

Line up!

I hate to say it, but he's got skills.

I think he needs a buddy pass.

Really?

You don't get to walk on the field

And act like you own the place after 5 minutes.

Just hang one up there
and I'll take care of the rest.

Do it again.

All right, let's huddle up.

Set, hut!

Oh!

Whoo!

Welcome to the team, buddy.

Let's go.

You gonna live, Salvatore?

Yeah.

Walk it off, son.

Hey. That was my bad.

It's all right.

Hey.

All right.

How were tryouts?

Did you make the team?

Very Emerson, the way you reveal
your soul with so many... 

Adjectives.

What are you doing here?

I've come to apologize.

I've been doing some thinking,

some soul searching, and...

I want us to start over.

We need to put the past behind us.

You're my little brother,

and if you want to live

a normal, happy human life,

Then I want that for you.

Maybe I can do it, too.

That I can learn to be a non-living

living person.

Maybe there's hope for both of us.

You know, it doesn't have to be this way, Damon.

Of course it doesn't.

I saw Elena today, btw.

That means "by the way."

She was at cheerleading practice.

She looked so perky in her little short shorts.

Just...

simmer down, I didn't even go near her.

I've got my own cheerleader now.

Ooh, that reminds me... 

I gotta run. I have a date.

Sweaty palms.

Wish me luck.

You explain it.

Last night, I'm watching Nine-o,

a commercial breaks come on and I'm like,

I bet it's that phone commercial. And sure enough,

it's that guy and the girl with the bench,

he flies to Paris and he flies back.

They take a picture. Oh, come on.

That commercial's on a constant loop.

Fine.

Well, how about this?

Today I'm obsessed with numbers.

3 numbers. I keep seeing 8, 14, and 22.

How weird is that?

Maybe we should play the lottery.

Have you talked to your grams?

She's just gonna say it's because I'm a witch.

I don't want to be a witch. Do you want to be a witch?

I don't want to be a witch.

And putting it in a nice bowl

isn't fooling anybody.

Ok, serving spoons.

Where are the serving spoons?

Little drawer on your left.

Ok, so you've been in this
kitchen like a thousand times.

Yeah, that's it.

Ok, he's here.

Don't be nervous. Just be your normal loving self.

Birthday candles.

Did tanner give you a hard time today?

Well, he let me on the team,

so I must have done something right.

Bonnie, you should have seen Stefan today.

Tyler threw a ball right at him, and... 

Yeah, I heard.

Why don't you tell Stefan about your family?

Um, divorced. No mom. Live with my dad.

Hmm.

No, about the witches.

Bonnie's family has a lineage of witches.

It's really cool.

Cool isn't the word I'd use.

Well, it's certainly interesting.

I'm not too versed,

But I do know that there's

A history of celtic druids

that migrated here in the 1800s.

My family came by way of Salem.

Really?

Salem witches?

Yeah.

I would say that's pretty cool.

Really? Why?

Salem witches are heroic examples

of individualism

and nonconformity.

Yeah, they are.

I wonder who that could be.

Surprise!

Bonnie said you were doing dinner,

so we brought dessert.

Oh. Hope you don't mind.

What are you doing here?

Waiting for Elena to invite me in.

Oh, yeah, you can... 
No, no, no.

He can't, uh...

he can't stay.

Can you, Damon?

Get in here.

We're just... finishing up.

It's fine. Just come on in.

You have a beautiful home, Elena.

Thank you.

I cannot believe that Mr. Tanner let you on the team.

Tyler must be ceiling.

But good for you. Go for it.

That's what I always tell him. You have to engage.

You can't just sit there and
wait for life to come to you.

You have to go get it.

Yeah, Elena wasn't so lucky today.

It's only because you missed summer camp.

God, I don't know how you're ever
going to learn the routines.

I'll work with her. She'll get it.

I guess we can put her in the back.

You know, you don't seem like

the cheerleader type, Elena.

Oh, it's just 'cause her parents died.

Yeah, I mean, she's just

totally going through a blah phase.

She used to be way more fun.

And I say that with complete sensitivity.

I'm sorry, Elena.

I know what it's like to lose both your parents.

In fact, Stefan and I have watched
almost every single person

we've ever cared about die.

We don't need to get into that right now, Damon.

Oh, you know what, you're right, Stef. I'm sorry.

The last thing I wanted to do was bring her up.

Mmm.

Don't do that.

Not while I'm working.

I'll see you later.

I'll be right back.

She's my sister and I love her,

but sometimes she can
really make you work for it.

I find it pretty easy.

All right, I get it. Hitting me to impress her. That's... 

That's real nice.

I don't need to impress her.

I already won.

Now you're dead.
Am I? 'Cause it seems like

I'm standing here waiting for you to man up.

Ty, don't!

The next time I see you, gilbert...

No, next time I see you.

What are you doin', Vick?

One more.

Oh, thank you.

Nice save.

I like you.

You know how to laugh.

And you make Stefan smile,

which is something I haven't seen

in a very long time.

Earlier, did you mean... Katherine?

Mm-hmm.

How did she die?

In a fire. Tragic fire.

Recently?

Well, it seems like it was yesterday.

What was she like?

She was beautiful.

A lot like you in that department.

She was just very complicated

and selfish and at times not very kind,

but very sexy and seductive.

So which one of you dated her first?

Nicely deduced.

Ask Stefan.

I'm sure his answer differs from mine.

I'd quit cheerleading if I were you.

Why do you say that?

Oh, I saw you at practice. You looked miserable.

You saw that?

Uh-huh.

I used to love it. It was fun.

Things are different this year.

Everything that used to matter doesn't anymore.

So don't let it.

Quit, move on. Problem solved.

Ta-da.

Some things could matter again.

Maybe.

But... seems a little unrealistic to me.

I'm sorry.

About Katherine.

You lost her, too.

Hey.

Need some help?

Sure, why not?

Matt tries, but he's just having a really hard time.

You have to understand that

they were each other's first.

You know, like, from the sandbox.

That's a really nice scarf.

Mm. Thank you, it's new.

Can I see it?

I mean, would you mind taking it off?

Oh, I can't.

Why not? You ok?

Um...

All I know is that I can't take it off.

What are you two kids talking about?

I was just commenting on her scarf.

Hmm. Hey, you know, um,

Elena and Bonnie are finishing up the dishes.

Why don't you go see if you can help?

Does it look like I do dishes?

For me?

Hmm... I don't think so.

Go see if Elena needs help in the kitchen.

You know what?

I'm gonna go see if Elena needs
some help in the kitchen.

Great.

They are people, Damon.

She's not a puppet.

She doesn't exist for your amusement,

for you to feed on whenever you want to.

Sure she does.

They all do.

They're whatever I want them to be.

They're mine for the taking.

All right, you've had your fun.

You used Caroline, you got to me and Elena,

good for you.

Now it's time for you to go.

That's not a problem.

Because...

I've been invited in,

and I'll come back tomorrow night

and the following night

and I'll do with your little cheerleader

whatever I want to do.

Because that is what is normal to me.

Tonight wasn't so bad. I had fun.

Hmm. That makes one of us.

Come on.

Your brother isn't as bad as you make him out to be...

There must be a shred of humanity
left inside my brother.

Somewhere.

I keep hoping.

But how do I make him see it?

And how do I protect her?

Ooh.

Look at you. You look hot in your jersey.

What happened? No more cheerleader?

I quit. I'm a quitter.

No, hey, you're not a quitter.

You suffered a great loss.
You're not the same person.

You should be looking ahead.

You should be starting over.

Ok?

I hope you don't think this is

too soon or too weird, but...

I, uh,

I wanted you to have this.

Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

It's something that I've had forever,

and, uh, I've never wanted to
give it to anyone until now.

I'd very much like it if you'd wear it for me,

for... good luck.

Is that rose that I smell?

No, it's, uh... it's an herb.

It's nice, huh?

I love it.

And, uh,

I wanted to thank you

for pushing me to try out for the team.

It feels really good.

We're a pair.

I quit, you start.

Right. 

We're a work in progress.

We'll figure it out.

And you're not in uniform because...

Wait, wait, wait,

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Wait. Let's be honest here.

In the past, we used to let other teams

come into our town and roll right over us!

But that is about to change.

We've got some great new talent

tonight starting on the offensive line,

and I'm gonna tell you right now,

it has been a long time

since I have seen a kid like this

with hands like these.

This blows.

He can't start the guy. He just got here.

That have been waiting for us

to put a check in the win column,

I have only one thing to say to you... 

Your Timberwolves are hungry.

Hey, you. What's wrong?

Nothing. And the central high lions

are what's for dinner!

Is that Jeremy?

Wait, no! Ty! No.

Oh, what do you care?

Don't look so down.

You can have her when I'm done.

Tyler, stop it!

Tyler! Tyler, stop!

Stop it!

Stop, you're hurting him!

Tyler!

Tyler, stop!

Tyler!

Stop it! Tyler, stop!

Hey, he's down! Enough!

Jeremy, no!

Get off me! Stop!

What the hell, Jeremy?

Put your head up, you're bleeding.

I'm fine!

Yeah, you smell fine.

Just stop, ok?

Come on, man. Come on.

Oh, my God, your hand.

No, no, no, it's fine.

Is it deep? How bad is it?

Come on!

But... I saw it, it was... 

He missed.

It's not my blood.

See? I'm fine.
No, no, no.

I... I saw it. The glass cut your hand. It was... 

It's ok. I'm ok.

It's almost kick-off time, all right?

So, um,

I'll, uh, I'll see you after the game.

Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly.

Can you stand straight, please?

Could someone please help Tiki?

Hey! Where you been?

Can I ask you a question

And you give me a really serious no-joke response?

Of course. What is it?

The bad mojo.

When you touched Stefan
and you had that reaction...

You know what, forget I said that.

Your little dinner party plot totally won me over.

No, Bonnie, seriously. What was it?

Did you see something,

Or...

it wasn't clear like a picture.

Like today, I keep seeing

those same numbers I told you about... 

8, 14, 22.

Yeah? When I touched Stefan,

it was a feeling.

And it vibrated through me,
and it was cold, and it... 

And what?

It was death.

It's what I imagine death to be like.

You scared me. What are you doing here?

I'm hiding from Caroline.

Aand why is that?

I needed a break.

She talks more than I can listen.

That could be a sign.

Well, she's awfully young.

Not much younger than you are.

I don't see it going anywhere in the bigger picture.

I think she'd drive me crazy.

Caroline does have

Some really annoying traits,

but we've been friends since the first grade

and that means something to me.

Duly noted. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable.

That's not my intention.

Yes, it is.

Otherwise you wouldn't
put an alternate meaning

behind everything you say.

You're right.

I do have other intentions, but so do you.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

I see 'em.

You want me.

Excuse me?

I get to you. You find yourself drawn to me.

You think about me even when you
don't want to think about me.

I bet you even dreamed about me.

And right now...

You want to kiss me.

What the hell?

I don't know what game you're
trying to play with Stefan here,

but I don't want to be part of it.

And I don't know what happened in the past,

but let's get one thing straight... 

I am not Katherine.

You gonna be able to play?

Oh, yeah, I'm good.

Uh, what you did back there...

you had Jeremy's back.

Ah, he's a messed-up kid.

Somebody's gotta look out for him.

I know.

This week at practice I was a dick.

Had your reasons.

No excuse.

Good luck tonight.

We're lucky to have you.

Isn't that nice?

Stefan joins a team, makes a friend.

It's all so, "rah, rah, go team, yeah!"

Not tonight.

I'm done with you.

Nice trick with Elena.

Let me guess... vervain in the necklace?

I admit, I was a bit surprised.

It's been a while since anyone
could resist my compulsion.

Where'd you get it?

Does it matter?

Guess I could just seduce
her the old-fashioned way.

Or I could just... eat her.

No.

You're not gonna hurt her, Damon.

No?

Because deep down inside,

there is a part of you

that feels for her.

I was worried that you had no humanity

left inside of you,

that you may have actually become the monster

that you pretend to be.

Who's pretending?
Then kill me.

Well, I'm... I'm tempted.

No, you're not.

You've had lifetimes to do it,

and yet, here I am. I'm still alive.

And there you are.

You're still haunting me.

After 145 years.

Katherine is dead.

And you hate me

because you loved her,

and you torture me because you still do.

And that, my brother,

is your humanity.

Salvatore!

What the hell? We've got a game to play!

If that's my humanity...

then what's this?

Aah!
No!

Anyone, anytime, any place.

Tanner's M.I.A. I think he had a little bit too much beer.

Don't talk to me right now,
all right? I'm pissed at you.

What's your problem?
What's my... 

You're my problem, all right?

You're a bully.

A freakin' 12-year-old bully, man.

And I'm sick of it.

I mean, what was that about tonight?

What's beating up the new guy going to prove?

Or screwing with my sister

or pummeling my girlfriend's kid brother.

Girlfriend? Look, I don't know how to tell you this,

but she dumped your ass.

Are you for real?! You want to hit me?

I'm on your team.

This was over the line.

Even for you.

Somebody help!

It wasn't just for the drugs.

What kind of animal could be doing all this?

Why would it come out of the woods

And attack someone in the middle of town?

I don't know.

I don't know.

I was so sure that you cut your hand.

I saw it.

I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine, ok?

We're fine.

That's what matters.

I thought there was hope

that somewhere deep inside,

something in Damon was still human,

Normal.

But I was wrong.

There's nothing human left in Damon.

No good, no kindness.

No love.

Only a monster

Who must be stopped.

For over a century I have
lived in secret,

Until now.
I know the risks,
but I have to know her.

I'm Elena.

I'm Stefan.
I'm Damon.

You didn't tell me
that you had a brother.

It's complicated.

Elena is a dead
ringer for Katherine.

Which one of you
dated her first?

Katherine is dead,
and you hate me

Because you loved her.

I was hoping
I'd see you again.

She's not a puppet.

She doesn't exist
for your amusement;

For you to feed on
whenever you want to.

They're whatever
I want them to be.

Wear it for me,
for...good luck.

You want to kiss me.

Vervain in the necklace.

It's been a while
since anyone could
resist my...compulsion.

There's nothing
human in Damon.

No good,
no kindness, no love.

Only a monster
who must be stopped.

Hello?

Jeremy?

Hello?

Man on tv:
this is logan fell
coming to you live

From the streets
of Mystic Falls

With breaking news
of another deadly
animal attack.

The wild animal terrorizing
the citizens of Mystic Falls

Has claimed another victim,

Local high school student
Elena gilbert.

Police are certain
that forensic eviden
will confirm

That this is the same animal
responsible for recent attacks.

You know
it's coming next.

Jeremy!

Ah!

Bad dream?

Ah.

Do you know how easy it was
to get into your head just now?

You really need
some human blood.

It might even
the playing field.

Football reference.

Too soon.

All right,
I deserved that.

But I just wanted
to let you know,

They caught the culprit.

The animal responsible
for killing coach tanner
and all those people.

What are you
talking about?

It was a mountain lion.
Really big one.

It attacked
a hunter this morning.
It's all over the news.

"Deadly beast captured.

All's well
in Mystic Falls."

Why would you
cover your tracks?

I've decided
to stay a while.

I'm just having
way too much fun here
with you and Elena.

Can't touch her now.

Well, the vervain
keeps me

Out of her head.

Maybe that's not
my target.

Believe it or not,
Stefan, some girls
don't need my persuasion.

Some girls just can't
resist my good looks,

My style and my charm

And my unflinching ability

To listen
to taylor swift.

This is john varvatos, dude.

Dick move.

I can confirm
that a 12-Foot
puma mountain lion

Attacked a hunter
and was subsequently
shot and killed.

The hunter is in
stable condition.

The real animal
is still out there,

Waiting for me,
challenging me
to fight back,

To stop him.

But how do I stop a monster
without becoming one myself?

To repeat, the animal
terrorizing Mystic Falls
has been caught.

Scum ball.

Scum bucket.

Who are you talking to?

Him.

The news guy, also known
as logan "scum" fell.

Did your mom ever
tell you why I moved
away from Mystic Falls?

Oh, no way.

You and him?

This is logan fell.

He's cute.

He is not cute.

There's nothing cute
about him.

What are you doing
with that?

I went yesterday and got it
from the safe deposit box.

Mom had told mrs. Lockwood
she would loan it

To the founder's council
for their heritage display.

Is that grandma
beth's wedding ring?

Originally it was
great-Great-Grandma mary's
wedding ring.

How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

You know, like on ebay?

You're not gonna find out.

That stuff is mom
and dad's. You can't
just give it away.

I'm not giving it away.

It's called a loan, jeremy.
[Doorbell rings]

Hi.

Hi.

Are you ok?

I'm good.

Sorry.

Maybe we should
press pause.

Yeah, you're probably right.

That was getting a bit...

Yeah.
Yeah.

How do you look
in a suit?

I can pull one off.
How about tomorrow night?

Will you be my date
to the founder's party?

They still do that?

Have you been before?

No, the salvatores

Don't get
invited anymore.

Well, this year,
there's this
heritage project

That meant a lot to my mom.

She was really involved
in the founder's council,

And it was
her favorite party.

I know it sounds
really boring, but--

I would be honored
to accompany you,

Miss gilbert.

The pleasure is all mine,
mr. Salvatore.

No yellow. Jaundice.
Go for the blue.

I don't like the blue.

Well, I do.

And if I'm gonna
be your date--

You cannot be my date.

My mother is going
to be there,

And she is a very proud
gun owner.

I went through
a lot of trouble

To make sure this party
wasn't cancelled.

It's very important
I be there.

Please take me.

You should come
to the founder's
party with me.

Not if you're wearing
that dress.

At's so special
about this bella girl?

Edward's so whipped.

You gotta read
the first book first.

It won't make sense
if you don't.

Ah, I miss anne rice.
She was so on it.

How come
you don't sparkle?

Because I live in
the real world,

Where vampires
burn in the sun.

Yeah, but you go
in the sun.

I have a ring.
It protects me.

Long story.

Will these bites
turn me into a vampire?

It's more
complicated than that.

You'd have to feed
on my blood, then die,

Then feed on a human's,
whole ordeal.

This book, by thwawa
has it all wrong.

You can be very sweet
when you want to be.

Yes, I can be sweet.

Are you going to kill me?

Mm-Hmm.

But not yet.

Why not?

Because there's
something I need you
to do for me.

Anything.

How good are you
at getting
this little nose

Where it doesn't
belong?

Oh, I'm excellent.

Mmm.

So what happens
with the season?

One big forfeit?
Are they looking
for a new coach?

I don't know, dad.

I doubt anybody's
thinking about that right now.

Charles,
founder's party, focus.

How are y'all
doing over here?

Ah, we're doing
great, sweetheart.

Is there anything else
I can get you?

We're fine, thanks.

Just the check, honey.

Here you go,
mayor lockwood.
Thanks.

You're taking Damon
to the founder's
party? What about me?

Go with Elena.

She's asking Stefan.

Ok, go by yourself.

Gee, thanks.
What about your mom?

Is she ok with you
bringing Damon?

And I'm supposed to care why?

He's older
sexy danger guy.

Older sexy danger guy?

Is that an official
witch twitter tweet?

No more
witch jokes, ok?

At whole mr. Tanner
prediction thing
has me freaked.

Ok.

And Damon's not dangerous.

You know, he just
has a lot of issues
with his brother.

You know, like major,
deep-Rooted drama.

Like...?

I'm not really supposed
to say anything.

Caroline forbes,
when have you ever kept
a secret in your life?

Ok.

But you can't tell Elena.

No.

So what you
gonna buy me?

Ugh, some class.

Oh, your parents are gone.
I guess  can bebclose now.

What the hell
does that mean?

You treat me like trash.
I'm sick of it.

I don't think
you're trash.

Really?
Then who are you taking

To the founder's party?

Vicki donovan.

Do you want me
to ask you to
the founder's party?

No.

It'll be stupid and lame.

True.

But it'll be less
stupid and lame
if you were there.

You realize
you had to ask him
to ask you, right?

You figure
if you dress up like

A respectable
young lady,

He'll finally
treat you like one?

Screw you, jeremy.

You know you're making
the wrong choice,

Yet you make it anyway.

It's sad.

I didn't know
you were here.

Just going through
Stefan's homework.

Boy, this country
sure has dumbed down

In the last
hundred years.

Why he wants
to go to high school
is beyond me.

I mean, in the seventies,
he went ivy league.

Harvard, I understood.

Actually, no. I didn't
get that either.

Go ahead, purge.

Get it out.
What's on your mind?

Why are you here, Damon?

To spend time
with you, zach.

Family's important.

I know you.

You always have a motive.

So tell me,
what is it this time?

You are in no position
to question me.

I didn't
mean to upset you.

This is not
upset, zach.

What's going on?

Having a family
moment, Stefan.

Spending some
quality time.

Hey, are you ok?

No, I'm not.

And neither are you.

How many more people
have to die before
you see that?

I see it.
All right, zach, I see it.

Then why aren't you
doing anything about it?

I can't, zach.

I can't.

It would take human blood.

It's the only way
that I could stop him,
and I can't do that.

The vervain
could weaken him

If he ingested it.

It would help get you
the upper hand.

Vervain hasn't grown here
since 1865.

Damon saw to that.

The little I had,
I gave to Elena.

What?

You've been
growing it.

It's just something
that's been passed down
through the generations.

Blood only runs
so deep when you're
related to vampires.

Damon would
kill me if he knew
that I had it.

But you're telling me.

Why?

Because I trust you.

And you're gonna
need it if you want
to get rid of him.

I'm here for my mom.
I was supposed to pick
up a box of stuff.

Right here.

Please be careful.

Yeah,  careful
with it, dick.

Hey! Not now,
ok, guys? Please?

I'm fine. He's just
being a punk.

I got your punk.
Look, Tyler,

Maybe you should go.
Tell your mom that
I'll see her tonight.

Hey.

Would it make
a difference

If I told you
I actually like vicki?

Not even if you meant it.

Delicate flower
vs. Naughty vixen.

Tough call.
Can we mix them?

Look at you,
getting all pretty
for your date.

You seem happy-Ish.

I am...ish.

Tonight's going
to be a good night.

But don't let that
stop you

From telling me
whatever it is

You wanted to tell
me as soon as you
walked in the door.

What if I tell you
in the morning?

I don't want
to ruin the night.

Bonnie, out with it.

Ok, but it has to go
in the vault,

Because Caroline
will kill me

If it gets back to Damon
that she squealed.

Apparently Stefan has
a very interesting back story.

Uh-Huh.

Do you know what happened
with his ex-Girlfriend
Katherine?

I know that
they both dated her

And that's why
they have issues.

Yeah, they both dated her,
only she chose Damon.

And that drove Stefan mad,
he did horrible things

To try and break them up.

He manipulated Katherine.

He filled her head
with all these lies
until finally

It worked,
and she turned against Damon.

That sounds like
one person's side
of the story,

Meaning Damon's.

I just wanted you to know.

Anyway, his past
relationships

Are none of my business.

Unless he's a calculating,
manipulative liar.

That is your business.

Stefan is none
of those things.

Yeah? How do you know?

Do they still wear ties
at this thing?

Why are you
even going?

It's only
fitting.

We were at the very
first one, remember?

I think it's better
if we don't draw
attention to ourselves.

So you should
stay here.

I'll see to it
Elena has a good time.

My goodness,
I've driven you
to drink.

Can't seem
to rid myself of you.

What else am I
supposed to do,

Besides go about
living my life?

Go about living
my life.

See, therein lies
your eternal struggle.

You're dead, dude.

Get over it.

What do you think?

Hello?

Hi, mrs. Lockwood.

What do you mean? It is?

Are you sure?

'Cause I saw it.

Let me check.

Mm-Hmm.

I will find it
and bring it.

Ok. Bye.

What's wrong?

Ahh! God, what now?

The pocket watch.
Where is it?

What watch?

The one you stole
from mom's box.

Look, mrs. Lockwood
just called me,
freaking out.

It was on the list,
jeremy.

And she can't find it,
and she thinks she's
the one who lost it.

Maybe she did.
Maybe Tyler took it.

Don't even play that card.
Jeremy, you took it.

If I go online, am I going
to find it on ebay?

Is that how you pay
for your pot?

Screw you.

I would never sell this, ok?

Then why did you
take it?

Because it's supposed
to be mine.

Dad said it goes
to the firstborn son.

His father gave it to him,
and now what?

And he was going
to give it to you.

Yeah.

Look, jeremy,
it's still yours, ok?

Mom promised mrs. Lockwood.

What do you want me to do?

Just take it
and get out.

It's cool
not growing old.

I like being
the eternal stud.

Yes, being
a 150-Year-Old teenager

Has been the height
of my happiness.

You cracked
a funny, Stefan.

I should have a drink
to celebrate.

1864.

You and Katherine
were the perfect couple.

It was hell watching you
dance with her.

My happiness was short-Lived,
as you well know.

I remember.

I left the party early,
I was waiting for her.

The night you dropped
her off, I was
waiting just inside.

You were such
a gentleman,

Gave her a kiss
on the cheek.

And what she really
wanted was...

Oh, well.

Here's to history
repeating itself, huh?

I admire
your effort, Stefan.

Pouring yourself a drink

Then spiking the bottle
with vervain.

I'm not some drunk
sorority chick.

You can't roofie me.

But I can't help
but feel a little used.

I thought we were
having a moment.

I have to go
to the party angry.

Who knows
what I'll do?

Hi, nice to see you.

Hi.
How are you?

Uh, let's go this way.

Why?

Line's too long.

We can go around back.

Come on,
party's in the back.

That was his favorite scotch.

I'm sorry,
I thought it would work.

I wasn't
counting on it.

You knew it would fail?

Did what I wanted.

It lowered
his guard.

You won't expect me
to try again so soon.

I doubled what
I put in the scotch.

Caroline!

You look smashing.

Thank you,
mrs. Lockwood.

This is my boyfriend
Damon.

Oh, well,
come on in.

Lovely to meet you.

I've been looking forward
to this party for quite a while.

Well, enjoy.

Wait here.

Really, you couldn't
even change out of
the badge for this?

I'm working, honey.

Who's the date
you just tried
to sneak past me?

Just some guy.

He's a little
old for you,
don't you think?

Oh, 'cause otherwise
you'd approve.

Yeah, I doubt that.

Hi, mayor lockwood.

Hey. Hey, guys,
come on in.

Thank you.

Where's your dad?

Memphis.
Good.

With stephen.

Your parents?

There's a lot of history here.

Jenna.

It's good to see you.

I thought
I might see you here.

You knew it.

I dreaded.

But were secretely
hoping.

And now that I have...

Whoa, hey, not so fast.

I know you. You have
a lot more insults
in you, I can tell.

Your hairline's receding.

No, it's not.
You want to have lunch?

Nope.
You haven't
changed a bit.

Oh, yes, I have.

I'm meaner now.

"The founding families
in Mystic Falls welcomes you

To the inaugural
founder's council
celebration."

Wow, look,
it's the original
guest registry.

Look at all these
familiar names--

Sheriff william forbes,

Mayor benjamin lockwood.

Is that Damon Salvatore?

And, look,
Stefan Salvatore.

The original
Salvatore brothers.

Our ancestors.
Tragic story, actually.

We don't need to
bore them with stories
of the past.

It's not boring,
Stefan.

I'd love to hear more
about your family.

Well, I'm bored.
I want to dance.

And Damon won't
dance with me.

Mm-Mmm.

Could I just
borrow your date?

Oh, uh...

I n't really dance.
Oh, sure he does.

You should see him.

Waltz,
the jitterbug,
the moonwalk.

He does it all.

You wouldn't mind,
would you, Elena?

It's up to Stefan.

I want to apologize to you

For being such
a world-Class jerk

The other night
when I tried to kiss you.

There's no excuse.

My therapist says I'm...

Acting out,
trying to punish Stefan.

[Chuckles] for what?

It's all in the past.
I don't even want
to bring it up.

Let's just say that the men
in the Salvatore family

Have been cursed
with sibling rivalry.

And it all started
with the original
Salvatore brothers.

Damon told you
to ask me to dance.

Didn't he?

Now why uld he do that?

Would you like one?

Thank you.

Ok, just tell me
if you see my mom.

The Salvatore name
was practically royalty
in this town.

Until the war.
There was a battle here--

The battle
of willow creek.

Right.

I know, we talked
about it in class.

Confederate soldiers
fired on a church
with civilians inside.

What the history books
left out

Was the people
that were killed.

They weren't there
by accident.

They were believed to be
union sympathizers.

So some of the founders
on the confederacy side
back then

Wanted them rounded up
and burned alive.

Stefan and Damon
had someone they loved

Very much
in that church.

And when they went
to rescue them,

They were shot.

Murdered
in cold blood.

Who was in the church
that they wanted to save?

A woman, I guess.

Doesn't it always
come down

To the love
of a woman?

Look, I'm sorry
that you and Stefan

Have this thing between you,

But I can't get in
the middle of it, Damon.

I just...

I hope you two
can work it out.

I hope so, too.

So you want to dance?

Me dancing?

Not pretty.

Maybe you could
show me around.

I mean,
this place is amazing.

Yeah, if you like
living in a museum.

Maybe I should just
strip naked

And give pastor bill
a lap dance.

I mean, that's why
we're hiding in a corner
all night, isn't it?

You're scared of how
I'm going to act?

You afraid of what
your parents are going
to think about your date

From the wrong side
of the tracks?

I don't care about
what they think.

Great. Let's go say hi.

Knock it off, vick.

Or we could just,
you know, sneak up
to your bedroom.

As long as nobody
sees us, right?

Vicki, I swear...
what's a matter, Ty?

You scared to stand up
to your mommy?

It's pretty pathetic.

Let go!
Tyler...

We didn't get a chance
to say hello earlier.

It's vicki, right?
Matt's sister.

Yes, ma'am.

You'll have to forgive
my son's rudeness.

He gets it
from his father.

Well, that's ok,
mrs. Lockwood.

Tyler and I were just
saying good night.

That's what you get
when you bring the trash
into the party.

What'd we miss?

We were just chatting.

Drink, Damon?

No, thanks,
I'll pass.

Stefan, do you have
another dance in you?

Absolutely.

They look so cute
together.

Don't talk, please.

Don't shoot!

I'm going to need
a refill.

Shooting implies caring.

Feigned indifference.
I like it.

I'm over the banter, logan.

I'd really rather
you just left me alone.

I'm sorry, Jenna.

About your sister.

Thank you.

Came to the funeral.

I know.

I saw you.

Yeah, I didn't want
to push my way in,

But I wanted to be
there for you.

And when I heard
you were staying
in Mystic Falls,

I thought maybe...

Well, maybe I could
have a second chance
to make things right.

Her name was Monica,
wasn't it?

I hope Damon didn't
drive you too crazy.

No, actually,
he was on good behavior.

He even apologized

and explained why he is
the way he is.

And it all goes back
to Katherine.

Hmm.

So tell me about her.

What happened?

It's not something
I like to talk about.

I get that. I do.

I just want you to
know that you can.

I mean, I burden you
with all of my drama,

And I want you
to do the same.

I know.

Thank you.

The truth is, Stefan...

I don't really know
that much about you,

And I'd really love it
if you would open up to me.

Damon said something,
didn't he?

He likes to play games
and cause trouble, Elena.

This isn't about Damon,
it's about me trying
to get to know you.

Look, you're the mystery guy,
and I like that.

But with mystery
comes secrets,

And this thing with Katherine.

Let it go.
I don't want
to talk about it.

Well, then, say something
about yourself. Anything.

Otherwise, I'm left
with nothing but what
other people tell me.

Don't you see what
Damon has done here?

He's trying to get you
to turn against me.

Well, then I guess
it's working.

This is my fault.
I planted doubt.

I'm a doubt planter.

It's not your fault.

I just--
I feel terrible

Because I said that
I wouldn't get in
the middle of it,

And that's exactly
what I did.

I got all snotty.

Elena, honey,
there you are.

I notice the watch
still isn't in
the collection.

Oh, um, I'm sorry,
mrs. Lockwood.

I, um, I couldn't find it.

I guess it's still
packed up in my parents'
stuff somewhere.

I see.

Well, please
let me know
if you do find it.

Ok.

Where have you been?

Ah.

Looking for you.

Your brother barely
danced with me
for five minutes--

Ok, just a minute.
Stand right...there.

Um, you're not
supposed to touch.

What is that?

It's a very important crystal.

Well, how did you know
that it was there?

Because I put it there.

When?
A long time ago.

Tonight, I'm taking it back,
thanks to you.

Well, what's it for?
Never you mind.

You can't just steal it.

It's not stealing
if it's mine.

Come on.
Well...

Vodka tonic.

Ok, I know that this
is probably going
to be strike 3,

But I hope
you can see it
for what it is.

And what is it?
Persistence.

Groveling, commitment.
Take your pick.

I fled town
because of you.

Fled.

I was young and stupid,

And then things changed.

Life got...real.

You'd know that better
than anyone.

Hypothetically speaking,
if allowed,

How would you
make things right?

Well, more groveling,
of course.

A recap of the past
few years spent
soul searching.

Cheese fries.

Obvious.

I know my audience.

Yes to lunch. Call me.

Look around.
What's missing?

The flames, the candles.

Why aren't they lit?

There's matches
in the kitchen.

Bitch.

Hey.

Hey.

So how are things
with Stefan?

Great. Just great.

Really?

Well, my radar
must be off,

'Cause I was
getting all sorts
of other vibes,

What is that?

Hmm?

Don't!

Oh god, Caroline,
what happened?

Nothing, ok?!

That is nothing.
Did somebody hurt you?

No, ok, nothing.

It just...

My mom would kill me.

Did Damon hurt you?

No! Of course not!

Just leave me alone,
ok, Elena?!

God!

There is something
seriously wrong with you.

You stay away
from Caroline or I will
go straight to her mother,

The sheriff. You got it?

Stay away from her.

I'm sorry.

I take it all back.

You're completely
right about Damon.

What did he do?

There are bruises

All over
Caroline's body.

Bite marks,
and he has her
all confused

And messed up
in the head.

You don't look
surprised.

Um...

I'm handling it.

Handling it?

Stefan, you should be
having him arrested.

Elena, please.

I...

I don't expect you
to understand.

I don't understand
anything, Stefan.

So why don't you just
clear it up for me?

Look, there are things
that you don't know, ok?

Things that I want
to tell you, but I can't.

And I may never
be able to.

And I just need you
to trust me.

Trust is earned.

I can't justagically
hand it over.

I'm so sorry.
I have to go.

You look amazing.
What are you doing here?

I was thinking maybe
I could make one more
wrong choice today.

I still have 17 minutes.

Don't!

She took it off and I
got flustered, ok?!

I didn't know
what to say.

But I swear, ok, I did
not tell her.

I just told her that you
didn't mean to hurt me.

You make me crazy,
you know that?

It's ok.
I forgive you.

I swear I didn't say--

Shh, shh, shh.

Unfortunately...

I am so over you now.

What the hell?

You know, I couldn't
spike your drink...

So I spiked hers.

Caroline?

There you are.

I've been looking
everywhere for you.

Are you ok?

Yeah. I'm fine.

Caroline,
what happened?

I'm fine.

No.

You're shaking.
Caroline--What--
I'm fine!

Caroline, come here,
come here.

I did
what I had to do...

To protect Elena,
to protect everyone.

Yes, Damon,
the headline reads

"Deadly beast captured.

All is well
in Mystic Falls."

Thank you
for staying so late.

Did you get
the gilbert watch?

She claims it's packed away
in her parents' things.

I can get it.

Good. We're going
to need it.

Are you sure?

5 bodies
all drained of blood?

I'm certain.

They've come back.

<i>previously on vampire diaries
for over a century, i have lived in secret until now..</i>

I know the risk,
but i have to know her.

Caroline: how come
you don't sparkle?

Because i live
in the real world,

Vampes bin sun.
you go in the sun.

I have a ring.
it protects me.

The pocket watch. where is it?

It's supposed to be mine.

Did you get the gilbert watch?

I can get it.

Good. we're gonna need it.

Caroline:
what is that?

A very important crystal.

You're the mystery guy
and i like that.

But with mystery
comes secrets.

I just need you
to trust me.

Trust is earned.

Oh, my god, caroline,
what happened?

Nothing
did damon hurt you?!

There are bruises all over caroline.

I'm handling it.

Zach: the vervain
could weaken him

If he ingested it.
it would help get you
the upper hand.

I knew i couldn't
spike your drink,

So i spiked hers.

Five bodies
all drained of blood?

They've come back.

Damon:
where is my ring?

Won't be
needing it anymore.

[groans]

How long
have i been here?

Three days.

What are you doin'?

During the dark ages
when a vampire's actions

Threatened to expose
or bring harm upon
the entire race,

They would face
judgment.

They sought to reeducate them

Rather than
to punish them.

You know what
will happen if i don't...

Feed on blood.

You'll grow weaker and weaker.

Eventually
you won't be able
to move or speak.

In a week your skin
will desiccate,

And you'll mummify.

A living corpse.

Unable to hurt anyone.

Ever.

So what, you're just going
to leave me in the basement,

Forever?

I've injected you
with enough vervain
to keep you weak.

Once your circulation stops,

I'll move you
to the family crypt,
and then in 50 years,

We can reevaluate.

[strained chuckle]
i'm stronger than you think.

You always have been.

But you're not sntronger
than the vervain.

And we both know it.

I'm sorry.

Didn't have
to be this way.

I--i'm sorry,
i'm almost done.

It's--it's ok.
take your time.

[music playing]

I think you might be
in trouble.

What did you do?

Oh, she saw me.

I'm a drug-using delinquent.

A girl in bed
doesn't really rank.

Sorry.

Elena: jenna!

Are you aware of what's
going on upstairs?

Uh-huh.

And you have no objection?

He could be
craftier about it,

At least make an effort
to sneak her in and out.

Oh, and just so you know,

I won't be home
for dinner.

Oh, so you're actually
going to do it.

You're gonna go out with logan.

I'm going to show up
and torture him, yes.

[chuckles]

And have you heard
from stefan?

Not sinceft that
very vague message
three days ago.

"hi, um, elena,

"i, um, have something
i have to do.

I'll, uh, explain
in a few days."

Haven't you called him?
nope.

Not going to, either.

And you're ok
with eeverything?

No, i'm not ok
with any of it.

But i'm not gonna
cry about it, either.

You , i was going
to write in my diary
this morning

And then i thought,
what am i going to write?

Honestly, i'm not
gonna be onee of those pathetic girls

Whose world stops spinning
because of some guy.

Ok, then.

I'll be fine.

He's awake.

He's weak,
but it's probably best

To stay out of the basement.

He's damon. i'm not sure
how dangerous

He still might be.
you're going to school?

Came here to live a life.

It's about time
i get back to that.

And elena,
if she's still
speaking to me.

Why haven't you
called her?

Am suppose to do,
feed her another lie?

I hate lying to her, zach.
i'm not good at it.

She already thinks
i'm hiding something.

What choice
do you have?

You came here because you wanted to live
as normal a life as you could.

You knew this was going
to be a part of it.

Caroline:
i remember the party.

Damon came up
behind me,

And he was kissing
my neck,

Or biting my neck.

I passed out.

It's like there's holes in my memory lately.

It's just weird.

Maybe i let him bite me.

Why would you do that?

Can we just not
talk about it, ok?

Donn't want
to talk about damon.

I don't want
to talk about

Any of it.

Just want to go
back to normal.

What are you doing
with that candle?

Um...

Nothing.

What's this?

Damon gave it to me.

Or he was going to give it to me.

All i know is,

It's mine now.

It's ugly.

Well, get your hands off it.

Roline: the sexy suds
car wash is tomorrow.

The football team
and the band have committed.

Well, not all the band.

Just the ones who could pull off the bikini.

I want, in your face, sexy.

I mean, it's a fund raiser, for god's sake.

Unbelievable.

It's like nothing
happened.

Lies and denial.

Hey.

Hey. you know, i gotta go.

Be somewhere right now.

I'm so sorry
i haven't called.

No worries.

I'll live.

I was dealing with damon.

And did you...
deal with damon?

Yes. yeah.

For four days?

You have every right to be upset with me.

But can i explain it all to you?
please.

Sure. when?

I gotta be home after school, but

The grill, on four o'clock?

Ok.
thanks.

Stefan, where is damon?

He has some serious apologizing to do.

He's gone, caroline.

When is he coming back?

He's not coming back.

I'm sorry.

This is a good
thing, caroline.

I know that.

[indistinct chatter]

Hey, matt, um,

Have you seen stefan?

Nope
[sighs]

If you want
to kill some time,

Um, you can rack.

[chuckles]
come on.

We haven't played
in forever.

I'll let you brick.

[damon coughing]

I'm full of vervain.

I've been putting it
in my coffee for 16 years.

My blood will only
make you worse.

Damon?

So it was your vervain.
good for you.

Good for you.

Family only runs so deep.

[coughing]

We're not family,
damon.

Only in the most
dysfunctional sense.

In fact, i avoided having
a living, breathing,

Loving family
because of you.

I don't guess
i could talk you into

Bringing me a rabbit
or something?

I'd settle
for stefan's diet
at this point.

You know
i can't do that.

You succeeded, zach.

I'm shutting down.

[breathing heavily]

You're like
your grandfather.

He didn't like it when
i came to visit, either.

But you don't
visit, damon.

You appear, unannounced,

Reminding me that
this isn't my house;

That you're just
permitting me to live here.

Hell, that you're
permitting me to live.

Someone had
to mow the lawn.

[scoffs]

I came to say
good-bye, damon.

Unlock it.

Unlock the door, zach.

[groaning]

[grunting]

[damon coughing]

Keep it up, damon.

The more energy
you expend,

The faster you'll go.

And there's vicki,
all nonchalant
in the bathroom

Like it's no big deal
that they're hooking up.

Yeah, i'm not gonna lie.

Your brother
and my sister,
that's weird.

Yeah.

How late is he?

Hitting
the hour mark.

Hope there's
nothing wrong.

Which means i'm not
talking boy problems
with you.

Good.

I mean, it's not
like we were ever

Best friends
or anything.

[scoffs]

Ok.

Here goes--

What do you
think of stefan?

Is he a good guy?

Why? what's he done?

Not any one thing.

He's just so secretive
all the time.

I think there's something
that he doesn't want me to know,

Which makes me
want to know
all the more.

Like what? like that
he's a serial killer

And he keeps
a clown suit
in his trunk?

[chuckles] no,
of course not.

But what do we know
about him, really?

He's great
at football.

A little bit
of a loner.

And as much as
i hate saying it,

He might be
a nice guy.

So you think
i'm just being paranoid?

I think you should
talk to him.

Stefan: talk to who?

I'm so sorry
that i'm late.

What happened?

I got held up.

Is everything ok?

There was this thing
with my uncle.

And you couldn't call
and tell me that you were
going to be an hour late?

Ok. you two
have fun.

I'm really sorry.

It was unavoidable.

What was unavoidable?

[chuckles] ok.

Oh, uh, elena,
please...

No, stefan,
don't you get it?

Every question
gets a vague non-answer.

What is so awful
that you're afraid
to tell me?

Man: i know you.

My god.

I'm sorry?
i know you.

How can it be?

I think you have
the wrong person, sir.

You haven't aged a day.

I'm sorry. excuse me.

Hey, can we--
can i take you home

And we can talk
about it?

Is that ok?

Wait, what was that?

I--i don't know.
uh, nothing.

Right, nothing.
ok, um...

I gotta go, stefan.

Excuse me.

Elena: i tried.

I want so much
to make things right,

But every instinct
in my body

Is telling me
to be careful.

What you don't know
can hurt you.

Evening, sheriff.

Anything?

We went over the entire
west side of the lake.

All the caverns
by the falls were clean,

No signs of habitat.

Well, they're
staying in town.

We canvassed all
abandoned buildings
and warehouses.

There has to be
a private residence.

And that much harder
to locate, if not impossible.

These creatures are smart.
they know how to go undetected.

Well, someone who only
comes out at night

Should eventually
become obvious.

What about the watch?
i'm working on it.

I knew the gilberts.

That watch is passed down

To the men in the family.
i'd start with jeremy.

I can't believe
you really came.

You have an hour.

Make it count.

Jeremy: you ok?

Is vicki in there?

Don't answer a question
with another question.

Maybe.

What's wrong with you?

I'm miserable.

Well, you should go
gesomething to eat.

[water running]

Jenna?

[water stops]
jenna?

Stefan?

What are you
doing here?

Dinner.

Jeremy told me
that chicken parmesan
is one of your favorites,

And i happen to be
a good cook.

The italian roots
demand it.

I can even make
my own homemade mozzarella.

Only tonight,
it is unfortunately
storboboht.

Sorry.

I don't know
what you're trying
to accomplish.

You want to know me, right?

Well, i figure
if you're going
to dump me,

You should at least,
um, know who you're dumping.

So let's start
with katherine.

Stefan...

She was...the most
beautiful girl that
i had ever met.

She had this perfect
olive skin.

And she had this laugh.

It was ridiculous.

I mean, her laugh
made you laugh.

And she was fun.

She knew how to have
a good time.

But katherine was also
very impatient and entitled

And selfish, and, um,
and impulsive.

Enter damon.

He claims that he was
with her first.

I don't know.

I do know
that i did some things

That...i'm not proud of.

And my biggest regret...

Is not being able
to make it right
before she died.

I miss her, but...

I'm no longer crippled
by her loss.

Vicki: it was very nice
what you did for stefan.

Very romantic.

Well, i was feeling romantic.

Look what i found.

"elena gilbert,

"take one tablet
every 4 to 6 hours,

As needed for pain."

Those are left over
from the car accident.

So she won't
miss them.

Nonot with that,
that's an antique.

[sighs]

I feel like
we're always
getting high.

That's the beauty
of choice.

Well, then let's
choose not to.

I mean, we don't have to be
high all the time, right?

I really hope you're
not one of those guys

Who, now that
we're together,

Tries to change
everything about me.

No.

Good.

[music playing]

I'm an avid reader,
a huge fitzgerald fan,

<i>the great gatsby,
his masterpiece.</i>

But i'm no snob.
i love some good grisham.

<i>i think seinfeld 
is the best american
television show</i>

For the past 50 years,

<i>but i love lucy
is all-time.</i>

"the loving cup" episode
was the best, i think.

Huge scorsese fan.

<i>i can watch taxi driver 
over and over again.</i>

Here, let me.

As far as music,
it's pretty much
across the board.

Um, dylan, hendrix,
patsy, willie.

Oh, kanye. you know
what, i even like
that one miley song.

[scoffs]
easy.

I didn't say anything.

Hey, this is for
the garlic bread, right?

Because i'm not eating garlic
unless you agree to, too.

Are you kidding?
i love garlic.

[chuckles]

Ow! ahh.

You ok?
um...

Yeah. think so.

[water running]

Your face...

I--i, uh,

I think i got
something in my eye.

Stefan.

Hey.

Stefan!

[exhales]

[chuckles]

Um, i think
that my paranoia

Has turned into
full-blown hallucinations.

Part of your charm.

[music playing]

Caroline.

Caroline.

No, tiki, do not do
the one-piece, ok?

I've seen it on you.
trust me.

Yeah, but you're going
for stripper pole
vibe this year.

Caroline.

[caroline giggles]

Yeah, maybe we should wash
the cars in slow motion.

[chuckles] no.

Caroline.

What? oh, um,
no, sorry.

Um, so i'll just
see you tomorrow.

Two-piece. ok, bye.

[bird caws]

Shoo, shoo!

Shoo!

[caws]

God!

[breathing heavily]

Damon: i bet you're
feeling pretty good

About yourself,
aren't you?

Not particularly.

You won.

You got the bad guy.

Now nothing could come
between you and elena.

Except the truth.

The lies will catch up
to you, stefan.

As long as you keep
lying to yourself
about what you are.

The beauty of you
in there

And me out here...

Is that i can walk away.

[music playing]

No friend discounts.

No freebies.

No pay ya laters.

We are not running
a charity here.

No, we are not.
hi.

Hey!

The event is called
sexy suds, you know.

[music playing]

Stefan: did we just
get scolded?

And judged, yeah.

Wow.
i'm sorry,
but i guess

You're going to have
to take that off.

I think you have
to go first.

Ok.

[music playing]

Ok, um--sorry,

So not sexy.

Ugh.

[chuckles]

I disagree.

Bonnie:
uh-uh, no.

None of that
tortured
pining stuff.

I'm just observing.

Mm-hmm.

Oh.

Tiki. this one's yours.

Why do i always get
the homely os?

Just to be clear,
your car's a p.o.s.

I mean, we can wash it,
but it's still a p.o.s.

You don't have to be rude.

Rude is uglying up
the road
with that junk.

[squealing]

Whoa!

[squealing]

Whoa!

Wet and wild, tik.

Logan: all proceeds are
going to the school's
athletic department

Still healing
from the tragic death

Of their football coach
william tanner.

The citizens
of mystic falls

Coming together
in support of one
of their own.

Cut it.

Jenna: classy.

Thank you.

But you're still going to

Video the girls
in bikinis, right?

We, 53% of americans
watch the news
with the sound off.

[chuckles]

Thank you for dinner.

I had a nice time.

Do you remember
the last time

We were in the school
parking lot?

Nope.

Doesn't ring a bell.

<i>really?
nada.</i>

Especially not having sex
in the minivan.

That was a good day.

What?
[laughs]

You're getting
soap in that.

Oh, it's fine.

I noticed at damon
has one, too.

Is there a story
behind it?

Yeah, it's the family crest
from the italian renaissance.

Hmm.

What's the stone?

It's called
lapus lazuli.

Oh.

You should really
take it off.

I could put it
in my bag.

No, it's--
it's fine, really.

Thanks, though.

Ok.

I'm gonna get some towels.

Ok.

Hey, we're out of towels
and those shimmy things.

I'll go get some more.
mind the money.

Damon: caroline.

Caroline, help me.

Caroline.

Help me.

Help me.

That'll be $20.

I saw you last night.

You were talking
to a friend of mine,

At the grill?

Well, i--i thought
it was somebody i knew.

Stefan salvatore.

Nah, it can't be.
it's just my mind

Playing tricks on me.

Where do you think
you'd seen him before?

When i first moved here,

I stayed
at the salvatore
boarding house.

Oh.

Stefan was just

Passing through
to visit his uncle.

I mean, none of us
knew he was even here

Until the attack.

The attack?

His uncle
got killed.

Mauled by an animal
in the woods.

His uncle, zach?

Mm-mmm. joseph.

I'm sorry, sir.

I don't think
i'm familiar
with the story.

Oh, how could you?

I mean,
this happened
years ago.

Grandpa, you gotta go.
mom wants you home.

Ok?

Ah.

He wasn't bugging
you, was he?

He's a little
alzy-heimer.

No, he was sweet.

Hey, sir,

I'm sorry. um,
are you sure

That the man that you saw,

That you knew, his name
was stefan salvatore?

Yes.

I remember his ring
and his brother--

Damon?
yeah.

Stefan and damon
salvatore.

When was this?

It was early june,

1953.

Yeah.

June, 1953.

Caroline finally
freed you, huh?

Uh, i don't know
where she went.

She abandoned me.

Hey, i realized earlier,
i had no idea

That your family
was from italy.

No?

Last name salvatore
didn't do it for you?

Right.

Duh.

Are there
any other salvatores
in mystic falls?

My uncle zach.

Where did
everyone else go?

Kinda just spread out.

Hmm.

Why?

I'm just trying
to learn more
about you.

Hmm.

Jeremy: where
are you taking me?

Vicki: we can't
hide out in your
room all the time.

[both chuckle]

Welcome to my other
favorite party place.

What, e cecemery?

Yeah.
it's cool, huh?

Boy:
yo, vick!

What's up, jared?

You baby-sitting,
donovan?

This is jeremy.
he's cool.

Smoke up.
[chuckles]

Your car was done
an hour ago.

You're saying that
out loud why?

Hi. elena, right?
i think i met you once

When you were 9.
oh.

Your emotional
maturity level when
we were together.

Ouch. here i thought
we were making progress.

Is he enough
in your good graces

That i can ask him
for a favor?

If i do her a favor,
will i get back in
your good graces?

Uh, a very reluctant
maybe to both.

Done. wait.
one condition.

Dinner, tonight,
your house.

Fine. but you're
eating leftovers.

Ooh.

[chuckles]
what do you need?

Do you have access
to old news stories,

Say, fifties?

Yeah, at the station.

Between the ariveses
and the internet,

We pretty much
have everything.

I have this report
way past due.

It'd be a life saver.

Heading there now.

Let's go.

If anyone asks,
you don't know where i went.

I don't want caroline
to know that i left.

Damon: caroline,
help me.

Caroline.

Help me.

Damon?

Damon?

Damon?

Oh, my god!

What is this?

How did i know
that you were here?

Because i wanted you to.

Very, very badly.

Let me out of here.

Please.

You bit me.

You liked it.

Remember?

Why do i keep remembering
the same things,

But in different ways?

You remember what
i want you to remember.

And now that
the vervain has passed
out of your system,

You won't remember
what you're about to do.

What am i
about to do?

You're gonna
open the door.

You're gonna
open the door.

Zach: no! no!

Get out of here.

Run!

Run!

[caroline grunting]

[screaming]

Sweeper duty.

What?

We have to clean
the pavement.

It's a car wash.

By definition,
the pavement's clean.

But not dry.

And i'm doing this why?

Caroline bailed,
so that leaves me in charge.

Fabulous.

[sighs]

[music playing]

[all yelling]

Bonnie!

Bonnie!

Bonnie!

Hey.

What just happened?

You were in some
kind of a trance.

Did i do this?

I think so, yes.

Nobody else saw,
did they?

Don't tell anybody.

Please.

[sirens]

Logan: we digitized
all our archives last year.

You can pull all the remote
footage right up on screen.

What is it exactly
you're looking for?

An incident
from 1953,

If it even happened--
[cell phone rings]

At the old salvatore
boarding house.

Sorry, one second.

Yeah?

All right, be right there.

I gotta go.

You believe there's
actual news to cover
in this town?

All right, use keywords
to search the database.

It's pretty easy
to navigate.

And brady down in tech
will help you out
with anything you need.

Ok.
all right?

Oh, hey.

Could you put in
a good word for me
with jenna?

You got it.

All right.
good luck.

[door closes]

[exhales]

What?

I'm stoned in a cemetery.

They don't mind,
they're dead.

Let me take this
up a notch.

Hey, tony.

Oh!

Nice.

Vickies from vicki.

Ha!

Well, thank you,
elena gilbert,

Whoever you are.

You took those
from the house?

She wa't u ung it.

She's gonna notice
if they're gone.
that's not cool.

It's no big deal, jer.

Yeah, it kinda is, vick.

Damn, dude.

Vicki brought
the party police.

Shut up, tony.

I'm sorry. i didn't
mean to make you mad.

Well, what are we doing,
partying in a cemetery

With a bunch of losers?
those are my friends.

They're waste of space
small-town lifers.

Yeah? what am i?

You're different, vick.

No, you are.

You're the kid
with the big house

Who's acting out
because his parents
died. guess what--

You'll get over it.

You will pull
yourself together,

Move on, and one day
tell your kids stories

About your dark period
growing up.

And i'll still be here,
waiting tables at the grill,

Partying
at the cemetery

With a bunch of waste of
space small-town lifers.

Look--
go home, jeremy.

If i want to feel like
crap about myself,

I'll just
go back to tyler.

[indistinct police radio]

Hey, have you seen
elena?

No, not for a while.

You think
she went home?

Not sure.
thanks.

Hey.

I'm not
saying this for you.

I'm saying it for her.

But she's big on trust.

So whatever you're
holding back from her,

The more you try to hide it,

The more she won't stop
till she figures it out.

This is michael fell

Reporting to you
from the salvatore
boarding house,

Where a brutal animal attack
has ended in tragedy.

Ok, they're bringing
out the bodies.

See if you can get closer.

Is that the nephew?

I didn't see you
at the car wash.

Left early.

Honey, are you ok?

Anything you want
to talk about?

Is it a boy thing?

Mom, if i want
to talk boys,
i'll call dad.

At least he's successfully
dating one.

[music playing]

Zach!

Oh, no, Zach...

Elena: dear diary,

I'm not a believer.

People are born,
they grow old,

And then they die.

That's the world we live in.

[music playing]

Elena: there's no magic,
no mysticism,

No immortality.

There's nothing
that defies
rational thought.

I don't know
what's happening to me.

I know, dear.

[music playing]

Logan?

Logan?

Elena: people are supposed
to be who they say they are.

And not lie or hide
their true selves.

What are you
doing here?

Oh, hey, man.
just looking
for the bathroom.

[music playing]

Elena: it's not possible.

I'm not a believer,
i can't be.

But how can i deny
what's right in front of me?

Someone who never
grows old...

Man: june, 1953.

Never gets hurt...

Oh, my god, your hand!

Is it deep?
how bad is it?

Someone who changes in ways
that can't be explained...

Hey, um, are you ok?

Your eye.

[music playing]

Your face.

Girls bitten...
what is that?

Oh, my god,
what happened to you?

It's nothing!
bodies drained of blood...

[gasps]

Did she say what
kind of animal it was?

She said it was a vampire.

[music playing]

Donovan?

No, i'm good.

[music playing]

[sighs]

Not it.
not it.

Not it.

Ah, vicki.

[laughter]

[music playing]

[damon coughing,
groaning]

Hey, man, you ok?

Come here.

Come here.

You don't look good.

Come closer.

I have something--
[coughs]

That i have to tell you.

[coughing]

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

I got you, i got you.

It's ok. it's ok.

[screaming]

[elena breathing heavily]

What are you?

Stefan: for over
a century, i have
lived in secret,

Until now.
i know the risk,
but i have to know her.

Damon: elena,
she's a dead ringer
for katherine.

Is that
"damon salvatore"?

And that's
"stefan salvatore."

The original
salvatore brothers.

1864, you and katherine
were the perfect couple.

They've come back.

Did you get
the gilbert watch?

I can get it.

Hey, man. you ok?
come here.

Whoa. whoa.
i got you.

Aah!

I know you.

I think you have
the wrong person.

You haven't aged a day.

There are things
that you don't know,

Things that i want
to tell you, but i can't.

Are you sure
that the man you knew,

His name was
stefan salvatore?

Yes.
when was this?

1953.

Dear diary,
i'm not a believer.

People are born.
they grow old.

Then they die.

That's the world we live in.

But how can i deny
what's right in front of me?

Someone who never grows old,

Girls bitten.
somebody help!

Bodies drained of blood.

[horse walking]

[horse neighing]

Whoa.

You must be miss pierce.

Please,
call me katherine.

What are you?

What are you?

You know.

No, i don't.

Yes, you do,

Or you wouldn't be here.

It's not possible.

It can't be.

[sets down stake]

Everything you know...

And every belief that you have
is about to change.

Are you ready for that?

What are you?

I'm a vampire.

I shouldn't have come.

No.

No.

How did you do that?

Please don't
be afraid of me.

Let me go.
no.

Elena, there's things that you
have to know and understand.

Let me go!

Elena, please.

[muffled music playing
over headphones]

Elena.
[gasps]

I would never hurt you.

You're safe with me.

All those
animal attacks,

Those people
who died--

No. that was damon.

Damon?
yes.

I don't drink human blood.

That's not how i choose
to survive, but damon does.

I'll explain everything to you,
but i beg you, elena,

Do not tell anybody.

How can you ask me that?

Because you knowing this
is dangerous

For so many reasons.

You can hate me,

But i need you to trust me.

just go.

Just go, please.

Go.

If you mean me no harm,
then just go.

I never wanted this.

Mmm.

[grunts]

[speed dial]

Hello.

I want my ring.

Where are you?

I'm at the sizzler.

I had the buffet.

Where's my ring?

I don't have it.
where are you?
what have you done?

no, what have you done?

You're the one that
locked me in the basement
and starved me,

So whatever i've done,

Whoever i've sucked dry
is on you, buddy.

You're being careless.
how many more

Animal attacks
is this town
gonna believe, huh?

I know how to cover
my tracks, stefan.

Where's my ring?

I gave it
to zach to hide.

Probably shouldn't
have killed him.

Ah, you almost
got me.

Where is it?

I'll get it back,
but i need time.

What, did you fedex it
to rome? where is it?

I want my ring, stefan,

Or my next stop's
elena's.

I already want you dead.
don't give me another reason
to make it happen.

Don't give me another
reason to rip you apart.

Yeah? is that
gonna be before or after
you get your ring back?

Just get it.

[coughs]

You just don't
wanna die, do you?

You said you would
explain everything.

That's why i asked you
to meet me here.

When you google "vampire,"
you get a world of fiction.

What's the reality?

I can tell you
whatever you wanna know.

I know you eat garlic.
yes.

And somehow,
sunlight's not an issue.

Here's your drinks.

Thank you.

We have rings
that protect us.

Crucifixes?
decorative.

Holy water?
drinkable.

Mirrors?
myth.

You said you don't kill
to survive.

Animal blood
keeps me alive,

But not as strong
as damon. it can be
very powerful.

And yet you let him
get involved with caroline?

Forcing damon
not to do something

Is much more dangerous,
believe me.

He was hurting her.

He was feeding on her.
he was able

To take away
her memories
of being bitten

using a form
of mind compulsion.

She never knew what
was happening to her.

If he wanted
to kill her,
he would have.

Is that supposed
to make it ok?

no. no, none of this
is ok, elena.

I know that.

Are there any others,
aside from you and damon?

Not in mystic falls,
not anymore.

Not anymore?

There was a time
when this town was...

Very much aware
of vampires,

And it didn't end well
for anybody.

That's why it's
important that you
don'tell anyone.

I can't promise that.

Elena...

Give me today.

I will answer any
questions that you have,

And when it's over,

You can decide
for yourself

What you wanna do
with what you know.

It'll be your choice.

Never smelled one
this bad before.

It tried to cover
its tracks.

Are you sure?

I'm positive.
you only burn a corpse

To try to hide
cause of death,

And there are
no shell casings.

We know who they are?

Doc'll have to check
their dental records.

What story should i run?

Drug deal gone bad.

It's not too big a stretch.

I got the gilbert watch.

Good.

Found this in the brush
about 10 yards away.

Vicki donovan.

You know her?

I went to high school
with her mother.

Think she's
one of these?

I hope not.

Where are you, stefan?

I'm trapped at the house,

And i'm getting really bored
and really impatient,

and i don't do bored
and impatient.

Bring me my ring.

[music playing]

Damn it.

Aw, don't get blood
on the couch.

Please.

I got you good,
didn't i?

Well, you're not
gonna be any fun today.

I'm so gonna
regret this.

[gasping]

Drink up.

Drink it up.

Don't drip.

There you go. good girl.

That's it.

Stefan: stop here.

What are we doing here?

I want to show you something.

In the middle
of nowhere?

This...

Didn't used to be nowhere.

Used to be my home.

It looks so...

Old?

It's because
they are.

Wait. how long have you...

I've been 17 years old
since 1864.

Oh, my god.

You said
you wanted to know.

I'm not gonna
hold anything back.

Half century before
the boardinghouse
was even built,

This was
my family's home.

Damon and i...

We were both born here.

The salvatore brothers,
best of friends.

Raah!

Wait. where did you
learn this game?

Camp outside atlanta.

One of t officers
picked it up at harvard. catch.

Wait a minute.
wait a minute.

What are the rules?
what are the rules?

Who needs rules?

Mind if i join you?

Uh, well,
you could, uh--
you could get hurt.

My brother likes
to play rough.

Somehow, i think
that you play rougher.

[laughing]

Why are you
just standing there?

That is a girl
who clearly wants
to be chased.

If you don't do it,
i will.

You knew katherine
1864?

Damon made it
seem like--

Damon was trying
to make you think that...

I was still heartbroken.

He saw that i was happy
with you,

And he wanted to ruin it.

All because you
loved the same girl
145 years ago?

She wasn't
just any girl.

[katherine laughing]

Ha!

I win. what's my prize?

Damon: what would
you like it to be?

They extended
your leave?

I was simply
having too much fun

To return to battle.

Your commitment
to the confederacy
is inspiring.

Well, this works out
wonderfully for me.

How's that,
miss katherine?

Now i'll have both of you here
to keep me entertained.

First and foremost,

I'll need someone to escort me
to the founder's ball.

With pleasure.
i would be honored.

The smart and kind
salvatore brothers
both coming to my rescue.

How will i ever choose?

Stefan:
she chose me.

I escorted her
to the ball

At the original
lockwood mansion.

The first founder's party...

Where you signed
the registry.

I didn't care that
i had gotten something
that my brother wanted.

I didn't even care
if it hurt him.

I only knew
that i wanted her.

So he was upset.

That's the thing
about damon.

He doesn't get mad.

He just gets even.

Vicki: oh, man.

That shower was so great.

[music playing]

What did you give me?

Some blood.
you loved it.

I did?

Wait. i'm confused.

How did we get here?

Weetetn the woods.

You were drunk.
i attacked you.

Then i killed
all of your friends
and brought you here,

Gave you same blood.
you loved it.

And now we're
gonna party till
the sun goes down.

Ok.

Um, but first,
can i have another hit?

That blood was so good.

Only if i can.

Stefan:
what damon wants,
damon usually gets.

I didn't know it
at t time, but...

Turns out that night...

Katherine was
with him, too.

So he stole her from you,
not the other way around?

Turns out she
wasn't ours to steal.

I will love you forever.

Forever is a very long time,
you know.

Not long enough.

Good morning.

Clear the room, please.

You're upset.

Your face,

It was like a demon.

But you're
not afraid.

Get away from me.
get away.

It doesn't
change the way
you feel about me.

You will
not tell anyone.

I--
shh.

We will go on
exactly as we have.

Yes.

We will go on.

Heh heh.

You have no idea
of the future i have
planned for us, stefan--

You, me, and damon.

No rules.

Stefan: she could control
my mind and damon's.

She compelled each of us
to keep the secret
from the other.

She wanted all of us
to be together forever.

Didn't work out
that way, but...

Damon and i, looks like
we're stuck with each other...

Like it or not.

Is that damon's ring?

I took it from him,
but i have to give it back.

No. don't, stefan.
keep it hidden.

elena, if i don't
give it to him,

He'll retaliate in the only way
that he knows he can hurt me.

And how is that?

By hurting you.

[creak]

Doc i.d. the bodies?

A few townies.
notorious druggies.

I suppose that'll
make it easy for people
to buy the story.

And vicki donovan?

She's not one
of the deceased.

Where the hell is she?

I wish i knew.

Sorry i'm late.

You have the watch?

[clicks]

It's ready.

That's it?

Yes. that's it.

[music playing]

I am so over tyler,
so over him.

I knew from the beginning

That i was only
a piece of ass to him,

But i thought maybe
if he got to know me better,
he might see something more.

But no.

Now, jeremy,
on the other hand,

That's all he's ever seen in me
is something more,

And i like that.

Jeremy, huh?

Elena's brother?

Yeah. yeah.

So, elena used to date
my brother,

And they were
always together,

So jeremy would always
be hanging around

And crushing on me and--

Hey, why don't you
have a girlfriend?

You're, like,
totally cool
and so hot.

I know.

Don't you wanna be in love?

I've been in love.

It's painful and pointless
and overrated.

Except when it isn't.

No more talking.

Let's dance.

[sizzles]

[new song playing]

My mom spends
most of her time

In virginia beach
with pete.

He drives trucks.

I don't remember my dad,
bufrom what i gather,

He's not worth
remembering.

Your life is
so pathetic.

Yeah. i mean,
i'm the screwed-up one.

Matt's got it so easy.
he's the golden boy.

I mean, he's gonna get
a football scholarship

And marry elena
and have a lawn mower
and some babies,

and when
i think of my future,
i just come up blank.

You are so damaged.

Yep.

I mean, you don't have
one hint of self-esteem.

Nope, none.

I think i know
what can help you.

So what's that?

Death.

[snaps]

What happened?

We were dancing,
and then--

then i killed you.

[groans] what?

You're dead.
i'm dead?

Yeah, well,
let's not make
a big deal out of it.

Drank my blood,
i killed you,

And now you have
to feed in order
to complete the process.

[groans] you're wasted.

You don't wanna be
out there all alone.

You're about to get
really freaky.

ok, i had a really good time.

I just wanna go home.

You're gonna start
craving blood,

And until you get it,
you're gonna feel

very out of it.
you have to be careful.

Come on, move.

See? you're already
starting to fall apart.

And i'm going home now.

Ok, fine.
i'm just warning you.

Actually, you know what?

You should go.

In fact, if i were you,

I would stop by
your boyfriend jeremy's house.

Yeah, whatever.

Bye.
tell elena i said hi.

and if you see stefan,
tell him to call me.

[siren bloops]

[police dispatch chatter]

I got stanley
on the moore
street entrance.

The rest of us'll cover
other access points.

Call him or call me
if that thing goes off.

Don't use the radio.
cellphones only.

Got it.

You've got 8 rounds.

Remember,
wood bullets
won't kill him,

But it'll
wound him enough

For you to get close
and stake him.

You sure
you can handle this?

Of course i can.

You ever staked
a vampire before?

Have you?

[doorbell ringing]

Coming!

Hey.

The sun is killing me.
my eyes are on fire.

Where have you been?

It's good.
everything's good.

Did something happen?

I'm hungry.

What do you
got to eat?

You're high?

Vicki, it's the middle
of the day.

Could you just
not talk so loud?

My head, it hurts.

I need quiet.

E mind control...

You said katherine used.

Do you ever
do that to me?

No.

That necklace,

It contains an herb
called vervain.

it protects you
from being compelled.

I wanted to protect you
from damon's influence.

But i also wanted to...

Protect you from me.

All ght, n n you should
never take that necklace off...

Because no matter
what happens after today,

No matter
how you feel about me...

You'll know that you were
free to make your own choice.

Where is she?

Come this way.

What's she on?

---i d't know.

Hey, vic.
how you doin'?

Not good, mattie.

I hurt.

Ok, where's it hurt?

My gums. my jaw hurts.

My gum--there's
something in my gums,
and it hurts.

Ok, well--
no. just leave me alone.

Come on, vic.
don't be like that.
let's get you home.

Just turn it off!

Turn what off?

The talking,
the chatter,

Just turn it off.

[tv sound inaudible]

[volume increasing]
...horribly.

3 bodies were found dead
in what is believed to be

A drug deal gone awry.

The bodies have yet
to be identified.

They were discovered
earlier today

Over at the old
mystic falls cemetery.

That's where
we were last night.

What happened, vic?

...homicide, and are fast
under way looking for suspects.

They're asking anyone
with information...

I'm calling the cops.
no. don't.

What happened
after i left
last night, vick?

I'm fine. i'm fine.

Damn, vick.

Elena:
what's going on?

Matt: she's really
messed up.

Elena, back up.

Vicki, look at me.

Focus.

You're gonna be fine.

Everything's
gonna be fine.

Guys, take her
up to bed.

Shut the blinds.
she's gonna be ok.
come on.

Come on.

You know
what's wrong with her?

Yep.
what is it?

She's transitioning.

Transitioning to what?

A vampire.

What?

Damon must have gotten to her.
she's new.

She hasn't completed
her transformation yet.

H-how does she do that?

She has to feed
on human blood.

And what if
she doesn't?

She'll die.

She may only have
a few hours.

She's upstairs
with him right now.

It's ok.
she doesn't know what's
happening to her yet.

So when is
she gonna know?

Right now, she doesn't
remember anything.

A part of her
is still human,

But slowly,
the deeper she gets
into the transition,

the memories will start
to come back,

And then
she'll know she has
to make the choice.

The same choice you made?

I'm sorry
i'm so much trouble.

Aw, you just--you need
to sleep it off, ok?

No.

Vick.

Vick!

She was fine,
and then she just--
she just freaked out.

I'm gonna
go look for her.

Call me if you
hear anything.

I can track her.

Go.

[owl hoots]

[clicking]

[cellphone rings]

[ring]

Yeah.

I think i got something.

It's pointing towards
the old cemetery.

Headed your way.

Maybe we should
check in with matt.

He'll call
when he finds her.

Well, what are we
supposed to do?

We wait.
we're supposed to wait.

I don't know
what's wrong with her.

She'll be fine.

It'll all be fine.

[doorbell rings]

Jeremy, go upstairs.

You're afraid of me.

I'm gonna go out
on a limb here
and guess.

Stefan finally
fessed up.

Stay away from me.

Hey, there's no need
to be rude.

I'm just looking
for stefan.

May i come in?

Oh, wait.
of course i can.

I've been invited.

We can cut to the chase
if you want.

I'm not gonna kill you
right now.

That wouldn't serve
my greater agenda.

So...

Where's stefan?

He's out looking
for vicki.

Don't look at me
with those judgey
little eyes.

Girl's gonna thank me
for what i did to her.

Did you thank katherine?

Mmm.

Got the whole
life story, huh?

I got enough.

Oh, i doubt that.

Tell my brother
i'm looking for him.

Oh, tip for later.

Be careful who you
invite in the house.

Vicki.

I'm starting
to remember things--

What he is,
what he said.

I remember you.
the hospital,

The--the rooftop,
it's all coming back.

I'm so sorry.

Damon had no right
to do this to you.

He said that
i need to feed.

What will happen
if i don't?

You'll fade quickly...

And then it'll
all just be over.

I'll be dead.

Hey.

I don't want this.

I know. it'll be ok.

You're gonnae ok.

I can help you.

Is it better?

Is it better?

Will i be better?

I wanna go home.

Will you take me home?

Ok.

[gunshot]

[stefan groans]

Ahh!

No!

[groaning]

It's wood.

They know.

If anyone's gonna kill
you, it's gonna be me.

My ring.

No!

No! vicki!

I'm sorry.

Oops.

The watch.

Find the watch.

[music playing]

You're bleeding.

No, it's ok.
it's ok. i'm ok.

I couldn't stop her.

I tried.

What does that mean?

She fed,

And then i lost her.

Oh, my god.

I'll take care of it.

I'll find her,
and i will show her

That she can live
like i do.

I will make sure
that she does

Not hurt anybody, elena.
i promise you.

What do i tell
my brother and--
and matt?

We'll come up
with a story.

You mean we'll
come up with a lie.

I'm so sorry.

I gave you today
just like you asked.

And i understand that
you would never do
anything to hurt me,

And i promise i will
keep your secret, but...

I can't be with you,
stefan.

I'm sorry. i--

I just can't.

Man: for over a century,
I have lived in secret;

Hiding in the shadows,

Alone in the world.

Until now.

I am a vampire.

And this is my story.

* when there's fire *

* on a crown *

* should have turned-- *

An hour's drive
to hear that crap.

You know, it wasn't
even a band.

A guy with a guitar.

An hour each way.

He wasn't that bad.

He sounded like
james blunt.

What's wrong with that?

We already have
a james blunt.
One's all we need.

So why did you come?

Because I love you.

Nicely done.

* stretches out *

* in the way beyond *

What's with all the fog?

It'll clear
in a second.

Watch out!

Are you ok?!

We just hit someone!
Oh, my god!

Call for help.

Come on, come on!

Please be alive!

Oh, my god.

There's no signal!

Darren!

Darren?

I shouldn't
have come home.

I know the risk.

But I had no choice.

I have to know her.

Dear diary,

Today will be different.

It has to be.

I will smile,
and it will be
believable.

My smile was saying
"I'm fine, thank you."

"Yes, I feel much better."

I will no longer be
the sad little girl
who lost her parents.

I will start fresh,
be someone new.

It's the only way
I'll make it through.

<i>[Here wego by
mat kearney playing]</i>

Toast.
I can make toast.

It's all about the coffee,
aunt Jenna.

Is there coffee?

Your first day of school

And I'm totally
unprepared.

Lunch money?

I'm good.

Anything else?

A number two pencil?
What am I missing?

Don't you have
a big presentation today?

I'm meeting
with my thesis
advisor at...now.

Crap!

Then go. We'll be fine.

You ok?

Don't start.

* oh, oh, here we go again *

* I know
how I lost a friend *

* we go 'round
and 'round again *

* oh, oh *

* oh, oh *

So grams is telling me
I'm psychic.

Our ancestors
were from salem,

Which isn't all
that, I know, crazy,

But she's going on
and on about it,

And I'm like, put this woman
in a home already!

But then I started
thinking,

I predicted Obama and I predicted
Heath Ledger,

And I still think Florida
will break off

And turn into little
resort islands.

Elena!

Back in the car.

I did it again,
didn't I?

I--I'm sorry, Bonnie.

You were telling me that...

That I'm
psychic now.

Right. Ok,
then predict something.

About me.

I see...

What was that?!

Oh, my god!

Elena, are you ok?

It's ok. I'm fine.

It was like a bird
or something.

It came out
of nowhere.

Really, I can't be
freaked out

By cars for the rest
of my life.

I predict this year
is going to be kick ass.

And I predict all
the sad and dark
times are over

And you are going
to be beyond happy.

Major lack of
male real estate.

Look at
the shower curtain
on kelly beach.

She looks a hot--
Can I still say "tranny mess"?

No, that's over.

Ahh, find a man,
coin a phrase.

It's a busy year.

He hates me.

That's not hate.

That's "you dumped me, 
but I'm too cool to show it,

"But secretly
I'm listening

To air supply's
greatest hits."

Elena. Oh, my god.

How are you?

Oh, it's so good
to see you.

How is she?
Is she good?

Caroline, I'm right here.

And I'm fine.
Thank you.

Really?

Yes. Much better.

Oh, you poor thing.

Ok, Caroline.

Oh!

Ok, see you guys
later?

Ok! Bye.

No comment.

I'm not going
to say anything.

Don't take more than two
in a six-Hour window.

Hey, Vicki.

I knew I'd find you here
with the crackheads.

Hey.

Hey, Pete Wentz called.

He wants
his nail polish back.

<i>Pete Wentz, huh?
How old school T.R.L. of you.</i>

Carson Daly fan?

Oh, Ty, be nice.
Be nice.

That's Elena's
little brother.

I know who he is.

I'll still
kick his ass.

* sense of humor's
void and numb *

* and I'm bored to tears *

* I'm bored to tears *

Hold up.
Who's this?

Elena: all I see is back.

It's a hot back.

Secretary: your records
are incomplete.

You're missing
immunization records,

And we do insist
on transcripts.

Please look again.

I'm sure everything
you need is there.

Well, you're right.

So it is.

I'm sensing seattle,
and he plays the guitar.

You're really going to run this 
whole psychic thing

into the ground, huh?
- Pretty much.

Jeremy,
good batch, man.

I'll be right back.

Please be hot.

Whoa!
Pants down, chick!

Great.

It's the first
day of school
and you're stoned.

No, I'm not.
Where is it?

Is it on you?
Stop, all right?!

You need to chill yourself,
all right?

Chill myself?
What is that,

Stoner talk?

Dude,
you are so cool.

Look, stop! I don't
have anything on me.
Are you crazy?

You haven't seen
crazy, jeremy!

I gave you
a summer pass,

But I am done
watching you
destroy yourself.

No, no, no,
you know what?

Go ahead.
Keep it up.
But just know

That I am going
to be there

To ruin your buzz
every time,
you got it?

Jeremy, I know
who you are.

And it's not
this person.

So don't be
this person.

I don't need this.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Uh, pardon me.

Um...

Is this the men's room?

Yes. Um,
I was just,

Um--I was just--

It's a long story.

Just...

Thank you.

Once our home state
of virginia
joined confederacy

In 1861, it created
a tremendous
amount of tension

Within the state.

People in virginia's
northwest region

Had different ideals
than those from
the traditional deep south.

Then Virginia
divided in 1863

with the northwest region
joining the union.

* do you know
where your heart is? *

* do you think
you can find it? *

* or did you trade it
for something *

* somewhere *

* better just to have it *
[bird squawks]

* do you know where
your love is? *

* do you think
that you lost it? *

Dear diary,

I made it through the day.

I must have said,
"I'm fine, thanks,"

At least 37 times.

And I didn't mean it once.

But no one noticed.

* 'cause
you won't let go *

* of anything
you hold *

Elena: when someone
asks, "how are you?"

They really don't
want an answer.

* all I need
is the air I breathe *

* and a place to rest *

Ok.

Hi, bird.

That's not creepy
or anything.

Shoo!

That's what I thought.

Ahh!

You ok?

Were you
following me?

No, I, uh, I just--
I saw you fall.

Uh-Huh, and you just
happened to be

Hanging out
in a cemetery.

I'm visiting.
I have family here.

Oh.

Wow. Tactless.

I'm sorry.
It's the fog,

It's making me
foggy.

And then back there,
there was this bird,

And it was all
very hitchcock
for a second.

That is the bird movie,
right, the hitchcock?

I'm Elena.

I'm Stefan.

I know.

We have history
together.

And english and french.

Right.

Oh.

Thanks.

Nice ring.

Oh. Um,

It's a family ring, yeah.

I'm kinda stuck with it.
It's weird, huh?

No, no. It's just,
I mean, there are rings

And then there's that.

Did you hurt yourself?

Hmm?
Did you hurt yourself?

Oh, uh,

I don't know.

Oh! Look at that.

That is not pretty.

You ok?

You should go.

Take care of that.

Really, it's nothing.

I lost control today.

Everything
I've kept buried inside

Came rushing
to the surface.

I'm simply not able
to resist her.

Thanks.
Hey.

Working.

Thanks, vick.

Do you need
another refill?

I'd love one.

Please tell me
you're not hooking
up with my sister.

I'm not hooking up
with your sister.

You're such a dick.

Hey, what's
your deal?

I mean, summer
you act one way

And then school
starts and you can't
be bothered.

Look, jeremy,
I really appreciate
all the pharmaceuticals,

But you can't keep
following me around
like a lost puppy.

When's the last time

You had sex
with a puppy?

Hey, keep it down.
I don't want to tell
the whole world

I deflowered
Elena's kid brother.

Yeah, and deflowered
and deflowered.

We hooked up a few times
in a drug haze. It's over.

You gotta back off
between you ruin things
between me and Tyler.

Oh, come on,
the guy's
a total douche.

He only wants you
for your ass.

Yeah?

What do you want me for?

His name
is Stefan Salvatore.

He lives with uncle up at 
the old Salvatore boarding house.

He hasn't lived here
since he was a kid.

Military family,
so they moved around a lot.

He's a gemini, and his
favorite color is blue.

You got all of that
in one day?

Oh, please, I got all that
between third and fourth period.

We're planning
a june wedding.

I'm meeting Bonnie
at the grill.

Ok, have fun.
Wait, I got this.

Don't stay out late,
it's a school night.

Well done,
aunt Jenna.

Oh.

Sorry, I was about to knock.

I wanted to apologize
for my disappearing act earlier.

I know it was...

Strange.

No worries.

I get it, blood
makes you squeamish.

Um, something like that.

How's your leg?

Oh, it's fine.

Just a scratch,
barely.

How did you know
where I lived?

It's a small town.

I asked
the first person I saw.

Um, I thought
you might want this back.

Oh, I must have
dropped it.

I--
Thank you.

Don't worry,
I didn't...read it.

No? 

Why not? Most people
would have.

Well, I wouldn't want
anyone to read mine.

You keep a journal?

Yeah, if I don't
write it down,

I forget it.

Memories are too important.

Yeah.

I'm just gonna,

Um, you don't have
to stay out there.

I'm fine.

Sorry, were you going
somewhere?

Yeah, I'm meeting
a friend.

Do you want to come?

How's Elena doing?

Her mom
and dad died.
How do you think?

She's putting on
a good face,

But it's only been
four months.

Has she said anything
about me?
Oh, no.

So not getting
in the middle.

You pick up
the phone
and call her.

I feel weird calling her.

She broke up with me.

Give it
more time, matt.

* when I'm with him *

* I'm thinking of you *

* oh-Ho *

More time, huh?

* what you would do *

* if you were the one *

* who was spending *

Hey, I'm matt,
nice to meet you.

Hi. Stefan.

Hey.

Hey.

So, you were born
in mystic falls?

Mm-Hmm. And moved
when I was
still young.

Parents?

My parents
passed away.

I'm sorry.

Any siblings?

None that I talk to.

I live with my uncle.

So, Stefan,

if you're new, then you don't know
about the party tomorrow.

It's a back to school thing
at the falls.

Are you going?

Of course she is.

<i>[Running up that hill
by placebo playing]</i>

You promised.

This was
an animal attack.

Don't give me that.
I know the game.

You tear them up enough,
they always suspect
an animal attack.

You said you had it
under control.

And I do.

Please, uncle Stefan.

Mystic falls
is a different place now.

It's been quiet for years,
but there are people
who still remember.

And you being here,

It's just going
to stir things up.

It's not my intention.
Then what is?

Why did you come back?
After all this time, why now?

I don't have
to explain myself.

I know that you can't
change what you are.

But you don't
belong here anymore.

Where do I belong?

I can't tell you
what to do.

But coming back here
was a mistake.

* you want to know *

* know that
it doesn't hurt me *

* oh, oh, oh *

* you want to hear about
the deal I'm making *

* and if I only could *

* make a deal with god *

* and get him
to swap our places *

* be runnin' up that road *

* be runnin' up that hill *

* be runnin' up
that building *

* hill, hill *

* if I only could *

* be running up that hill *

* hill *

The battle of
willow creek

Took place right at
the end of the war

In our very own
mystic falls.

How many casualties
resulted in this battle?

Ms. Bennett?

Um...a lot?

I'm not sure.

Like a whole lot.

Cute becomes dumb
in an instant,
ms. Bennett.

Mr. Donovan.

Would you like to take
this opportunity

To overcome
your embedded
jock stereotype?

It's ok, mr. Tanner,
I'm cool with it.

Hmm. Elena?

Surely you can
enlighten us about

One of the town's most 
significantly historical events?

I'm sorry, I--
I don't know.

I was willing to be
lenient last year

For obvious reasons, Elena,

But the personal excuses
ended with summer break.

Stefan: there were
346 casualties,

Unless you're counting
local civilians.

That's correct.

Mister...

Salvatore.

Salvatore.
Any relation to

The original settlers
here at mystic falls?

Distant.

Well, very good.

Except, of course,
there were no
civilian casualties

In this battle.

Actually,
there were 27, sir.

Confederate soldiers,
they fired on the church,

Believing it to be
housing weapons.

They were wrong.

It was a night
of great loss.

The founder's
archives are, uh,

Stored in civil hall
if you'd like to
brush up on your facts.

Mr. Tanner.
[All chuckling]

Mr. Tanner: hmm.

* note the feeling
when we lift off *

* watching the world,
so small and low *

What do you mean,
you never hooked up?

Girl: people look up to me.

I have to set an example.

Bonnie:
just admit it, Elena.

Oh, ok, so he's
a little pretty.

He has that
romance novel stare.

Stefan looked deep
into her eyes,

Piercing her very soul.

Hey! You made it!

I did.

Well, let's
get you a drink.

Well, I'm--
Oh, come on.

So where is he?

I don't know.

You tell me,
you're the psychic one.

Right, I forgot.
Ok, so give me a sec.

Grams says I have
to concentrate.

Wait, you need
a crystal ball.

Ahh.

Ta da.

What?

That was weird.

When I touched you,
I saw a crow.

What?

A crow.

There was fog,

A man.

I'm drunk.

It's the drinking.
There's nothing
psychic about it.

Yeah? Ok, I'm gonna
get a refill.

Ok.

Bonnie!

Hi.

Hi.

I did it again,
didn't it?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

You're upset about something.
Oh, uh,

No, it's Bonnie.
She's...

You know what?

Never mind.
You're...here.

I'm here.

* but who decides
which route we take *

* as people drift
into a dream world *

You know, you're kind
of the talk of the town.

Am I?
Mm-Hmm.

Mysterious new guy,
oh, yeah.

Well, you have
the mysterious thing
going, too.

Twinged in sadness.

What makes you think
that I'm sad?

Well, we did
meet in a graveyard.

Right.

Well, no, technically
we met in the men's room.

You don't want
to know, it's...

It's not exactly
party chit-Chat.

Well, I've never really been
very good at, uh,

Chit-chat.

Last spring...

My parents' car
drove off of a bridge

Into the lake.

And I was in the backseat

And I survived, but...

They didn't.

So that's my story.

You won't be sad
forever, Elena.

No, Ty.

I'm not having sex
against a tree.

Oh, come on,
it would be hot.
For who?

No, it's not
going to happen.

It's not going to
happen, not here,
not like this.

No. I said no.

I said no!
Ow, that hurts!

Hey,
leave her alone.

You know, you're starting
to get on my nerves, gilbert.

Just go, Tyler, get the hell
away from me.

Wow. Vicki donovan says no.

That's a first.

I didn't need your help.

It seems like
you did.

He was just drunk.
I'm drunk.

Am I throwing
myself at you?

No, you're worse.

You want to talk to me,
get to know me,

See into my soul and screw
and screw and screw

Until you're done with me.

Is that what
you think?

That's what I know.

I like Bonnie,
she seems like a good friend.

Best friend
in the world.
And matt,

He can't seem to, uh,
take his eyes off of us.

Matt's that friend
since childhood

That you start
dating

Because you owe it
to yourselves

To see if you can
be more.

And?

And then
my parents died,

And everything
changes.

Anyway, matt and I,

Together we just,
I don't know,

It wasn't, um...

It wasn't...

Passionate.

No.

No, it wasn't
passionate.

Hey, um,
are you ok?

Um,

Your eye,
it just, it's--

Oh, um...

Yeah, no.
It's, um, it's nothing.

Um, are you thirsty?

I'm gonna get us a drink.

Jeremy?

Is that you?

Jeremy?

Looking for someone?

Hey.

When you
broke up with me,

You said it was
because you needed
some time alone.

You don't look
so alone to me.

Matt, you don't
understand. It's--

That's ok, Elena.

You do what
you have to do.

I just want to let
you know that...

I still believe in us.

And I'm not
giving up on that.

* and when I think
about a day without *

Matt.

* every day's the same *

* wish that you could
find someone *

Hey! There you are.

Have you been down
to the falls yet?

Because they are
really cool at night.

And I can show you.

If you want.

I think you've had
too much to drink.

Well, of course
I have.

So--
Caroline.

You and me,

It's not gonna happen.

Sorry.

* no, don't *

I was wondering
who abducted you,

But now I know.

Is she like that with,
uh, all the guys?

No.

You're fresh meat.

She'll back off eventually.
Hmm.

God, you gotta be kidding me!

What is it?

My brother.
The drunk one?

That would be the one.

Excuse me.
Need some help?

Trust me, you're not
going to want to
witness this.

Jeremy!

Jeremy!

Jeremy, where the hell
are you going?

I don't want
to hear it!

Yeah, well, too bad!

Vicki? No!

Oh, my god, it's Vicki!
Oh, my god!

No!

Somebody help!

Vicki? Vicki,
what the hell?!

What happened to her?

Somebody,
call an ambulance!

Everybody back up,
give her some space!

It's her neck.
Something bit her.
She's losing a lot of blood.

Put this on her neck.

Vicki, Vicki, come on,
open your eyes, look at me.

What's going on?

Someone else was
attacked tonight,
Zach, and it wasn't me.

Damon.

Hello, brother.

Crow's a bit much,
don't you think?

Wait till you see
what I can do
with the fog.

When'd you get here?

Well, I couldn't miss
your first day at school.

Your hair's different.

I like it.

It's been
15 years, Damon.

Thank god.

I couldn't take
another day of the nineties.

That horrible grunge look?

Did not suit you.

Remember, Stefan,
it's important
to stay away from fads.

Why are you here?

I miss
my little brother.

You hate small towns.

It's boring.
There's nothing
for you to do.

I've managed to keep
myself busy.

You know, you left
that girl alive tonight.

That's very clumsy of you.

Ah. That can be
a problem...for you.

Why are you here now?

I could ask you
the same question.

However,
I'm fairly certain

Your answer can be
summed up all into

One little word...

Elena.

Hey.

We're gonna go
mainline coffee,
wait for news.

I gotta take
jeremy home.

Elena, there's no way
I'm psychic.

I know that.

But whatever I saw,

Or I think I saw,

I have this feeling...

Bonnie, what?

That it's just
the beginning.

She took
my breath away.

Elena.

She's a dead ringer
for katherine.

Is it working, Stefan?

Being around her,
being in her world?

Does it make you
feel alive?

She's not katherine.

Well, let's hope not.

We both know
how that ended.

Tell me something,
when's the last time

You had something
stronger than
a squirrel?

I know what you're doing,
Damon. It's not gonna work.

Yeah? Come on.
Don't you crave
a little?

Stop it. Let's do it.
Together.

I saw a couple girls
out there.

Or just, let's just
cut to the chase,

Let's just go
straight for Elena!

Stop it!

Imagine what her
blood tastes like!

I can.

I said stop!

I was impressed.

I give it a six.

Missing style, but I was
pleasantly surprised.

Very good
with the whole face--

thing.
It was good.

You know, it's all fun and games,
Damon, huh?

But wherever you go,
people die.

That's a given.
Not here.

I won't allow it.

I take that
as an invitation.

Damon, please.

After all these
years, can't we just
give it a rest?

I promised you
an eternity of misery,

So I'm just keeping my word.

Just stay away
from Elena.

Where's your ring?

Oh, yeah, sun's coming up
in a couple of hours,

And, poof,
ashes to ashes.

Relax.

It's right here.

You should know better
than to think you're
stronger than me.

You lost that fight
when you stopped

Feeding on people.

I wouldn't try it again.

I think we woke
Zach up. Hmm.

Sorry, Zach.

You ok?

I called Jenna,
she's on her way.

Those people
in uniforms,

Last time I checked,
they're the police.

People are going
to stop giving you
breaks, jer.

They just don't care
anymore.

They don't remember
that our parents
are dead,

Because they've got
their own lives
to deal with.

The rest of the world
has moved on.

You should try, too.

I've seen you in the cemetery
writing in your diary.

Is that--Is that
supposed to be you
moving on?

Mom and dad wouldn't
have wanted this.

Are you sober yet?

No. 

Keep drinking.
I gotta get you home.

I gotta get me home.

Why didn't he
go for me?

You know, how come

The guys that I want
never want me?

I'm not touching that.

I'm inappropriate.

I always say
the wrong thing.

And...

Elena always says
the right thing.

She doesn't even try!

And he just picks her.

And she's always the one
that everyone picks,

For everything.

And I try so hard,

And...

I'm never the one.

It's not a competition,
Caroline.

Yeah, it is.

* I was a heartbreaker *

* I loved you *

* the same way I do *

* but I've got so much
wickedness and sin *

* my name is pearl *

* and I love you *

* the best way I know how *

Vicki...

Hey.

Hey, it's ok.

You're gonna be ok.

Matt--
Shh.

Hey, don't try
to talk, ok?

You're fine.

Vampire.

Dear diary,

I couldn't
have been more wrong.

I thought that I could smile,
nod my way through it;

Pretend like
it would all be ok.

* some things
we don't talk about *

* better do without *

I had a plan.

I wanted to change
who I was;

Create a life
as someone new,

Someone without the past.

Without the pain.

Someone alive.

* you can never say never *

But it's
not that easy.

The bad things
stay with you.

They follow you.

* than we were before *

* don't let me go *

You can't
escape them,

As much as you want to.

* don't let me go *

* don't let me go *

* don't let me go *

* don't let me go *

All you can do
is be ready for the good.

So when it comes,

You invite it in,
because you need it.

I need it.

* I will be your guardian *

* for all that's coming in *

I know it's late.

But, uh...

I needed to know
that you were ok.

You know, for months,

That's all anyone's
wondered about me.

If I'll be ok.

What do you tell them?

That I'll be fine.

Do you ever mean it?

Ask me tomorrow.

It's warmer in the house.
We can talk.

Would you like
to come in?

Yes.

For over a century,

I have lived in secret, until now.

I know the risk, but I had no choice.

I have to know her.

I'm Elena.
I'm Stefan.

I know. We have history together.

Last spring, my parents' car

drove off of a bridge into the lake.

You won't be sad forever, Elena.

I live with my uncle.

Any siblings?

None that I talk to.

Hello, brother.
Damon.

Elena, she's a dead ringer for Catherine.

Wherever you go,
people die.

My God, it's Vickie!

Something bit her, she's losing a lot of blood.

Somebody help!

Vampire.

Don't you crave a little?
Stop.

Let's do it. Let's just go straight for Elena.

Imagine what her blood tastes like!

Stop!
Arghh!

Stay away from Elena.

I'll take that as an invitation.

* I tremble *

* tremble, tremble *

* Tremble, tremble *

* tremble, tremble *

* You're gonna eat me alive *

Hey. Did you hear that?
Hear what?

I heard thunder.

There's no thunder.

Are you sure?

Because if it rains,
then we won't be able
to see the comet.

It's not gonna rain.

Listen, i...

Got you a little
something.

It's back
in the car.

Don't you move.
mm-mm.

Hmm?

* Can you hear my heart *

* Beating like a hammer? *

Stay dry.

It's not gonna rain.

* My heart keeps beating like a hammer *

I knew it!

* Come take my pulse *

I told you it was gonna rain!

* Keeps beating like a hammer *

* Beating like a hammer *

Open!

No!

Please!

Dear diary,

this morning is... different.

There is change. I can sense it,

feel it.

I'm awake.

For the first time in a long time,

I feel completely and undeniably wide awake.

For once, I don't regret the day before it begins.

I welcome the day...

Both: because I know...

I will see her again.

I will see him again.

For the first time in a long time,

I feel good.

* And every building falls *

* And all the stars fade *

Do I look adult?

As in respectfully parental?

Depends where you're going.

Jeremy's parent-teacher conference.

Hair up or down?

Sexy stewardess.

Boozy housewife.

Up it is.

You're feisty today.

I feel good, which is rare.
So I've decided to go with it.

Fly free, walk on sunshine, and all that stuff.

Where is Jeremy?

He left early.

Something about getting to wood shop early

to finish a birdhouse.

There is no wood shop, is there?

No.
Yeah.

* ooh, ooh *

* closer to love *

* ooh, ooh *

You can't be in here, hon. Visiting hours

don't start till 9:00.

I just... 

How is she?

She's lost a lot of blood.

Yeah, but she's gonna be ok, right?

She needs her rest.

So you come back later.

Come on.

Originally discovered nearly 5 centuries ago,

it hasn't been over Mystic Falls in over 145 years.

Now, the comet will be its brightest

right after dusk

during tomorrow's celebration.

Are we bothering you, Mr. Salvatore?

Ms. Gilbert?

I brought it.

Told you.

"Wuthering Heights" by Ellis Bell.

You know, I can't believe she didn't use her real name.

All the Bronte sisters used pseudonyms.

It was the time.

Female writers weren't very accepted then.

Where did you get it?

Uh, it was passed down.

Through the family.

Ah.

I have lots of books. Go ahead. Keep it.

Oh, no. I... 

But I would like to read it again.

I promise I'll give it back.

Ok.

I'm confused.

Are you psychic or clairvoyant?

Technically, grams says I'm a witch.

My ancestors were these really cool

Salem witch chicks or something.

Grams tried to explain it all,

but she was looped on the liquor

so I kinda tuned out. Crazy family, yes.

Witches? I don't think so.

Yeah, well, feel free to conjure
up the name and number

of that guy from last night.

I didn't see him, you did.

Why didn't you just talk to him?

I don't know. I was drunk.

* I never know how to treat you *

* You say I love you but it ain't true *

* I like to grab you by the hair *

Hey, Tyler. Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.

I was just wondering how Vickie's doing,

since you guys are so close.

Is she ok?

She's fine. Now get out of here.

How bad is she?

Do they know what attacked her?

Is she going to make a full recovery?

Was she happy to see you?
What room number was she in?

I'm going to kick your ass.

Yeah, you keep saying that,

but when are you actually going to do it?

Huh? 'Cause I vote for right here and right now.

* I like to grab you by the hair *

Walk away, Gilbert.

It's your final warning.

No, this is your final warning, dick.

I'm sick of watching you play Vickie.

You hurt herne more time,
I swear to God, I will kill you.

* I like to grab you by the hair *

Damn, that was like a death threat.

Did you hear that?

They're keeping her overnight to make sure

There's no infection,

but she should be able to come home tomorrow.

That's good news.
Yeah.

Did you get in touch with your mom?

Called and left a message.

She's in Virginia Beach with her boyfriend,

so... we'll see how long it takes
her to come rushing home.

Vickie's lucky that she's ok.

I know, and now there's talk
of some missing campers.

Did she say what kind of animal
it was that attacked her?

She said it was a vampire.

What?

Yeah, she wakes up last night
and mutters "vampire"

and then passes out.

Ok, that is weird.

I think she was drunk.

So what's up with you and the new guy?

Matt, the last thing that I want to do is hurt you.

You know, I'm... 

I'm actually gonna go back to the hospital.

I want to be there when Vickie wakes up,

get the real story about last night.

Ok.

As Jeremy's teacher, I'm concerned.

All right? It's the third day of school

and he's skipped 6 of his classes.

Mr. Tanner,

are you aware that Jeremy
and Elena's parents died?

4 months ago, a great loss.

Car accident.

Wickery bridge, if I remember correctly.

And you're related to the family how?

The, uh, mother's kid sister?

Younger sister.

Right.
Yes.

6 classes? Are you sure?

I mean, that's kind of hard to do.

Not when you're on drugs.

It's his attempt at coping, Ms. Summers.

And the signs are there.

He's moody, withdrawn, argumentative,

hungover.

Are there any other relatives in the picture?

I'm their sole guardian.

Uh-huh.

Could there be?

What are you suggesting, exactly?

It's an impossible job, isn't it,

raising two teens?

It's been tough,

but, no, it's not.

Wrong answer.

It is an extremely impossible job,

and anything less and you're not doing it properly.

Whoa!

Vick.

Vickie, hey.

Vick, it's Matt. Hey, what's wrong?

No! No!

Get off!

No!

No!

No!

It was an animal that attacked you.

It came out of the night and jumped you.

You blacked out.

It's all you remember.
It's all I remember.

An animal attacked you. You blacked out.

It's all you remember.
It's all I remember.

Nurse! I need help!

It's my sister.

She seems fine.

Well, I was talking to grams,

and she said the comet is
a sign of impending doom.

The last time it passed over Mystic Falls,

there was lots of death.
So much blood and carnage,

it created a bed of paranormal activity.

Yeah, and then you poured grams another shot

and she told you about the aliens.

So then what?

So then nothing.

You and Stefan talked all night?

There was no sloppy first kiss

or touchy feely of any kind?

Nope.

We didn't go there.

Not even a handshake?

I mean, Elena,

we are your friends.

Ok? You are supposed to share the smut.

We just talked for hours.

Ok, what is with the blockage?

Just jump his bones already! Ok, it's easy.

Boy likes girl, girl likes boy,

sex.

Profound.

* ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

Where are you going?

Caroline's right. It is easy.

If I sit here long enough,

I'll end up talking myself out of it

instead of doing what I started
the day saying I was going to do.

* I trust you *

I picked up dinner. Tacos.

I had an urge for guacamole.

No, I'm good, thanks.

Eat anyway. It's a ruse.

I want to talk.

Hey, you! Come.

Sit.

Back in school, freshman year,

I could eat my weight in nachos,

with extra cheese.

It was my munchie food whenever I got stoned.

You get high?

Did.

Past tense.

But, yeah. Loved it.

Anything to get a little distraction

from life... reality.

And it worked.

For a while.

Never lasts, though.

Hey, I'm not saying I wouldn't
love to rail back and kick it,

but with a thesis looming

and a waistline expanding...

What the... 

Finally you're awake.

Hey. How are you feeling?

You look better.

I was worried before.

You really had me freaked
out with all that screaming.

Wait, what are you talking about?

You don't remember?

I feel fine.

Good, good.

Doctor said you could come home tomorrow.

Vick, what attacked you in the woods?

An animal.

What else could it have been?

Hey. How do you feel?

I'm ok.

I... I'm gonna... 

I'm gonna go grab a coffee.

Hey, Jer.

Why are you here?

I just wanted to see how you were doing.

Did you see that look on Matt's face?

That was suspicion. I don't want people

to find out about us, Jeremy.

Well, you gotta get over that.

Tyler is finally showing some interest.

You have to get over that, too.

Do you see Mr. Concerned?

Tyler? Are you under there?

No.

It's not cool for people to know.

Ok? I'm older than you,

and Matt and Elena would freak.

No one's going to suspect anything.

Why wouldn't I check on you?

I mean, I'm the one who found you.

You are?

Yeah, I carried you out of the woods.

Thank you.

Yeah, you're welcome.

Stefan?

Stefan?

I... I'm sorry for barging in. The door was...

Open.

You must be Elena.

I'm Damon, Stefan's brother.

He didn't tell me he had a brother.

Well, Stefan's not one to brag.

Please, come.

I'm sure Stefan will be along any second.

Wow.

This is your living room?

Living room, parlor, Sotheby's auction.

It's a little kitschy for my taste.

I see why my brother's so smitten.

It's about time. For a while there,

I never thought he'd get over the last one.

Nearly destroyed him.

The last one?

Yeah.

Katherine, his girlfriend?

Oh, you two haven't had the
awkward exes conversation yet.

Nope.

Oops. Well, I'm sure it'll come up now.

Or maybe he didn't want to tell you

because he didn't want you
to think he was on the rebound.

We all know how those relationships end.

You say it like

every relationship is doomed to end.

I'm a fatalist.

Hello, Stefan.

Elena.

I didn't know you were coming over.

I know. I should have called, I just... 

Oh, don't be silly. You're welcome any time.

Isn't she, Stefan?

You know, I should break out
the family photo albums,

or some home movies.

But... I have to warn you.

He wasn't always such a looker.

Thank you for stopping by, Elena.

Nice to see you.

Yeah, I should probably go.

It was nice to meet you, Damon.

Great meeting you, too, Elena.

Stefan?

Stefan?

Great gal.

Whoo. She's got spunk.

You, on the other hand, look pooped.

Did you over-exert yourself today?

Let me guess... hospital.

Someone had to clean up your mess.

Well, were you successful?

Did the powers of persuasion work?

Remember, if you don't feed properly,

none of those little tricks work right.

How long was Elena here?

Were you worried, Stefan?

Scared we may be doomed

to repeat the past?

Isn't that why you play your little
game, "I'm a high school human"?

I'm not playing any game.
Of course you are.

We both know

the closest you'll ever get to humanity

is when you rip it open and feed on it.

What kind of game are you playing...

Damien?

Guess you'll just have to wait and see, won't you?

He's on the rebound and has raging family issues.

Well, at least it's an ex-girlfriend.

Wait till you date a guy with mommy issues

or cheating issues.

Or amphetamine issues.

Jeremy.

Jeremy, where were you?

More stoner stories?

Look, Jenna, I get it, you were cool.

And so that's... that's cool.

Oh, no, no, no!

Ow! Why?

Why... why did you do that? Listen up!

Quit ditching class or you're grounded.

No discussion.

Parental authority, I like it.

Sleep tight.

* And I'm an animal *

* You're an animal, too *

Matt.

Mattie?

Tonight, night of the comet.

Would you like a program?

He didn't call, huh?

Or text.

But I realized we never even exchanged that stuff.

We've never gotten to the texting part.

That's an important milestone in any relationship.

Isn't it?
The timing is wrong, anyway.

When is it ever right?

I'm not ready, Bonnie.

Who is?

At least I put myself out there.

Is that what you're calling it?

What do you mean?

All I'm hearing is reasons why you can't.

* Get back down to street level *

* I get around *

* Here I come when I better go *

* I say yes when I ought to say no *

* Here I come when I better go *

* I say yes when I ought to say no *

What is Damon doing here? Why did he come home?

'Cause I came home.

He wants to make my life miserable.

That's how he enjoys his.

Well, he's putting us all at risk.

This girl in the hospital could talk.

She won't.

I took care of her.

You're sure?

I'm not sure, Zach.

I don't know how well it worked.

I'm not as strong as Damon.

So what happens if it doesn't work?

I don't know.

I'll deal with it.

Is she worth it?

Uncle Stefan, this girl you came back for.

Vickie, what are you doing here?

Fighting with Robert about my schedule.

You'd think getting ripped up by a rabid animal

would merit an extra sick day.
Are you feeling ok?

I hurt.

Well, the doctor gave you something, right?

The kid stuff.

Nothing with an "o" in it.

I think they were onto me.

Here. Knock yourself out, literally.

Thanks, Jer.

So you gonna, uh, watch the comet later?

I hadn't really thought about it.

But I could be talked into it.

I'll meet you out there in a few.

Hey, Vick. How you feeling?

Like you care.

What are you lookin' at, Gilbert?

Hey, I got some candles.

Hi.

Hey.
Hey.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Thank you.

Hi.

Hi.

You know, that comet...

it's been traveling across
space for thousands of years.

All alone.

Yeah, Bonnie says it's a harbinger of evil.

I think it's just a ball of...

snow and ice,

trapped on a path that it can't escape.

And once every 145 years,

it gets to come home.

I'm sorry about yesterday.

I wasn't myself.

You seem to spend a lot of time apologizing.

Well, I have a lot to apologize for.

Yesterday, that wasn't about you, ok?

You didn't tell me that you had a brother.

We're not close.

It's, uh...

it's complicated.

Always.

He told me about your ex, Catherine.

What did he say?

That she broke your heart.

That was a long time ago.

When you lose someone, it stays with you,

always reminding you of how easy it is to get hurt.

Elena...

It's ok, Stefan.

I get it.

You have no idea how much I get it.

Complicated brother? Check.

Complicated ex? Check.

Too complicated to even contemplate
dating, double check.

It's ok.

We met, and we talked,

and it was epic, but...

then the sun came up and reality set in

so...

I know you.

Well, that's unfortunate.

Um...

I don't... I don't know how,

but...

your face.

Excuse me. Sorry.

Hey, has anyone seen Vickie?

You're her stalker. You tell us.

I can't find her.

She probably found somebody else to party with.

Sorry, pill pusher, I guess you've been replaced.

What's with the pill pusher?

Ask him. You wanna do this right now?

Are you dealing?

She's never gonna go for you.

She already did.

Over and over and over again.

Yeah, right.

You slept with Vickie Donovan?

I mean, Vickie Donovan slept with you?

There's no way.

And I didn't even have to force her into it.

What the hell is he talking about, Todd?

Nothing, man, just ignore him, he's a punk.

You know what, how about all of you shut up

and help me find my sister?
We'll check the back.

I'll check the square. I'll come with you.

Oh, no, no, no.

You are coming with me.

So that's your game now, dealing?

I'm not dealing.
Look, I'm sick

of the tough love speech, Jer.
It's really having no impact.

You and Jenna, between the two of you...

We can stop if you want.

Send you to a therapist where
you'll be forced to deal with it

or to rehab where you'll sit in group

and tell some stranger how
you let your life fall apart.

Or you could talk to me.

I vote for none of the above.

Hey.

Hey.

Have you seen my sister?

No, sorry. I can't find her.

She's missing.

I'll keep an eye out for her.

Hey.

I saw you at the hospital yesterday.

Did you?

What were you doing there?

Visiting.

Visiting?

You know,

Elena and I, we've known
each other for a long time.

We might not be together right now,

but I look out for her.

And I'll always look out for her.

You really have to stop screaming.

No, please, stop. Don't...

Shh. I got you.

Excuse me.

No! No!

I gotta do it. I'm not gonna drop you.

Not bad.

Have you been eating bunnies?

Let her go.

Shh. really?

Ok.

No! No, no, no!

Uhh!

Relax.

What's happening?

I don't need her to be dead, but...

you might.

What attacked you the other night?

I don't know. An animal.

Are you sure about that?

Think.

Think about it. Think really hard.

What attacked you?

A vampire.

Who did this to you?
You did!

Wrong!
Don't.

It was Stefan. Don't.

Come here.

Stefan Salvatore did this to you.

Stefan Salvatore did this to me.

He's a vampire.

A vicious, murderous monster.

Please, Damon. Please don't do this.

If you couldn't fix it before,

I don't know what you can do now.

Aah!

Uhh!

Your choice of lifestyle

has made you weak.

A couple of vampire parlor tricks

is nothing compared to the
power that you cod have,

that you now need.

But you can change that.

Human blood gives you that.

No!

You have two choices.

You can feed and make her forget.

Or you can let her run, screaming
"vampire" through the town square.

That's what this is about?

You want to expose me?

No! I want you to remember who you are!

Why? So what, so I'll feed?

So I'll kill?

So I'll remember what it's like to be brothers again?

You know what, let her go.

Let her tell everyone that vampires

have returned to Mystic Falls.

Let them chain me up,

and let them drive a stake through my heart,

because at least I'll be free of you.

Huh.

Huh.

Wow.

Come here, sweetheart.

No! It's ok.

What happened?

Where am I?

Oh, I ripped my stitches open.

Ah...

You ok?

I took some pills, man.

I'm good.

It's good to be home.

Think I might stay a while.

This town could use a bit of a wake-up call,

don't you think?

What are you up to, Damon?

That's for me to know and for you to... dot dot dot.

Give Elena my best.

She said you found her wandering around.

Yeah.

So, um,

thanks.

Uhh, it's just so much drama.

Ever notice how the druggies

are the biggest attention whores?

Yeah.

Excuse me. hi.

Hi. Um, have you guys seen Elena?

I think she went home.

I'm gonna give you

Elena's cell number and her email.

She is big on texting,

and you can tell her...

I said so.

Thank you.

You ok?

What happened to you?

That's so rude.

I'm sorry. Excuse me.

Yeah, she kind of wigs out.

It's like her thing.

Jer?

N, it's me, the hypocrite patrol.

What are you doing?

I've become my worst nightmare.

The authority figure

who has to violate a 15-year-old's privacy.

Jackpot.

I see the hiding places ven't
gotten any more creative.

What brought
this on?

Your ass-hat of a history teacher
shamed me good yesterday.

You got tannered. Been there.

"Discover the impossible, Ms. Summers." Got it.

Thanks. Like I didn't know I was screwing up.

You're not screwing up, aunt Jenna.

Yes, I am.

You know why?

Because I'm not her.

She made everything look so easy.

You know, high school, marriage, having you.

I can't do it.

I'm gonna say or do the wrong thing,

and he's gonna get worse,
and it's gonna be my fault.

It's impossible.

This is just the fear talking.

You're a little scared,

that's all.

We all are.

I have to go do something.

But are you going to be ok?

Oh... whoo.

Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

No, it's fine.

Um... I was hoping I'd see you again.

I know.

Cocky much?

Very much.

Hi.

Hey.

* Something always brings me back to you *

Would you like to come in?

* You never take... *

The comet's actually this way.

* No matter what I say or do *

* Still feel you here *

* Till the moment I'm gone *

Sorry for barging in.

Especially after earlier.

No, no. I'm glad you're here.

The way we left things... I didn't like it.

See, the thing is,

I got home tonight planning on doing what I always do,

write in my diary,

like I have been since my mom
gave me one when I was 10.

It's where I get everything out, everything I'm feeling.

It all goes in this little book

that I hide on the second shelf

behind this really hideous ceramic mermaid.

But then I realized that I'd just be writing things

that I should probably be telling you.

What would you write?

I would write...

"Dear diary,

today I convinced myself it was ok to give up.

Don't take risks.

Stick with the status quo.

No drama, now is just not the time.

But my reasons aren't reasons, they're excuses.

All I'm doing is hiding from the truth,

and the truth is that..."

* Set me free *

I'm scared, Stefan.

I'm scared that if I let myself

be happy for even one moment that...

the world's just going to come crashing down,

and I...

I don't know if I can survive that.

* so talk *

Do you want to know what I would write?

* But you're onto me *

"I met a girl.

We talked.

It was epic."

* I live here on my knees *

"But then the sun came up and reality set in."

* Everything I think need here on the... *

"Well, this is reality.

Right here."

*I can't seem to let you go *

* The one thing that I still know *

* Is that you're keeping me *

* down *

* ooh *

* You're keeping me down *

* yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

* You're onto me *

* Onto me *

*All over *

Aah!

Good morning.

Please...

Don't.

Don't do that.

Ah, ah, ah.

No! No!

No!

Get away from me! No!

This could have gone a completely different way.

I'm not saying don't date the guy.

I'm just saying take it slow.

You were the one who said to go for it.

Now I'm saying take it slow.

Why the about-face?

It's not an about-face.

You're single for the first time

In your entire high school career.

It's the perfect time to play the field.

Oh, because I'm so that girl.

Seriously, what are you not saying?

It's stupid.

Bonnie...

What?
Spit it out.

I accidentally touched Stefan

And got a really bad feeling.

Is that it?

Bonnie.

It was bad bad!

Is the whole witch mojo thing again?

You know what? I'm just concerned.

This is me expressing concern

About my best friend's new boyfriend.

And I love you for it, I do.

But I feel good.

It's been a hard year,

and I'm starting to kind of feel like

things are getting back to normal again.

And you know what? Stefan is a big part of that.

I rock. I scored 2 tickets

to the Posers Saturday night.

They're playing at the rat.

You and tyler have fun.

Don't be like that.

Come on. I want you to go.

You're not worried everyone's going to know

you're screwing the stoner geek?

Oh, wait... everyone already knows.

Yeah. But it's not like that anymore,

so now we can be friends and just hang.

Tell me something, was it the drugs?

Were you sleeping with me because of the drugs?

Screw you.

No, if there's another reason,

please, I'm all ears.

Good morning, Elena.

Good morning, Bonnie.

Hey, um, I gotta find Caroline.

She's not answering her phone.

So I'll see you guys later.

Bonnie, wait...

She doesn't like me very much.

She doesn't know you.

She's my best friend. She's just looking out for me.

But when she does,

she will love you.

Look... 

there's Elena and her new boyfriend.

Now, what are they doing?

Oh, they're walking,

walking, walking.

Yep. Right into the sunset.

You're a dick.

While you just stand there
looking like one of those

little yard trolls.

Gnomes.

Here's what we're going to do.

Are you free tonight?

Yes.
Perfect.

Dinner, my house. 8:00.

You, me, and Bonnie.

You two will spend some quality time

and she'll get to see what a great guy you are.

Mission accomplished.

Hey, what am I supposed to do, Ty?

She made her choice.

Let her know she made the wrong one.

What are you doing?

Ty, don't.
Ty, don't!

Ty! Don't!

That throw was insane.

I didn't know you played football.

I used to. It was a long time ago.

So why don't you try out for the team?

Yeah, I don't think so.

So you don't like football?

No, I love football. I think it's a great sport.

But in this case,

I don't think football likes me.

You saw Tyler over there,

and we both know how Matt feels.

They don't know you.

To them, you're mysterious loner guy.

Wouldn't hurt to be part of.

Make some friends.
Says the girl

who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.

Hey, come on. There's more to me than just

gloomy graveyard girl.

There's a whole other Elena
that you have yet to meet.

She was into everything, very busy.

Well, I look forward to meeting her.

And when will that be?

Soon.

She's working on it.

World war II ended in...

Anyone got anything?

Miss Juan? 1945.

Psst. Fyi... 

Our team sucks. They could use you.

Can't.
Pearl Harbor.

I'm a loner.

Miss Gilbert?

Hmm? Pearl Harbor?

Um...

December 7, 1941.

Thank you, Miss Gilbert.

Anytime.

Very well.

The fall of the Berlin wall.

1989.

I'm good with dates, sir.

Are you?

How good?

Keep it to the year.

Civil Rights Act.

1964.

John F. Kennedy assassination.

1963.

Martin luther King.
'68.

Lincoln.
1865.

Roe vs. Wade.
1973.

Brown vs. Board.

1954.

The battle of Gettysburg.

1863.

Korean war.

1950 to 1953.

Ha! It ended in '52.

Uh, actually, sir,

it was '53.

Look it up, somebody.

Quickly.

It was 19... 53.

How did you know all of that?

Years and years of crossword puzzles.

It's a loner thing.

Nice job! Nice job!

Mr. Lockwood, is there
anything you're good at?

'Cause it isn't history,

and it sure as hell isn't defending the ball!

Yes, coach.

Now do it again!

Oh, my God! You're here!

Yep. I can't be sad girl forever.

The only way to get things back to the way they were

are to do things that were.

Oh, and you're coming to dinner tonight.

I am?
Mm-hmm.

You and me and Stefan.

You have to give him
a chance.

Tonight's no good.

Have you seen caroline?

I texted her like a hundred times.

Don't change the subject, Bonnie Bennett.

You're going to be there.

Fine. I'll go.

Good.

Varsity trials were last spring, Mr. Salvatore.

I wasn't
here then, sir.

And you're not here now, as far as I'm concerned.

Mr. Tanner, I realize that you and I

didn't get off to the best start,

And I want to apologize for that.

I've played football before.

Wide receiver, mostly, and I'm pretty good.

Well, I won't be asking you
who won the super bowl in '71.

'71 was the...

Sorry. I... I understand that, sir.

Just to see you get knocked on your ass.

Borrow some gear.

Go!

Before I change my mind. Let's run it again!

First my girlfriend, now the team?

Dude, this is an opportunity.

Football's a contact sport.

Sometimes people get hurt.

Whoo!

Ha ha!

Seriously, where is caroline?

I don't know. It's not like her.

Try her again.

Uh...

Oh, my God.

That must be the mystery guy from the grill.

That's not a mystery guy.

That's Damon Salvatore.

Salvatore, as in Stefan?

I got the other brother.

Hope you don't mind.

Sorry I'm late, girls.

I, uh, was busy.

All right, let's start with the
double pike herkey hurdler,

what do you say?

And 5, 6, 7, 8.

1, 2, 3, 4,

5, 6, 7, 8.

1, 2, 3, 4,

5, 6, 7, 8.

Elena, sweetie, why don't you just observe today?

Ok?

Keep going! Ok. Do it again from the top.

And 5, 6, 7, 8.

1, 2, 3, 4,

5, 6, 7, 8.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

7, 8.

Blue lady!

Blue lady!

Set, hut! Go!

Come on, Tyler, cover it!

Let's do it.

Get it.

Line up!

I hate to say it, but he's got skills.

I think he needs a buddy pass.

Really?

You don't get to walk on the field

And act like you own the place after 5 minutes.

Just hang one up there
and I'll take care of the rest.

Do it again.

All right, let's huddle up.

Set, hut!

Oh!

Whoo!

Welcome to the team, buddy.

Let's go.

You gonna live, Salvatore?

Yeah.

Walk it off, son.

Hey. That was my bad.

It's all right.

Hey.

All right.

How were tryouts?

Did you make the team?

Very Emerson, the way you reveal
your soul with so many... 

Adjectives.

What are you doing here?

I've come to apologize.

I've been doing some thinking,

some soul searching, and...

I want us to start over.

We need to put the past behind us.

You're my little brother,

and if you want to live

a normal, happy human life,

Then I want that for you.

Maybe I can do it, too.

That I can learn to be a non-living

living person.

Maybe there's hope for both of us.

You know, it doesn't have to be this way, Damon.

Of course it doesn't.

I saw Elena today, btw.

That means "by the way."

She was at cheerleading practice.

She looked so perky in her little short shorts.

Just...

simmer down, I didn't even go near her.

I've got my own cheerleader now.

Ooh, that reminds me... 

I gotta run. I have a date.

Sweaty palms.

Wish me luck.

You explain it.

Last night, I'm watching Nine-o,

a commercial breaks come on and I'm like,

I bet it's that phone commercial. And sure enough,

it's that guy and the girl with the bench,

he flies to Paris and he flies back.

They take a picture. Oh, come on.

That commercial's on a constant loop.

Fine.

Well, how about this?

Today I'm obsessed with numbers.

3 numbers. I keep seeing 8, 14, and 22.

How weird is that?

Maybe we should play the lottery.

Have you talked to your grams?

She's just gonna say it's because I'm a witch.

I don't want to be a witch. Do you want to be a witch?

I don't want to be a witch.

And putting it in a nice bowl

isn't fooling anybody.

Ok, serving spoons.

Where are the serving spoons?

Little drawer on your left.

Ok, so you've been in this
kitchen like a thousand times.

Yeah, that's it.

Ok, he's here.

Don't be nervous. Just be your normal loving self.

Birthday candles.

Did tanner give you a hard time today?

Well, he let me on the team,

so I must have done something right.

Bonnie, you should have seen Stefan today.

Tyler threw a ball right at him, and... 

Yeah, I heard.

Why don't you tell Stefan about your family?

Um, divorced. No mom. Live with my dad.

Hmm.

No, about the witches.

Bonnie's family has a lineage of witches.

It's really cool.

Cool isn't the word I'd use.

Well, it's certainly interesting.

I'm not too versed,

But I do know that there's

A history of celtic druids

that migrated here in the 1800s.

My family came by way of Salem.

Really?

Salem witches?

Yeah.

I would say that's pretty cool.

Really? Why?

Salem witches are heroic examples

of individualism

and nonconformity.

Yeah, they are.

I wonder who that could be.

Surprise!

Bonnie said you were doing dinner,

so we brought dessert.

Oh. Hope you don't mind.

What are you doing here?

Waiting for Elena to invite me in.

Oh, yeah, you can... 
No, no, no.

He can't, uh...

he can't stay.

Can you, Damon?

Get in here.

We're just... finishing up.

It's fine. Just come on in.

You have a beautiful home, Elena.

Thank you.

I cannot believe that Mr. Tanner let you on the team.

Tyler must be ceiling.

But good for you. Go for it.

That's what I always tell him. You have to engage.

You can't just sit there and
wait for life to come to you.

You have to go get it.

Yeah, Elena wasn't so lucky today.

It's only because you missed summer camp.

God, I don't know how you're ever
going to learn the routines.

I'll work with her. She'll get it.

I guess we can put her in the back.

You know, you don't seem like

the cheerleader type, Elena.

Oh, it's just 'cause her parents died.

Yeah, I mean, she's just

totally going through a blah phase.

She used to be way more fun.

And I say that with complete sensitivity.

I'm sorry, Elena.

I know what it's like to lose both your parents.

In fact, Stefan and I have watched
almost every single person

we've ever cared about die.

We don't need to get into that right now, Damon.

Oh, you know what, you're right, Stef. I'm sorry.

The last thing I wanted to do was bring her up.

Mmm.

Don't do that.

Not while I'm working.

I'll see you later.

I'll be right back.

She's my sister and I love her,

but sometimes she can
really make you work for it.

I find it pretty easy.

All right, I get it. Hitting me to impress her. That's... 

That's real nice.

I don't need to impress her.

I already won.

Now you're dead.
Am I? 'Cause it seems like

I'm standing here waiting for you to man up.

Ty, don't!

The next time I see you, gilbert...

No, next time I see you.

What are you doin', Vick?

One more.

Oh, thank you.

Nice save.

I like you.

You know how to laugh.

And you make Stefan smile,

which is something I haven't seen

in a very long time.

Earlier, did you mean... Katherine?

Mm-hmm.

How did she die?

In a fire. Tragic fire.

Recently?

Well, it seems like it was yesterday.

What was she like?

She was beautiful.

A lot like you in that department.

She was just very complicated

and selfish and at times not very kind,

but very sexy and seductive.

So which one of you dated her first?

Nicely deduced.

Ask Stefan.

I'm sure his answer differs from mine.

I'd quit cheerleading if I were you.

Why do you say that?

Oh, I saw you at practice. You looked miserable.

You saw that?

Uh-huh.

I used to love it. It was fun.

Things are different this year.

Everything that used to matter doesn't anymore.

So don't let it.

Quit, move on. Problem solved.

Ta-da.

Some things could matter again.

Maybe.

But... seems a little unrealistic to me.

I'm sorry.

About Katherine.

You lost her, too.

Hey.

Need some help?

Sure, why not?

Matt tries, but he's just having a really hard time.

You have to understand that

they were each other's first.

You know, like, from the sandbox.

That's a really nice scarf.

Mm. Thank you, it's new.

Can I see it?

I mean, would you mind taking it off?

Oh, I can't.

Why not? You ok?

Um...

All I know is that I can't take it off.

What are you two kids talking about?

I was just commenting on her scarf.

Hmm. Hey, you know, um,

Elena and Bonnie are finishing up the dishes.

Why don't you go see if you can help?

Does it look like I do dishes?

For me?

Hmm... I don't think so.

Go see if Elena needs help in the kitchen.

You know what?

I'm gonna go see if Elena needs
some help in the kitchen.

Great.

They are people, Damon.

She's not a puppet.

She doesn't exist for your amusement,

for you to feed on whenever you want to.

Sure she does.

They all do.

They're whatever I want them to be.

They're mine for the taking.

All right, you've had your fun.

You used Caroline, you got to me and Elena,

good for you.

Now it's time for you to go.

That's not a problem.

Because...

I've been invited in,

and I'll come back tomorrow night

and the following night

and I'll do with your little cheerleader

whatever I want to do.

Because that is what is normal to me.

Tonight wasn't so bad. I had fun.

Hmm. That makes one of us.

Come on.

Your brother isn't as bad as you make him out to be...

There must be a shred of humanity
left inside my brother.

Somewhere.

I keep hoping.

But how do I make him see it?

And how do I protect her?

Ooh.

Look at you. You look hot in your jersey.

What happened? No more cheerleader?

I quit. I'm a quitter.

No, hey, you're not a quitter.

You suffered a great loss.
You're not the same person.

You should be looking ahead.

You should be starting over.

Ok?

I hope you don't think this is

too soon or too weird, but...

I, uh,

I wanted you to have this.

Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

It's something that I've had forever,

and, uh, I've never wanted to
give it to anyone until now.

I'd very much like it if you'd wear it for me,

for... good luck.

Is that rose that I smell?

No, it's, uh... it's an herb.

It's nice, huh?

I love it.

And, uh,

I wanted to thank you

for pushing me to try out for the team.

It feels really good.

We're a pair.

I quit, you start.

Right. 

We're a work in progress.

We'll figure it out.

And you're not in uniform because...

Wait, wait, wait,

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Wait. Let's be honest here.

In the past, we used to let other teams

come into our town and roll right over us!

But that is about to change.

We've got some great new talent

tonight starting on the offensive line,

and I'm gonna tell you right now,

it has been a long time

since I have seen a kid like this

with hands like these.

This blows.

He can't start the guy. He just got here.

That have been waiting for us

to put a check in the win column,

I have only one thing to say to you... 

Your Timberwolves are hungry.

Hey, you. What's wrong?

Nothing. And the central high lions

are what's for dinner!

Is that Jeremy?

Wait, no! Ty! No.

Oh, what do you care?

Don't look so down.

You can have her when I'm done.

Tyler, stop it!

Tyler! Tyler, stop!

Stop it!

Stop, you're hurting him!

Tyler!

Tyler, stop!

Tyler!

Stop it! Tyler, stop!

Hey, he's down! Enough!

Jeremy, no!

Get off me! Stop!

What the hell, Jeremy?

Put your head up, you're bleeding.

I'm fine!

Yeah, you smell fine.

Just stop, ok?

Come on, man. Come on.

Oh, my God, your hand.

No, no, no, it's fine.

Is it deep? How bad is it?

Come on!

But... I saw it, it was... 

He missed.

It's not my blood.

See? I'm fine.
No, no, no.

I... I saw it. The glass cut your hand. It was... 

It's ok. I'm ok.

It's almost kick-off time, all right?

So, um,

I'll, uh, I'll see you after the game.

Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly.

Can you stand straight, please?

Could someone please help Tiki?

Hey! Where you been?

Can I ask you a question

And you give me a really serious no-joke response?

Of course. What is it?

The bad mojo.

When you touched Stefan
and you had that reaction...

You know what, forget I said that.

Your little dinner party plot totally won me over.

No, Bonnie, seriously. What was it?

Did you see something,

Or...

it wasn't clear like a picture.

Like today, I keep seeing

those same numbers I told you about... 

8, 14, 22.

Yeah? When I touched Stefan,

it was a feeling.

And it vibrated through me,
and it was cold, and it... 

And what?

It was death.

It's what I imagine death to be like.

You scared me. What are you doing here?

I'm hiding from Caroline.

Aand why is that?

I needed a break.

She talks more than I can listen.

That could be a sign.

Well, she's awfully young.

Not much younger than you are.

I don't see it going anywhere in the bigger picture.

I think she'd drive me crazy.

Caroline does have

Some really annoying traits,

but we've been friends since the first grade

and that means something to me.

Duly noted. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable.

That's not my intention.

Yes, it is.

Otherwise you wouldn't
put an alternate meaning

behind everything you say.

You're right.

I do have other intentions, but so do you.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

I see 'em.

You want me.

Excuse me?

I get to you. You find yourself drawn to me.

You think about me even when you
don't want to think about me.

I bet you even dreamed about me.

And right now...

You want to kiss me.

What the hell?

I don't know what game you're
trying to play with Stefan here,

but I don't want to be part of it.

And I don't know what happened in the past,

but let's get one thing straight... 

I am not Katherine.

You gonna be able to play?

Oh, yeah, I'm good.

Uh, what you did back there...

you had Jeremy's back.

Ah, he's a messed-up kid.

Somebody's gotta look out for him.

I know.

This week at practice I was a dick.

Had your reasons.

No excuse.

Good luck tonight.

We're lucky to have you.

Isn't that nice?

Stefan joins a team, makes a friend.

It's all so, "rah, rah, go team, yeah!"

Not tonight.

I'm done with you.

Nice trick with Elena.

Let me guess... vervain in the necklace?

I admit, I was a bit surprised.

It's been a while since anyone
could resist my compulsion.

Where'd you get it?

Does it matter?

Guess I could just seduce
her the old-fashioned way.

Or I could just... eat her.

No.

You're not gonna hurt her, Damon.

No?

Because deep down inside,

there is a part of you

that feels for her.

I was worried that you had no humanity

left inside of you,

that you may have actually become the monster

that you pretend to be.

Who's pretending?
Then kill me.

Well, I'm... I'm tempted.

No, you're not.

You've had lifetimes to do it,

and yet, here I am. I'm still alive.

And there you are.

You're still haunting me.

After 145 years.

Katherine is dead.

And you hate me

because you loved her,

and you torture me because you still do.

And that, my brother,

is your humanity.

Salvatore!

What the hell? We've got a game to play!

If that's my humanity...

then what's this?

Aah!
No!

Anyone, anytime, any place.

Tanner's M.I.A. I think he had a little bit too much beer.

Don't talk to me right now,
all right? I'm pissed at you.

What's your problem?
What's my... 

You're my problem, all right?

You're a bully.

A freakin' 12-year-old bully, man.

And I'm sick of it.

I mean, what was that about tonight?

What's beating up the new guy going to prove?

Or screwing with my sister

or pummeling my girlfriend's kid brother.

Girlfriend? Look, I don't know how to tell you this,

but she dumped your ass.

Are you for real?! You want to hit me?

I'm on your team.

This was over the line.

Even for you.

Somebody help!

It wasn't just for the drugs.

What kind of animal could be doing all this?

Why would it come out of the woods

And attack someone in the middle of town?

I don't know.

I don't know.

I was so sure that you cut your hand.

I saw it.

I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine, ok?

We're fine.

That's what matters.

I thought there was hope

that somewhere deep inside,

something in Damon was still human,

Normal.

But I was wrong.

There's nothing human left in Damon.

No good, no kindness.

No love.

Only a monster

Who must be stopped.

For over a century I have
lived in secret,

Until now.
I know the risks,
but I have to know her.

I'm Elena.

I'm Stefan.
I'm Damon.

You didn't tell me
that you had a brother.

It's complicated.

Elena is a dead
ringer for Katherine.

Which one of you
dated her first?

Katherine is dead,
and you hate me

Because you loved her.

I was hoping
I'd see you again.

She's not a puppet.

She doesn't exist
for your amusement;

For you to feed on
whenever you want to.

They're whatever
I want them to be.

Wear it for me,
for...good luck.

You want to kiss me.

Vervain in the necklace.

It's been a while
since anyone could
resist my...compulsion.

There's nothing
human in Damon.

No good,
no kindness, no love.

Only a monster
who must be stopped.

Hello?

Jeremy?

Hello?

Man on tv:
this is logan fell
coming to you live

From the streets
of Mystic Falls

With breaking news
of another deadly
animal attack.

The wild animal terrorizing
the citizens of Mystic Falls

Has claimed another victim,

Local high school student
Elena gilbert.

Police are certain
that forensic eviden
will confirm

That this is the same animal
responsible for recent attacks.

You know
it's coming next.

Jeremy!

Ah!

Bad dream?

Ah.

Do you know how easy it was
to get into your head just now?

You really need
some human blood.

It might even
the playing field.

Football reference.

Too soon.

All right,
I deserved that.

But I just wanted
to let you know,

They caught the culprit.

The animal responsible
for killing coach tanner
and all those people.

What are you
talking about?

It was a mountain lion.
Really big one.

It attacked
a hunter this morning.
It's all over the news.

"Deadly beast captured.

All's well
in Mystic Falls."

Why would you
cover your tracks?

I've decided
to stay a while.

I'm just having
way too much fun here
with you and Elena.

Can't touch her now.

Well, the vervain
keeps me

Out of her head.

Maybe that's not
my target.

Believe it or not,
Stefan, some girls
don't need my persuasion.

Some girls just can't
resist my good looks,

My style and my charm

And my unflinching ability

To listen
to taylor swift.

This is john varvatos, dude.

Dick move.

I can confirm
that a 12-Foot
puma mountain lion

Attacked a hunter
and was subsequently
shot and killed.

The hunter is in
stable condition.

The real animal
is still out there,

Waiting for me,
challenging me
to fight back,

To stop him.

But how do I stop a monster
without becoming one myself?

To repeat, the animal
terrorizing Mystic Falls
has been caught.

Scum ball.

Scum bucket.

Who are you talking to?

Him.

The news guy, also known
as logan "scum" fell.

Did your mom ever
tell you why I moved
away from Mystic Falls?

Oh, no way.

You and him?

This is logan fell.

He's cute.

He is not cute.

There's nothing cute
about him.

What are you doing
with that?

I went yesterday and got it
from the safe deposit box.

Mom had told mrs. Lockwood
she would loan it

To the founder's council
for their heritage display.

Is that grandma
beth's wedding ring?

Originally it was
great-Great-Grandma mary's
wedding ring.

How much do you think
this stuff is worth?

You know, like on ebay?

You're not gonna find out.

That stuff is mom
and dad's. You can't
just give it away.

I'm not giving it away.

It's called a loan, jeremy.
[Doorbell rings]

Hi.

Hi.

Are you ok?

I'm good.

Sorry.

Maybe we should
press pause.

Yeah, you're probably right.

That was getting a bit...

Yeah.
Yeah.

How do you look
in a suit?

I can pull one off.
How about tomorrow night?

Will you be my date
to the founder's party?

They still do that?

Have you been before?

No, the salvatores

Don't get
invited anymore.

Well, this year,
there's this
heritage project

That meant a lot to my mom.

She was really involved
in the founder's council,

And it was
her favorite party.

I know it sounds
really boring, but--

I would be honored
to accompany you,

Miss gilbert.

The pleasure is all mine,
mr. Salvatore.

No yellow. Jaundice.
Go for the blue.

I don't like the blue.

Well, I do.

And if I'm gonna
be your date--

You cannot be my date.

My mother is going
to be there,

And she is a very proud
gun owner.

I went through
a lot of trouble

To make sure this party
wasn't cancelled.

It's very important
I be there.

Please take me.

You should come
to the founder's
party with me.

Not if you're wearing
that dress.

At's so special
about this bella girl?

Edward's so whipped.

You gotta read
the first book first.

It won't make sense
if you don't.

Ah, I miss anne rice.
She was so on it.

How come
you don't sparkle?

Because I live in
the real world,

Where vampires
burn in the sun.

Yeah, but you go
in the sun.

I have a ring.
It protects me.

Long story.

Will these bites
turn me into a vampire?

It's more
complicated than that.

You'd have to feed
on my blood, then die,

Then feed on a human's,
whole ordeal.

This book, by thwawa
has it all wrong.

You can be very sweet
when you want to be.

Yes, I can be sweet.

Are you going to kill me?

Mm-Hmm.

But not yet.

Why not?

Because there's
something I need you
to do for me.

Anything.

How good are you
at getting
this little nose

Where it doesn't
belong?

Oh, I'm excellent.

Mmm.

So what happens
with the season?

One big forfeit?
Are they looking
for a new coach?

I don't know, dad.

I doubt anybody's
thinking about that right now.

Charles,
founder's party, focus.

How are y'all
doing over here?

Ah, we're doing
great, sweetheart.

Is there anything else
I can get you?

We're fine, thanks.

Just the check, honey.

Here you go,
mayor lockwood.
Thanks.

You're taking Damon
to the founder's
party? What about me?

Go with Elena.

She's asking Stefan.

Ok, go by yourself.

Gee, thanks.
What about your mom?

Is she ok with you
bringing Damon?

And I'm supposed to care why?

He's older
sexy danger guy.

Older sexy danger guy?

Is that an official
witch twitter tweet?

No more
witch jokes, ok?

At whole mr. Tanner
prediction thing
has me freaked.

Ok.

And Damon's not dangerous.

You know, he just
has a lot of issues
with his brother.

You know, like major,
deep-Rooted drama.

Like...?

I'm not really supposed
to say anything.

Caroline forbes,
when have you ever kept
a secret in your life?

Ok.

But you can't tell Elena.

No.

So what you
gonna buy me?

Ugh, some class.

Oh, your parents are gone.
I guess  can bebclose now.

What the hell
does that mean?

You treat me like trash.
I'm sick of it.

I don't think
you're trash.

Really?
Then who are you taking

To the founder's party?

Vicki donovan.

Do you want me
to ask you to
the founder's party?

No.

It'll be stupid and lame.

True.

But it'll be less
stupid and lame
if you were there.

You realize
you had to ask him
to ask you, right?

You figure
if you dress up like

A respectable
young lady,

He'll finally
treat you like one?

Screw you, jeremy.

You know you're making
the wrong choice,

Yet you make it anyway.

It's sad.

I didn't know
you were here.

Just going through
Stefan's homework.

Boy, this country
sure has dumbed down

In the last
hundred years.

Why he wants
to go to high school
is beyond me.

I mean, in the seventies,
he went ivy league.

Harvard, I understood.

Actually, no. I didn't
get that either.

Go ahead, purge.

Get it out.
What's on your mind?

Why are you here, Damon?

To spend time
with you, zach.

Family's important.

I know you.

You always have a motive.

So tell me,
what is it this time?

You are in no position
to question me.

I didn't
mean to upset you.

This is not
upset, zach.

What's going on?

Having a family
moment, Stefan.

Spending some
quality time.

Hey, are you ok?

No, I'm not.

And neither are you.

How many more people
have to die before
you see that?

I see it.
All right, zach, I see it.

Then why aren't you
doing anything about it?

I can't, zach.

I can't.

It would take human blood.

It's the only way
that I could stop him,
and I can't do that.

The vervain
could weaken him

If he ingested it.

It would help get you
the upper hand.

Vervain hasn't grown here
since 1865.

Damon saw to that.

The little I had,
I gave to Elena.

What?

You've been
growing it.

It's just something
that's been passed down
through the generations.

Blood only runs
so deep when you're
related to vampires.

Damon would
kill me if he knew
that I had it.

But you're telling me.

Why?

Because I trust you.

And you're gonna
need it if you want
to get rid of him.

I'm here for my mom.
I was supposed to pick
up a box of stuff.

Right here.

Please be careful.

Yeah,  careful
with it, dick.

Hey! Not now,
ok, guys? Please?

I'm fine. He's just
being a punk.

I got your punk.
Look, Tyler,

Maybe you should go.
Tell your mom that
I'll see her tonight.

Hey.

Would it make
a difference

If I told you
I actually like vicki?

Not even if you meant it.

Delicate flower
vs. Naughty vixen.

Tough call.
Can we mix them?

Look at you,
getting all pretty
for your date.

You seem happy-Ish.

I am...ish.

Tonight's going
to be a good night.

But don't let that
stop you

From telling me
whatever it is

You wanted to tell
me as soon as you
walked in the door.

What if I tell you
in the morning?

I don't want
to ruin the night.

Bonnie, out with it.

Ok, but it has to go
in the vault,

Because Caroline
will kill me

If it gets back to Damon
that she squealed.

Apparently Stefan has
a very interesting back story.

Uh-Huh.

Do you know what happened
with his ex-Girlfriend
Katherine?

I know that
they both dated her

And that's why
they have issues.

Yeah, they both dated her,
only she chose Damon.

And that drove Stefan mad,
he did horrible things

To try and break them up.

He manipulated Katherine.

He filled her head
with all these lies
until finally

It worked,
and she turned against Damon.

That sounds like
one person's side
of the story,

Meaning Damon's.

I just wanted you to know.

Anyway, his past
relationships

Are none of my business.

Unless he's a calculating,
manipulative liar.

That is your business.

Stefan is none
of those things.

Yeah? How do you know?

Do they still wear ties
at this thing?

Why are you
even going?

It's only
fitting.

We were at the very
first one, remember?

I think it's better
if we don't draw
attention to ourselves.

So you should
stay here.

I'll see to it
Elena has a good time.

My goodness,
I've driven you
to drink.

Can't seem
to rid myself of you.

What else am I
supposed to do,

Besides go about
living my life?

Go about living
my life.

See, therein lies
your eternal struggle.

You're dead, dude.

Get over it.

What do you think?

Hello?

Hi, mrs. Lockwood.

What do you mean? It is?

Are you sure?

'Cause I saw it.

Let me check.

Mm-Hmm.

I will find it
and bring it.

Ok. Bye.

What's wrong?

Ahh! God, what now?

The pocket watch.
Where is it?

What watch?

The one you stole
from mom's box.

Look, mrs. Lockwood
just called me,
freaking out.

It was on the list,
jeremy.

And she can't find it,
and she thinks she's
the one who lost it.

Maybe she did.
Maybe Tyler took it.

Don't even play that card.
Jeremy, you took it.

If I go online, am I going
to find it on ebay?

Is that how you pay
for your pot?

Screw you.

I would never sell this, ok?

Then why did you
take it?

Because it's supposed
to be mine.

Dad said it goes
to the firstborn son.

His father gave it to him,
and now what?

And he was going
to give it to you.

Yeah.

Look, jeremy,
it's still yours, ok?

Mom promised mrs. Lockwood.

What do you want me to do?

Just take it
and get out.

It's cool
not growing old.

I like being
the eternal stud.

Yes, being
a 150-Year-Old teenager

Has been the height
of my happiness.

You cracked
a funny, Stefan.

I should have a drink
to celebrate.

1864.

You and Katherine
were the perfect couple.

It was hell watching you
dance with her.

My happiness was short-Lived,
as you well know.

I remember.

I left the party early,
I was waiting for her.

The night you dropped
her off, I was
waiting just inside.

You were such
a gentleman,

Gave her a kiss
on the cheek.

And what she really
wanted was...

Oh, well.

Here's to history
repeating itself, huh?

I admire
your effort, Stefan.

Pouring yourself a drink

Then spiking the bottle
with vervain.

I'm not some drunk
sorority chick.

You can't roofie me.

But I can't help
but feel a little used.

I thought we were
having a moment.

I have to go
to the party angry.

Who knows
what I'll do?

Hi, nice to see you.

Hi.
How are you?

Uh, let's go this way.

Why?

Line's too long.

We can go around back.

Come on,
party's in the back.

That was his favorite scotch.

I'm sorry,
I thought it would work.

I wasn't
counting on it.

You knew it would fail?

Did what I wanted.

It lowered
his guard.

You won't expect me
to try again so soon.

I doubled what
I put in the scotch.

Caroline!

You look smashing.

Thank you,
mrs. Lockwood.

This is my boyfriend
Damon.

Oh, well,
come on in.

Lovely to meet you.

I've been looking forward
to this party for quite a while.

Well, enjoy.

Wait here.

Really, you couldn't
even change out of
the badge for this?

I'm working, honey.

Who's the date
you just tried
to sneak past me?

Just some guy.

He's a little
old for you,
don't you think?

Oh, 'cause otherwise
you'd approve.

Yeah, I doubt that.

Hi, mayor lockwood.

Hey. Hey, guys,
come on in.

Thank you.

Where's your dad?

Memphis.
Good.

With stephen.

Your parents?

There's a lot of history here.

Jenna.

It's good to see you.

I thought
I might see you here.

You knew it.

I dreaded.

But were secretely
hoping.

And now that I have...

Whoa, hey, not so fast.

I know you. You have
a lot more insults
in you, I can tell.

Your hairline's receding.

No, it's not.
You want to have lunch?

Nope.
You haven't
changed a bit.

Oh, yes, I have.

I'm meaner now.

"The founding families
in Mystic Falls welcomes you

To the inaugural
founder's council
celebration."

Wow, look,
it's the original
guest registry.

Look at all these
familiar names--

Sheriff william forbes,

Mayor benjamin lockwood.

Is that Damon Salvatore?

And, look,
Stefan Salvatore.

The original
Salvatore brothers.

Our ancestors.
Tragic story, actually.

We don't need to
bore them with stories
of the past.

It's not boring,
Stefan.

I'd love to hear more
about your family.

Well, I'm bored.
I want to dance.

And Damon won't
dance with me.

Mm-Mmm.

Could I just
borrow your date?

Oh, uh...

I n't really dance.
Oh, sure he does.

You should see him.

Waltz,
the jitterbug,
the moonwalk.

He does it all.

You wouldn't mind,
would you, Elena?

It's up to Stefan.

I want to apologize to you

For being such
a world-Class jerk

The other night
when I tried to kiss you.

There's no excuse.

My therapist says I'm...

Acting out,
trying to punish Stefan.

[Chuckles] for what?

It's all in the past.
I don't even want
to bring it up.

Let's just say that the men
in the Salvatore family

Have been cursed
with sibling rivalry.

And it all started
with the original
Salvatore brothers.

Damon told you
to ask me to dance.

Didn't he?

Now why uld he do that?

Would you like one?

Thank you.

Ok, just tell me
if you see my mom.

The Salvatore name
was practically royalty
in this town.

Until the war.
There was a battle here--

The battle
of willow creek.

Right.

I know, we talked
about it in class.

Confederate soldiers
fired on a church
with civilians inside.

What the history books
left out

Was the people
that were killed.

They weren't there
by accident.

They were believed to be
union sympathizers.

So some of the founders
on the confederacy side
back then

Wanted them rounded up
and burned alive.

Stefan and Damon
had someone they loved

Very much
in that church.

And when they went
to rescue them,

They were shot.

Murdered
in cold blood.

Who was in the church
that they wanted to save?

A woman, I guess.

Doesn't it always
come down

To the love
of a woman?

Look, I'm sorry
that you and Stefan

Have this thing between you,

But I can't get in
the middle of it, Damon.

I just...

I hope you two
can work it out.

I hope so, too.

So you want to dance?

Me dancing?

Not pretty.

Maybe you could
show me around.

I mean,
this place is amazing.

Yeah, if you like
living in a museum.

Maybe I should just
strip naked

And give pastor bill
a lap dance.

I mean, that's why
we're hiding in a corner
all night, isn't it?

You're scared of how
I'm going to act?

You afraid of what
your parents are going
to think about your date

From the wrong side
of the tracks?

I don't care about
what they think.

Great. Let's go say hi.

Knock it off, vick.

Or we could just,
you know, sneak up
to your bedroom.

As long as nobody
sees us, right?

Vicki, I swear...
what's a matter, Ty?

You scared to stand up
to your mommy?

It's pretty pathetic.

Let go!
Tyler...

We didn't get a chance
to say hello earlier.

It's vicki, right?
Matt's sister.

Yes, ma'am.

You'll have to forgive
my son's rudeness.

He gets it
from his father.

Well, that's ok,
mrs. Lockwood.

Tyler and I were just
saying good night.

That's what you get
when you bring the trash
into the party.

What'd we miss?

We were just chatting.

Drink, Damon?

No, thanks,
I'll pass.

Stefan, do you have
another dance in you?

Absolutely.

They look so cute
together.

Don't talk, please.

Don't shoot!

I'm going to need
a refill.

Shooting implies caring.

Feigned indifference.
I like it.

I'm over the banter, logan.

I'd really rather
you just left me alone.

I'm sorry, Jenna.

About your sister.

Thank you.

Came to the funeral.

I know.

I saw you.

Yeah, I didn't want
to push my way in,

But I wanted to be
there for you.

And when I heard
you were staying
in Mystic Falls,

I thought maybe...

Well, maybe I could
have a second chance
to make things right.

Her name was Monica,
wasn't it?

I hope Damon didn't
drive you too crazy.

No, actually,
he was on good behavior.

He even apologized

and explained why he is
the way he is.

And it all goes back
to Katherine.

Hmm.

So tell me about her.

What happened?

It's not something
I like to talk about.

I get that. I do.

I just want you to
know that you can.

I mean, I burden you
with all of my drama,

And I want you
to do the same.

I know.

Thank you.

The truth is, Stefan...

I don't really know
that much about you,

And I'd really love it
if you would open up to me.

Damon said something,
didn't he?

He likes to play games
and cause trouble, Elena.

This isn't about Damon,
it's about me trying
to get to know you.

Look, you're the mystery guy,
and I like that.

But with mystery
comes secrets,

And this thing with Katherine.

Let it go.
I don't want
to talk about it.

Well, then, say something
about yourself. Anything.

Otherwise, I'm left
with nothing but what
other people tell me.

Don't you see what
Damon has done here?

He's trying to get you
to turn against me.

Well, then I guess
it's working.

This is my fault.
I planted doubt.

I'm a doubt planter.

It's not your fault.

I just--
I feel terrible

Because I said that
I wouldn't get in
the middle of it,

And that's exactly
what I did.

I got all snotty.

Elena, honey,
there you are.

I notice the watch
still isn't in
the collection.

Oh, um, I'm sorry,
mrs. Lockwood.

I, um, I couldn't find it.

I guess it's still
packed up in my parents'
stuff somewhere.

I see.

Well, please
let me know
if you do find it.

Ok.

Where have you been?

Ah.

Looking for you.

Your brother barely
danced with me
for five minutes--

Ok, just a minute.
Stand right...there.

Um, you're not
supposed to touch.

What is that?

It's a very important crystal.

Well, how did you know
that it was there?

Because I put it there.

When?
A long time ago.

Tonight, I'm taking it back,
thanks to you.

Well, what's it for?
Never you mind.

You can't just steal it.

It's not stealing
if it's mine.

Come on.
Well...

Vodka tonic.

Ok, I know that this
is probably going
to be strike 3,

But I hope
you can see it
for what it is.

And what is it?
Persistence.

Groveling, commitment.
Take your pick.

I fled town
because of you.

Fled.

I was young and stupid,

And then things changed.

Life got...real.

You'd know that better
than anyone.

Hypothetically speaking,
if allowed,

How would you
make things right?

Well, more groveling,
of course.

A recap of the past
few years spent
soul searching.

Cheese fries.

Obvious.

I know my audience.

Yes to lunch. Call me.

Look around.
What's missing?

The flames, the candles.

Why aren't they lit?

There's matches
in the kitchen.

Bitch.

Hey.

Hey.

So how are things
with Stefan?

Great. Just great.

Really?

Well, my radar
must be off,

'Cause I was
getting all sorts
of other vibes,

What is that?

Hmm?

Don't!

Oh god, Caroline,
what happened?

Nothing, ok?!

That is nothing.
Did somebody hurt you?

No, ok, nothing.

It just...

My mom would kill me.

Did Damon hurt you?

No! Of course not!

Just leave me alone,
ok, Elena?!

God!

There is something
seriously wrong with you.

You stay away
from Caroline or I will
go straight to her mother,

The sheriff. You got it?

Stay away from her.

I'm sorry.

I take it all back.

You're completely
right about Damon.

What did he do?

There are bruises

All over
Caroline's body.

Bite marks,
and he has her
all confused

And messed up
in the head.

You don't look
surprised.

Um...

I'm handling it.

Handling it?

Stefan, you should be
having him arrested.

Elena, please.

I...

I don't expect you
to understand.

I don't understand
anything, Stefan.

So why don't you just
clear it up for me?

Look, there are things
that you don't know, ok?

Things that I want
to tell you, but I can't.

And I may never
be able to.

And I just need you
to trust me.

Trust is earned.

I can't justagically
hand it over.

I'm so sorry.
I have to go.

You look amazing.
What are you doing here?

I was thinking maybe
I could make one more
wrong choice today.

I still have 17 minutes.

Don't!

She took it off and I
got flustered, ok?!

I didn't know
what to say.

But I swear, ok, I did
not tell her.

I just told her that you
didn't mean to hurt me.

You make me crazy,
you know that?

It's ok.
I forgive you.

I swear I didn't say--

Shh, shh, shh.

Unfortunately...

I am so over you now.

What the hell?

You know, I couldn't
spike your drink...

So I spiked hers.

Caroline?

There you are.

I've been looking
everywhere for you.

Are you ok?

Yeah. I'm fine.

Caroline,
what happened?

I'm fine.

No.

You're shaking.
Caroline--What--
I'm fine!

Caroline, come here,
come here.

I did
what I had to do...

To protect Elena,
to protect everyone.

Yes, Damon,
the headline reads

"Deadly beast captured.

All is well
in Mystic Falls."

Thank you
for staying so late.

Did you get
the gilbert watch?

She claims it's packed away
in her parents' things.

I can get it.

Good. We're going
to need it.

Are you sure?

5 bodies
all drained of blood?

I'm certain.

They've come back.

<i>previously on vampire diaries
for over a century, i have lived in secret until now..</i>

I know the risk,
but i have to know her.

Caroline: how come
you don't sparkle?

Because i live
in the real world,

Vampes bin sun.
you go in the sun.

I have a ring.
it protects me.

The pocket watch. where is it?

It's supposed to be mine.

Did you get the gilbert watch?

I can get it.

Good. we're gonna need it.

Caroline:
what is that?

A very important crystal.

You're the mystery guy
and i like that.

But with mystery
comes secrets.

I just need you
to trust me.

Trust is earned.

Oh, my god, caroline,
what happened?

Nothing
did damon hurt you?!

There are bruises all over caroline.

I'm handling it.

Zach: the vervain
could weaken him

If he ingested it.
it would help get you
the upper hand.

I knew i couldn't
spike your drink,

So i spiked hers.

Five bodies
all drained of blood?

They've come back.

Damon:
where is my ring?

Won't be
needing it anymore.

[groans]

How long
have i been here?

Three days.

What are you doin'?

During the dark ages
when a vampire's actions

Threatened to expose
or bring harm upon
the entire race,

They would face
judgment.

They sought to reeducate them

Rather than
to punish them.

You know what
will happen if i don't...

Feed on blood.

You'll grow weaker and weaker.

Eventually
you won't be able
to move or speak.

In a week your skin
will desiccate,

And you'll mummify.

A living corpse.

Unable to hurt anyone.

Ever.

So what, you're just going
to leave me in the basement,

Forever?

I've injected you
with enough vervain
to keep you weak.

Once your circulation stops,

I'll move you
to the family crypt,
and then in 50 years,

We can reevaluate.

[strained chuckle]
i'm stronger than you think.

You always have been.

But you're not sntronger
than the vervain.

And we both know it.

I'm sorry.

Didn't have
to be this way.

I--i'm sorry,
i'm almost done.

It's--it's ok.
take your time.

[music playing]

I think you might be
in trouble.

What did you do?

Oh, she saw me.

I'm a drug-using delinquent.

A girl in bed
doesn't really rank.

Sorry.

Elena: jenna!

Are you aware of what's
going on upstairs?

Uh-huh.

And you have no objection?

He could be
craftier about it,

At least make an effort
to sneak her in and out.

Oh, and just so you know,

I won't be home
for dinner.

Oh, so you're actually
going to do it.

You're gonna go out with logan.

I'm going to show up
and torture him, yes.

[chuckles]

And have you heard
from stefan?

Not sinceft that
very vague message
three days ago.

"hi, um, elena,

"i, um, have something
i have to do.

I'll, uh, explain
in a few days."

Haven't you called him?
nope.

Not going to, either.

And you're ok
with eeverything?

No, i'm not ok
with any of it.

But i'm not gonna
cry about it, either.

You , i was going
to write in my diary
this morning

And then i thought,
what am i going to write?

Honestly, i'm not
gonna be onee of those pathetic girls

Whose world stops spinning
because of some guy.

Ok, then.

I'll be fine.

He's awake.

He's weak,
but it's probably best

To stay out of the basement.

He's damon. i'm not sure
how dangerous

He still might be.
you're going to school?

Came here to live a life.

It's about time
i get back to that.

And elena,
if she's still
speaking to me.

Why haven't you
called her?

Am suppose to do,
feed her another lie?

I hate lying to her, zach.
i'm not good at it.

She already thinks
i'm hiding something.

What choice
do you have?

You came here because you wanted to live
as normal a life as you could.

You knew this was going
to be a part of it.

Caroline:
i remember the party.

Damon came up
behind me,

And he was kissing
my neck,

Or biting my neck.

I passed out.

It's like there's holes in my memory lately.

It's just weird.

Maybe i let him bite me.

Why would you do that?

Can we just not
talk about it, ok?

Donn't want
to talk about damon.

I don't want
to talk about

Any of it.

Just want to go
back to normal.

What are you doing
with that candle?

Um...

Nothing.

What's this?

Damon gave it to me.

Or he was going to give it to me.

All i know is,

It's mine now.

It's ugly.

Well, get your hands off it.

Roline: the sexy suds
car wash is tomorrow.

The football team
and the band have committed.

Well, not all the band.

Just the ones who could pull off the bikini.

I want, in your face, sexy.

I mean, it's a fund raiser, for god's sake.

Unbelievable.

It's like nothing
happened.

Lies and denial.

Hey.

Hey. you know, i gotta go.

Be somewhere right now.

I'm so sorry
i haven't called.

No worries.

I'll live.

I was dealing with damon.

And did you...
deal with damon?

Yes. yeah.

For four days?

You have every right to be upset with me.

But can i explain it all to you?
please.

Sure. when?

I gotta be home after school, but

The grill, on four o'clock?

Ok.
thanks.

Stefan, where is damon?

He has some serious apologizing to do.

He's gone, caroline.

When is he coming back?

He's not coming back.

I'm sorry.

This is a good
thing, caroline.

I know that.

[indistinct chatter]

Hey, matt, um,

Have you seen stefan?

Nope
[sighs]

If you want
to kill some time,

Um, you can rack.

[chuckles]
come on.

We haven't played
in forever.

I'll let you brick.

[damon coughing]

I'm full of vervain.

I've been putting it
in my coffee for 16 years.

My blood will only
make you worse.

Damon?

So it was your vervain.
good for you.

Good for you.

Family only runs so deep.

[coughing]

We're not family,
damon.

Only in the most
dysfunctional sense.

In fact, i avoided having
a living, breathing,

Loving family
because of you.

I don't guess
i could talk you into

Bringing me a rabbit
or something?

I'd settle
for stefan's diet
at this point.

You know
i can't do that.

You succeeded, zach.

I'm shutting down.

[breathing heavily]

You're like
your grandfather.

He didn't like it when
i came to visit, either.

But you don't
visit, damon.

You appear, unannounced,

Reminding me that
this isn't my house;

That you're just
permitting me to live here.

Hell, that you're
permitting me to live.

Someone had
to mow the lawn.

[scoffs]

I came to say
good-bye, damon.

Unlock it.

Unlock the door, zach.

[groaning]

[grunting]

[damon coughing]

Keep it up, damon.

The more energy
you expend,

The faster you'll go.

And there's vicki,
all nonchalant
in the bathroom

Like it's no big deal
that they're hooking up.

Yeah, i'm not gonna lie.

Your brother
and my sister,
that's weird.

Yeah.

How late is he?

Hitting
the hour mark.

Hope there's
nothing wrong.

Which means i'm not
talking boy problems
with you.

Good.

I mean, it's not
like we were ever

Best friends
or anything.

[scoffs]

Ok.

Here goes--

What do you
think of stefan?

Is he a good guy?

Why? what's he done?

Not any one thing.

He's just so secretive
all the time.

I think there's something
that he doesn't want me to know,

Which makes me
want to know
all the more.

Like what? like that
he's a serial killer

And he keeps
a clown suit
in his trunk?

[chuckles] no,
of course not.

But what do we know
about him, really?

He's great
at football.

A little bit
of a loner.

And as much as
i hate saying it,

He might be
a nice guy.

So you think
i'm just being paranoid?

I think you should
talk to him.

Stefan: talk to who?

I'm so sorry
that i'm late.

What happened?

I got held up.

Is everything ok?

There was this thing
with my uncle.

And you couldn't call
and tell me that you were
going to be an hour late?

Ok. you two
have fun.

I'm really sorry.

It was unavoidable.

What was unavoidable?

[chuckles] ok.

Oh, uh, elena,
please...

No, stefan,
don't you get it?

Every question
gets a vague non-answer.

What is so awful
that you're afraid
to tell me?

Man: i know you.

My god.

I'm sorry?
i know you.

How can it be?

I think you have
the wrong person, sir.

You haven't aged a day.

I'm sorry. excuse me.

Hey, can we--
can i take you home

And we can talk
about it?

Is that ok?

Wait, what was that?

I--i don't know.
uh, nothing.

Right, nothing.
ok, um...

I gotta go, stefan.

Excuse me.

Elena: i tried.

I want so much
to make things right,

But every instinct
in my body

Is telling me
to be careful.

What you don't know
can hurt you.

Evening, sheriff.

Anything?

We went over the entire
west side of the lake.

All the caverns
by the falls were clean,

No signs of habitat.

Well, they're
staying in town.

We canvassed all
abandoned buildings
and warehouses.

There has to be
a private residence.

And that much harder
to locate, if not impossible.

These creatures are smart.
they know how to go undetected.

Well, someone who only
comes out at night

Should eventually
become obvious.

What about the watch?
i'm working on it.

I knew the gilberts.

That watch is passed down

To the men in the family.
i'd start with jeremy.

I can't believe
you really came.

You have an hour.

Make it count.

Jeremy: you ok?

Is vicki in there?

Don't answer a question
with another question.

Maybe.

What's wrong with you?

I'm miserable.

Well, you should go
gesomething to eat.

[water running]

Jenna?

[water stops]
jenna?

Stefan?

What are you
doing here?

Dinner.

Jeremy told me
that chicken parmesan
is one of your favorites,

And i happen to be
a good cook.

The italian roots
demand it.

I can even make
my own homemade mozzarella.

Only tonight,
it is unfortunately
storboboht.

Sorry.

I don't know
what you're trying
to accomplish.

You want to know me, right?

Well, i figure
if you're going
to dump me,

You should at least,
um, know who you're dumping.

So let's start
with katherine.

Stefan...

She was...the most
beautiful girl that
i had ever met.

She had this perfect
olive skin.

And she had this laugh.

It was ridiculous.

I mean, her laugh
made you laugh.

And she was fun.

She knew how to have
a good time.

But katherine was also
very impatient and entitled

And selfish, and, um,
and impulsive.

Enter damon.

He claims that he was
with her first.

I don't know.

I do know
that i did some things

That...i'm not proud of.

And my biggest regret...

Is not being able
to make it right
before she died.

I miss her, but...

I'm no longer crippled
by her loss.

Vicki: it was very nice
what you did for stefan.

Very romantic.

Well, i was feeling romantic.

Look what i found.

"elena gilbert,

"take one tablet
every 4 to 6 hours,

As needed for pain."

Those are left over
from the car accident.

So she won't
miss them.

Nonot with that,
that's an antique.

[sighs]

I feel like
we're always
getting high.

That's the beauty
of choice.

Well, then let's
choose not to.

I mean, we don't have to be
high all the time, right?

I really hope you're
not one of those guys

Who, now that
we're together,

Tries to change
everything about me.

No.

Good.

[music playing]

I'm an avid reader,
a huge fitzgerald fan,

<i>the great gatsby,
his masterpiece.</i>

But i'm no snob.
i love some good grisham.

<i>i think seinfeld 
is the best american
television show</i>

For the past 50 years,

<i>but i love lucy
is all-time.</i>

"the loving cup" episode
was the best, i think.

Huge scorsese fan.

<i>i can watch taxi driver 
over and over again.</i>

Here, let me.

As far as music,
it's pretty much
across the board.

Um, dylan, hendrix,
patsy, willie.

Oh, kanye. you know
what, i even like
that one miley song.

[scoffs]
easy.

I didn't say anything.

Hey, this is for
the garlic bread, right?

Because i'm not eating garlic
unless you agree to, too.

Are you kidding?
i love garlic.

[chuckles]

Ow! ahh.

You ok?
um...

Yeah. think so.

[water running]

Your face...

I--i, uh,

I think i got
something in my eye.

Stefan.

Hey.

Stefan!

[exhales]

[chuckles]

Um, i think
that my paranoia

Has turned into
full-blown hallucinations.

Part of your charm.

[music playing]

Caroline.

Caroline.

No, tiki, do not do
the one-piece, ok?

I've seen it on you.
trust me.

Yeah, but you're going
for stripper pole
vibe this year.

Caroline.

[caroline giggles]

Yeah, maybe we should wash
the cars in slow motion.

[chuckles] no.

Caroline.

What? oh, um,
no, sorry.

Um, so i'll just
see you tomorrow.

Two-piece. ok, bye.

[bird caws]

Shoo, shoo!

Shoo!

[caws]

God!

[breathing heavily]

Damon: i bet you're
feeling pretty good

About yourself,
aren't you?

Not particularly.

You won.

You got the bad guy.

Now nothing could come
between you and elena.

Except the truth.

The lies will catch up
to you, stefan.

As long as you keep
lying to yourself
about what you are.

The beauty of you
in there

And me out here...

Is that i can walk away.

[music playing]

No friend discounts.

No freebies.

No pay ya laters.

We are not running
a charity here.

No, we are not.
hi.

Hey!

The event is called
sexy suds, you know.

[music playing]

Stefan: did we just
get scolded?

And judged, yeah.

Wow.
i'm sorry,
but i guess

You're going to have
to take that off.

I think you have
to go first.

Ok.

[music playing]

Ok, um--sorry,

So not sexy.

Ugh.

[chuckles]

I disagree.

Bonnie:
uh-uh, no.

None of that
tortured
pining stuff.

I'm just observing.

Mm-hmm.

Oh.

Tiki. this one's yours.

Why do i always get
the homely os?

Just to be clear,
your car's a p.o.s.

I mean, we can wash it,
but it's still a p.o.s.

You don't have to be rude.

Rude is uglying up
the road
with that junk.

[squealing]

Whoa!

[squealing]

Whoa!

Wet and wild, tik.

Logan: all proceeds are
going to the school's
athletic department

Still healing
from the tragic death

Of their football coach
william tanner.

The citizens
of mystic falls

Coming together
in support of one
of their own.

Cut it.

Jenna: classy.

Thank you.

But you're still going to

Video the girls
in bikinis, right?

We, 53% of americans
watch the news
with the sound off.

[chuckles]

Thank you for dinner.

I had a nice time.

Do you remember
the last time

We were in the school
parking lot?

Nope.

Doesn't ring a bell.

<i>really?
nada.</i>

Especially not having sex
in the minivan.

That was a good day.

What?
[laughs]

You're getting
soap in that.

Oh, it's fine.

I noticed at damon
has one, too.

Is there a story
behind it?

Yeah, it's the family crest
from the italian renaissance.

Hmm.

What's the stone?

It's called
lapus lazuli.

Oh.

You should really
take it off.

I could put it
in my bag.

No, it's--
it's fine, really.

Thanks, though.

Ok.

I'm gonna get some towels.

Ok.

Hey, we're out of towels
and those shimmy things.

I'll go get some more.
mind the money.

Damon: caroline.

Caroline, help me.

Caroline.

Help me.

Help me.

That'll be $20.

I saw you last night.

You were talking
to a friend of mine,

At the grill?

Well, i--i thought
it was somebody i knew.

Stefan salvatore.

Nah, it can't be.
it's just my mind

Playing tricks on me.

Where do you think
you'd seen him before?

When i first moved here,

I stayed
at the salvatore
boarding house.

Oh.

Stefan was just

Passing through
to visit his uncle.

I mean, none of us
knew he was even here

Until the attack.

The attack?

His uncle
got killed.

Mauled by an animal
in the woods.

His uncle, zach?

Mm-mmm. joseph.

I'm sorry, sir.

I don't think
i'm familiar
with the story.

Oh, how could you?

I mean,
this happened
years ago.

Grandpa, you gotta go.
mom wants you home.

Ok?

Ah.

He wasn't bugging
you, was he?

He's a little
alzy-heimer.

No, he was sweet.

Hey, sir,

I'm sorry. um,
are you sure

That the man that you saw,

That you knew, his name
was stefan salvatore?

Yes.

I remember his ring
and his brother--

Damon?
yeah.

Stefan and damon
salvatore.

When was this?

It was early june,

1953.

Yeah.

June, 1953.

Caroline finally
freed you, huh?

Uh, i don't know
where she went.

She abandoned me.

Hey, i realized earlier,
i had no idea

That your family
was from italy.

No?

Last name salvatore
didn't do it for you?

Right.

Duh.

Are there
any other salvatores
in mystic falls?

My uncle zach.

Where did
everyone else go?

Kinda just spread out.

Hmm.

Why?

I'm just trying
to learn more
about you.

Hmm.

Jeremy: where
are you taking me?

Vicki: we can't
hide out in your
room all the time.

[both chuckle]

Welcome to my other
favorite party place.

What, e cecemery?

Yeah.
it's cool, huh?

Boy:
yo, vick!

What's up, jared?

You baby-sitting,
donovan?

This is jeremy.
he's cool.

Smoke up.
[chuckles]

Your car was done
an hour ago.

You're saying that
out loud why?

Hi. elena, right?
i think i met you once

When you were 9.
oh.

Your emotional
maturity level when
we were together.

Ouch. here i thought
we were making progress.

Is he enough
in your good graces

That i can ask him
for a favor?

If i do her a favor,
will i get back in
your good graces?

Uh, a very reluctant
maybe to both.

Done. wait.
one condition.

Dinner, tonight,
your house.

Fine. but you're
eating leftovers.

Ooh.

[chuckles]
what do you need?

Do you have access
to old news stories,

Say, fifties?

Yeah, at the station.

Between the ariveses
and the internet,

We pretty much
have everything.

I have this report
way past due.

It'd be a life saver.

Heading there now.

Let's go.

If anyone asks,
you don't know where i went.

I don't want caroline
to know that i left.

Damon: caroline,
help me.

Caroline.

Help me.

Damon?

Damon?

Damon?

Oh, my god!

What is this?

How did i know
that you were here?

Because i wanted you to.

Very, very badly.

Let me out of here.

Please.

You bit me.

You liked it.

Remember?

Why do i keep remembering
the same things,

But in different ways?

You remember what
i want you to remember.

And now that
the vervain has passed
out of your system,

You won't remember
what you're about to do.

What am i
about to do?

You're gonna
open the door.

You're gonna
open the door.

Zach: no! no!

Get out of here.

Run!

Run!

[caroline grunting]

[screaming]

Sweeper duty.

What?

We have to clean
the pavement.

It's a car wash.

By definition,
the pavement's clean.

But not dry.

And i'm doing this why?

Caroline bailed,
so that leaves me in charge.

Fabulous.

[sighs]

[music playing]

[all yelling]

Bonnie!

Bonnie!

Bonnie!

Hey.

What just happened?

You were in some
kind of a trance.

Did i do this?

I think so, yes.

Nobody else saw,
did they?

Don't tell anybody.

Please.

[sirens]

Logan: we digitized
all our archives last year.

You can pull all the remote
footage right up on screen.

What is it exactly
you're looking for?

An incident
from 1953,

If it even happened--
[cell phone rings]

At the old salvatore
boarding house.

Sorry, one second.

Yeah?

All right, be right there.

I gotta go.

You believe there's
actual news to cover
in this town?

All right, use keywords
to search the database.

It's pretty easy
to navigate.

And brady down in tech
will help you out
with anything you need.

Ok.
all right?

Oh, hey.

Could you put in
a good word for me
with jenna?

You got it.

All right.
good luck.

[door closes]

[exhales]

What?

I'm stoned in a cemetery.

They don't mind,
they're dead.

Let me take this
up a notch.

Hey, tony.

Oh!

Nice.

Vickies from vicki.

Ha!

Well, thank you,
elena gilbert,

Whoever you are.

You took those
from the house?

She wa't u ung it.

She's gonna notice
if they're gone.
that's not cool.

It's no big deal, jer.

Yeah, it kinda is, vick.

Damn, dude.

Vicki brought
the party police.

Shut up, tony.

I'm sorry. i didn't
mean to make you mad.

Well, what are we doing,
partying in a cemetery

With a bunch of losers?
those are my friends.

They're waste of space
small-town lifers.

Yeah? what am i?

You're different, vick.

No, you are.

You're the kid
with the big house

Who's acting out
because his parents
died. guess what--

You'll get over it.

You will pull
yourself together,

Move on, and one day
tell your kids stories

About your dark period
growing up.

And i'll still be here,
waiting tables at the grill,

Partying
at the cemetery

With a bunch of waste of
space small-town lifers.

Look--
go home, jeremy.

If i want to feel like
crap about myself,

I'll just
go back to tyler.

[indistinct police radio]

Hey, have you seen
elena?

No, not for a while.

You think
she went home?

Not sure.
thanks.

Hey.

I'm not
saying this for you.

I'm saying it for her.

But she's big on trust.

So whatever you're
holding back from her,

The more you try to hide it,

The more she won't stop
till she figures it out.

This is michael fell

Reporting to you
from the salvatore
boarding house,

Where a brutal animal attack
has ended in tragedy.

Ok, they're bringing
out the bodies.

See if you can get closer.

Is that the nephew?

I didn't see you
at the car wash.

Left early.

Honey, are you ok?

Anything you want
to talk about?

Is it a boy thing?

Mom, if i want
to talk boys,
i'll call dad.

At least he's successfully
dating one.

[music playing]

Zach!

Oh, no, Zach...

Elena: dear diary,

I'm not a believer.

People are born,
they grow old,

And then they die.

That's the world we live in.

[music playing]

Elena: there's no magic,
no mysticism,

No immortality.

There's nothing
that defies
rational thought.

I don't know
what's happening to me.

I know, dear.

[music playing]

Logan?

Logan?

Elena: people are supposed
to be who they say they are.

And not lie or hide
their true selves.

What are you
doing here?

Oh, hey, man.
just looking
for the bathroom.

[music playing]

Elena: it's not possible.

I'm not a believer,
i can't be.

But how can i deny
what's right in front of me?

Someone who never
grows old...

Man: june, 1953.

Never gets hurt...

Oh, my god, your hand!

Is it deep?
how bad is it?

Someone who changes in ways
that can't be explained...

Hey, um, are you ok?

Your eye.

[music playing]

Your face.

Girls bitten...
what is that?

Oh, my god,
what happened to you?

It's nothing!
bodies drained of blood...

[gasps]

Did she say what
kind of animal it was?

She said it was a vampire.

[music playing]

Donovan?

No, i'm good.

[music playing]

[sighs]

Not it.
not it.

Not it.

Ah, vicki.

[laughter]

[music playing]

[damon coughing,
groaning]

Hey, man, you ok?

Come here.

Come here.

You don't look good.

Come closer.

I have something--
[coughs]

That i have to tell you.

[coughing]

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

I got you, i got you.

It's ok. it's ok.

[screaming]

[elena breathing heavily]

What are you?

Stefan: for over
a century, i have
lived in secret,

Until now.
i know the risk,
but i have to know her.

Damon: elena,
she's a dead ringer
for katherine.

Is that
"damon salvatore"?

And that's
"stefan salvatore."

The original
salvatore brothers.

1864, you and katherine
were the perfect couple.

They've come back.

Did you get
the gilbert watch?

I can get it.

Hey, man. you ok?
come here.

Whoa. whoa.
i got you.

Aah!

I know you.

I think you have
the wrong person.

You haven't aged a day.

There are things
that you don't know,

Things that i want
to tell you, but i can't.

Are you sure
that the man you knew,

His name was
stefan salvatore?

Yes.
when was this?

1953.

Dear diary,
i'm not a believer.

People are born.
they grow old.

Then they die.

That's the world we live in.

But how can i deny
what's right in front of me?

Someone who never grows old,

Never gets hurt.

Someone who changes in ways
that can't be explained.

Girls bitten.
somebody help!

Bodies drained of blood.

[horse walking]

[horse neighing]

Whoa.

You must be miss pierce.

Please,
call me katherine.

What are you?

What are you?

You know.

No, i don't.

Yes, you do,

Or you wouldn't be here.

It's not possible.

It can't be.

[sets down stake]

Everything you know...

And every belief that you have
is about to change.

Are you ready for that?

What are you?

I'm a vampire.

I shouldn't have come.

No.

No.

How did you do that?

Please don't
be afraid of me.

Let me go.
no.

Elena, there's things that you
have to know and understand.

Let me go!

Elena, please.

[muffled music playing
over headphones]

Elena.
[gasps]

I would never hurt you.

You're safe with me.

All those
animal attacks,

Those people
who died--

No. that was damon.

Damon?
yes.

I don't drink human blood.

That's not how i choose
to survive, but damon does.

I'll explain everything to you,
but i beg you, elena,

Do not tell anybody.

How can you ask me that?

Because you knowing this
is dangerous

For so many reasons.

You can hate me,

But i need you to trust me.

just go.

Just go, please.

Go.

If you mean me no harm,
then just go.

I never wanted this.

Mmm.

[grunts]

[speed dial]

Hello.

I want my ring.

Where are you?

I'm at the sizzler.

I had the buffet.

Where's my ring?

I don't have it.
where are you?
what have you done?

no, what have you done?

You're the one that
locked me in the basement
and starved me,

So whatever i've done,

Whoever i've sucked dry
is on you, buddy.

You're being careless.
how many more

Animal attacks
is this town
gonna believe, huh?

I know how to cover
my tracks, stefan.

Where's my ring?

I gave it
to zach to hide.

Probably shouldn't
have killed him.

Ah, you almost
got me.

Where is it?

I'll get it back,
but i need time.

What, did you fedex it
to rome? where is it?

I want my ring, stefan,

Or my next stop's
elena's.

I already want you dead.
don't give me another reason
to make it happen.

Don't give me another
reason to rip you apart.

Yeah? is that
gonna be before or after
you get your ring back?

Just get it.

[coughs]

You just don't
wanna die, do you?

You said you would
explain everything.

That's why i asked you
to meet me here.

When you google "vampire,"
you get a world of fiction.

What's the reality?

I can tell you
whatever you wanna know.

I know you eat garlic.
yes.

And somehow,
sunlight's not an issue.

Here's your drinks.

Thank you.

We have rings
that protect us.

Crucifixes?
decorative.

Holy water?
drinkable.

Mirrors?
myth.

You said you don't kill
to survive.

Animal blood
keeps me alive,

But not as strong
as damon. it can be
very powerful.

And yet you let him
get involved with caroline?

Forcing damon
not to do something

Is much more dangerous,
believe me.

He was hurting her.

He was feeding on her.
he was able

To take away
her memories
of being bitten

using a form
of mind compulsion.

She never knew what
was happening to her.

If he wanted
to kill her,
he would have.

Is that supposed
to make it ok?

no. no, none of this
is ok, elena.

I know that.

Are there any others,
aside from you and damon?

Not in mystic falls,
not anymore.

Not anymore?

There was a time
when this town was...

Very much aware
of vampires,

And it didn't end well
for anybody.

That's why it's
important that you
don'tell anyone.

I can't promise that.

Elena...

Give me today.

I will answer any
questions that you have,

And when it's over,

You can decide
for yourself

What you wanna do
with what you know.

It'll be your choice.

Never smelled one
this bad before.

It tried to cover
its tracks.

Are you sure?

I'm positive.
you only burn a corpse

To try to hide
cause of death,

And there are
no shell casings.

We know who they are?

Doc'll have to check
their dental records.

What story should i run?

Drug deal gone bad.

It's not too big a stretch.

I got the gilbert watch.

Good.

Found this in the brush
about 10 yards away.

Vicki donovan.

You know her?

I went to high school
with her mother.

Think she's
one of these?

I hope not.

Where are you, stefan?

I'm trapped at the house,

And i'm getting really bored
and really impatient,

and i don't do bored
and impatient.

Bring me my ring.

[music playing]

Damn it.

Aw, don't get blood
on the couch.

Please.

I got you good,
didn't i?

Well, you're not
gonna be any fun today.

I'm so gonna
regret this.

[gasping]

Drink up.

Drink it up.

Don't drip.

There you go. good girl.

That's it.

Stefan: stop here.

What are we doing here?

I want to show you something.

In the middle
of nowhere?

This...

Didn't used to be nowhere.

Used to be my home.

It looks so...

Old?

It's because
they are.

Wait. how long have you...

I've been 17 years old
since 1864.

Oh, my god.

You said
you wanted to know.

I'm not gonna
hold anything back.

Half century before
the boardinghouse
was even built,

This was
my family's home.

Damon and i...

We were both born here.

The salvatore brothers,
best of friends.

Raah!

Wait. where did you
learn this game?

Camp outside atlanta.

One of t officers
picked it up at harvard. catch.

Wait a minute.
wait a minute.

What are the rules?
what are the rules?

Who needs rules?

Mind if i join you?

Uh, well,
you could, uh--
you could get hurt.

My brother likes
to play rough.

Somehow, i think
that you play rougher.

[laughing]

Why are you
just standing there?

That is a girl
who clearly wants
to be chased.

If you don't do it,
i will.

You knew katherine
1864?

Damon made it
seem like--

Damon was trying
to make you think that...

I was still heartbroken.

He saw that i was happy
with you,

And he wanted to ruin it.

All because you
loved the same girl
145 years ago?

She wasn't
just any girl.

[katherine laughing]

Ha!

I win. what's my prize?

Damon: what would
you like it to be?

They extended
your leave?

I was simply
having too much fun

To return to battle.

Your commitment
to the confederacy
is inspiring.

Well, this works out
wonderfully for me.

How's that,
miss katherine?

Now i'll have both of you here
to keep me entertained.

First and foremost,

I'll need someone to escort me
to the founder's ball.

With pleasure.
i would be honored.

The smart and kind
salvatore brothers
both coming to my rescue.

How will i ever choose?

Stefan:
she chose me.

I escorted her
to the ball

At the original
lockwood mansion.

The first founder's party...

Where you signed
the registry.

I didn't care that
i had gotten something
that my brother wanted.

I didn't even care
if it hurt him.

I only knew
that i wanted her.

So he was upset.

That's the thing
about damon.

He doesn't get mad.

He just gets even.

Vicki: oh, man.

That shower was so great.

[music playing]

What did you give me?

Some blood.
you loved it.

I did?

Wait. i'm confused.

How did we get here?

Weetetn the woods.

You were drunk.
i attacked you.

Then i killed
all of your friends
and brought you here,

Gave you same blood.
you loved it.

And now we're
gonna party till
the sun goes down.

Ok.

Um, but first,
can i have another hit?

That blood was so good.

Only if i can.

Stefan:
what damon wants,
damon usually gets.

I didn't know it
at t time, but...

Turns out that night...

Katherine was
with him, too.

So he stole her from you,
not the other way around?

Turns out she
wasn't ours to steal.

I will love you forever.

Forever is a very long time,
you know.

Not long enough.

Good morning.

Clear the room, please.

You're upset.

Your face,

It was like a demon.

But you're
not afraid.

Get away from me.
get away.

It doesn't
change the way
you feel about me.

You will
not tell anyone.

I--
shh.

We will go on
exactly as we have.

Yes.

We will go on.

Heh heh.

You have no idea
of the future i have
planned for us, stefan--

You, me, and damon.

No rules.

Stefan: she could control
my mind and damon's.

She compelled each of us
to keep the secret
from the other.

She wanted all of us
to be together forever.

Didn't work out
that way, but...

Damon and i, looks like
we're stuck with each other...

Like it or not.

Is that damon's ring?

I took it from him,
but i have to give it back.

No. don't, stefan.
keep it hidden.

elena, if i don't
give it to him,

He'll retaliate in the only way
that he knows he can hurt me.

And how is that?

By hurting you.

[creak]

Doc i.d. the bodies?

A few townies.
notorious druggies.

I suppose that'll
make it easy for people
to buy the story.

And vicki donovan?

She's not one
of the deceased.

Where the hell is she?

I wish i knew.

Sorry i'm late.

You have the watch?

[clicks]

It's ready.

That's it?

Yes. that's it.

[music playing]

I am so over tyler,
so over him.

I knew from the beginning

That i was only
a piece of ass to him,

But i thought maybe
if he got to know me better,
he might see something more.

But no.

Now, jeremy,
on the other hand,

That's all he's ever seen in me
is something more,

And i like that.

Jeremy, huh?

Elena's brother?

Yeah. yeah.

So, elena used to date
my brother,

And they were
always together,

So jeremy would always
be hanging around

And crushing on me and--

Hey, why don't you
have a girlfriend?

You're, like,
totally cool
and so hot.

I know.

Don't you wanna be in love?

I've been in love.

It's painful and pointless
and overrated.

Except when it isn't.

No more talking.

Let's dance.

[sizzles]

[new song playing]

My mom spends
most of her time

In virginia beach
with pete.

He drives trucks.

I don't remember my dad,
bufrom what i gather,

He's not worth
remembering.

Your life is
so pathetic.

Yeah. i mean,
i'm the screwed-up one.

Matt's got it so easy.
he's the golden boy.

I mean, he's gonna get
a football scholarship

And marry elena
and have a lawn mower
and some babies,

and when
i think of my future,
i just come up blank.

You are so damaged.

Yep.

I mean, you don't have
one hint of self-esteem.

Nope, none.

I think i know
what can help you.

So what's that?

Death.

[snaps]

What happened?

We were dancing,
and then--

then i killed you.

[groans] what?

You're dead.
i'm dead?

Yeah, well,
let's not make
a big deal out of it.

Drank my blood,
i killed you,

And now you have
to feed in order
to complete the process.

[groans] you're wasted.

You don't wanna be
out there all alone.

You're about to get
really freaky.

ok, i had a really good time.

I just wanna go home.

You're gonna start
craving blood,

And until you get it,
you're gonna feel

very out of it.
you have to be careful.

Come on, move.

See? you're already
starting to fall apart.

And i'm going home now.

Ok, fine.
i'm just warning you.

Actually, you know what?

You should go.

In fact, if i were you,

I would stop by
your boyfriend jeremy's house.

Yeah, whatever.

Bye.
tell elena i said hi.

and if you see stefan,
tell him to call me.

[siren bloops]

[police dispatch chatter]

I got stanley
on the moore
street entrance.

The rest of us'll cover
other access points.

Call him or call me
if that thing goes off.

Don't use the radio.
cellphones only.

Got it.

You've got 8 rounds.

Remember,
wood bullets
won't kill him,

But it'll
wound him enough

For you to get close
and stake him.

You sure
you can handle this?

Of course i can.

You ever staked
a vampire before?

Have you?

[doorbell ringing]

Coming!

Hey.

The sun is killing me.
my eyes are on fire.

Where have you been?

It's good.
everything's good.

Did something happen?

I'm hungry.

What do you
got to eat?

You're high?

Vicki, it's the middle
of the day.

Could you just
not talk so loud?

My head, it hurts.

I need quiet.

E mind control...

You said katherine used.

Do you ever
do that to me?

No.

That necklace,

It contains an herb
called vervain.

it protects you
from being compelled.

I wanted to protect you
from damon's influence.

But i also wanted to...

Protect you from me.

All ght, n n you should
never take that necklace off...

Because no matter
what happens after today,

No matter
how you feel about me...

You'll know that you were
free to make your own choice.

Where is she?

Come this way.

What's she on?

---i d't know.

Hey, vic.
how you doin'?

Not good, mattie.

I hurt.

Ok, where's it hurt?

My gums. my jaw hurts.

My gum--there's
something in my gums,
and it hurts.

Ok, well--
no. just leave me alone.

Come on, vic.
don't be like that.
let's get you home.

Just turn it off!

Turn what off?

The talking,
the chatter,

Just turn it off.

[tv sound inaudible]

[volume increasing]
...horribly.

3 bodies were found dead
in what is believed to be

A drug deal gone awry.

The bodies have yet
to be identified.

They were discovered
earlier today

Over at the old
mystic falls cemetery.

That's where
we were last night.

What happened, vic?

...homicide, and are fast
under way looking for suspects.

They're asking anyone
with information...

I'm calling the cops.
no. don't.

What happened
after i left
last night, vick?

I'm fine. i'm fine.

Damn, vick.

Elena:
what's going on?

Matt: she's really
messed up.

Elena, back up.

Vicki, look at me.

Focus.

You're gonna be fine.

Everything's
gonna be fine.

Guys, take her
up to bed.

Shut the blinds.
she's gonna be ok.
come on.

Come on.

You know
what's wrong with her?

Yep.
what is it?

She's transitioning.

Transitioning to what?

A vampire.

What?

Damon must have gotten to her.
she's new.

She hasn't completed
her transformation yet.

H-how does she do that?

She has to feed
on human blood.

And what if
she doesn't?

She'll die.

She may only have
a few hours.

She's upstairs
with him right now.

It's ok.
she doesn't know what's
happening to her yet.

So when is
she gonna know?

Right now, she doesn't
remember anything.

A part of her
is still human,

But slowly,
the deeper she gets
into the transition,

the memories will start
to come back,

And then
she'll know she has
to make the choice.

The same choice you made?

I'm sorry
i'm so much trouble.

Aw, you just--you need
to sleep it off, ok?

No.

Vick.

Vick!

She was fine,
and then she just--
she just freaked out.

I'm gonna
go look for her.

Call me if you
hear anything.

I can track her.

Go.

[owl hoots]

[clicking]

[cellphone rings]

[ring]

Yeah.

I think i got something.

It's pointing towards
the old cemetery.

Headed your way.

Maybe we should
check in with matt.

He'll call
when he finds her.

Well, what are we
supposed to do?

We wait.
we're supposed to wait.

I don't know
what's wrong with her.

She'll be fine.

It'll all be fine.

[doorbell rings]

Jeremy, go upstairs.

You're afraid of me.

I'm gonna go out
on a limb here
and guess.

Stefan finally
fessed up.

Stay away from me.

Hey, there's no need
to be rude.

I'm just looking
for stefan.

May i come in?

Oh, wait.
of course i can.

I've been invited.

We can cut to the chase
if you want.

I'm not gonna kill you
right now.

That wouldn't serve
my greater agenda.

So...

Where's stefan?

He's out looking
for vicki.

Don't look at me
with those judgey
little eyes.

Girl's gonna thank me
for what i did to her.

Did you thank katherine?

Mmm.

Got the whole
life story, huh?

I got enough.

Oh, i doubt that.

Tell my brother
i'm looking for him.

Oh, tip for later.

Be careful who you
invite in the house.

Vicki.

I'm starting
to remember things--

What he is,
what he said.

I remember you.
the hospital,

The--the rooftop,
it's all coming back.

I'm so sorry.

Damon had no right
to do this to you.

He said that
i need to feed.

What will happen
if i don't?

You'll fade quickly...

And then it'll
all just be over.

I'll be dead.

Hey.

I don't want this.

I know. it'll be ok.

You're gonnae ok.

I can help you.

Is it better?

Is it better?

Will i be better?

I wanna go home.

Will you take me home?

Ok.

[gunshot]

[stefan groans]

Ahh!

No!

[groaning]

It's wood.

They know.

If anyone's gonna kill
you, it's gonna be me.

My ring.

No!

No! vicki!

I'm sorry.

Oops.

The watch.

Find the watch.

[music playing]

You're bleeding.

No, it's ok.
it's ok. i'm ok.

I couldn't stop her.

I tried.

What does that mean?

She fed,

And then i lost her.

Oh, my god.

I'll take care of it.

I'll find her,
and i will show her

That she can live
like i do.

I will make sure
that she does

Not hurt anybody, elena.
i promise you.

What do i tell
my brother and--
and matt?

We'll come up
with a story.

You mean we'll
come up with a lie.

I'm so sorry.

I gave you today
just like you asked.

And i understand that
you would never do
anything to hurt me,

And i promise i will
keep your secret, but...

I can't be with you,
stefan.

I'm sorry. i--

I just can't.
