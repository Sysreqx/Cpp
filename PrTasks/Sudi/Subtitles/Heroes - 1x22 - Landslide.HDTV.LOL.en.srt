00:00:01,362 --> 00:00:03,362
<i>Previously on</i> Heroes...

2
00:00:03,606 --> 00:00:04,751
This is a good bye.

3
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:08,441
I love you dad.

4
00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:10,526
I love you, Claire bear.

5
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:13,401
I care about the world.
I just want to heal it.

6
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:15,871
What could you
possibly know about healing?

7
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:17,833
A few things.

8
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:22,556
The company has devellopped
a new tracking system

9
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:25,943
that doesn't relly on isotopes
and satellites, it just finds you.

10
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:27,107
Wherever you are.

11
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,295
We go to New York,
we wipe out the Walker system.

12
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:30,938
There is someone you need to meet.

13
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:32,956
Molly Walker.

14
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:35,036
I hear you have an amazing ability.

15
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:37,647
They ask me where people are,
and I find them.

16
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:40,304
Molly is the only one
who can stop Sylar.

17
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:42,369
I must stop you.

18
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:43,731
Then, do it.

19
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:45,928
Do it!

20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,926
Kill me!
You can't.

21
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:49,471
Now, I'm gonna have to kill you.

22
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,335
Your destiny, Nathan,

23
00:00:54,662 --> 00:00:58,239
is to set the course of history
after this unspeakable act has occurred.

24
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,793
Can you be the one we need?

25
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:03,366
That's my boy.

26
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,159
I explode!

27
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:08,642
I wipe out this whole city.
You, Nathan, everyone.

28
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:10,135
You explode?

29
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,525
Like a nuclear bomb.

30
00:01:11,732 --> 00:01:15,112
If I lose it, you're the only one
who can get close enough to stop me.

31
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:17,910
Me, Ted...
it doesn't really matter.

32
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:19,407
But you have to do this.

33
00:01:21,743 --> 00:01:23,016
I just miss my family.

34
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,397
I hope I can make them proud.

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
Dad!

36
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,849
What's he doing?

37
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,529
He's absorbing your ability.

38
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:41,965
He's gotta make it stop.

39
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,247
Claire, you know what you have to do.

40
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,661
Do it.

41
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,222
Wait!

42
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:16,487
I'm okay.

43
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,912
Sword repair...

44
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:39,207
Yes. Do you fix ancient Samurai swords?

45
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:45,161
My name is Hiro Nakamura,

46
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:47,994
and the fate of the world
is in your hands.

47
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,692
So Peter Petrelli is your uncle.

48
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:53,521
You didn't know that?

49
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:55,671
There are a lot of things
they never told me.

50
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,204
I thought Peter was the only
person who could protect me.

51
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,168
Now you're here.

52
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:09,139
Why did you come here?
With them?

53
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:13,385
The people I used to work for
have a tracking system.

54
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,462
They can find anybody
anywhere in the world.

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,416
We came here to destroy it.

56
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:20,018
That's the only way
we can ever start over.

57
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:22,538
And build a normal life.

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,637
Is that even possible?

59
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,742
I mean, I'm not normal,
and they're not normal.

60
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:36,067
Everything that's been happening to us
has been so monumentally un-normal.

61
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:39,130
I mean, maybe Peter's right.

62
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:40,935
Maybe we all have a destiny.

63
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:43,742
And it's to save the world...
together.

64
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:46,944
I just rode 26 hours from Texas

65
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:49,047
to take down the evil bastards
who want me dead,

66
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:52,073
and you're saying I should go back
because of a painting that you saw?

67
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,528
That and a dream.

68
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:57,456
He might be nuts, but he's not lying.
He believes every word of it.

69
00:04:57,627 --> 00:04:59,084
They'll take out the tracking system,

70
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:00,697
- then you're gonna be free.
- Free?

71
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:02,915
I killed people with my powers, okay?

72
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:04,664
I didn't mean to, but it happened.

73
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:06,520
And now the FBI thinks I'm a terrorist.

74
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:08,023
But you're not a terrorist.

75
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:10,174
You need to get out of town
before you become one.

76
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:11,657
There's a town in Nebraska.

77
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:13,659
Windy Fork.
Population 15.

78
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:15,500
Go there and wait for me to contact you.

79
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:16,639
He gave me directions.

80
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,327
You're sending
your daughter with them?

81
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,861
Claire tells me she has a destiny.

82
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:22,869
She stopped Ted
from melting down once before

83
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:25,125
and saved all our lives...
she could do it again.

84
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,443
She could stop both of you.

85
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,313
You coming?

86
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:37,358
I'm in.

87
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:42,030
Me too.

88
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:51,758
Subtitles: swsub.com

89
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:08,891
We can do the photo op
outside the polls.

90
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,385
Yes, Marty... Marty!

91
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,489
I know we're still behind.
That's why every vote counts.

92
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:19,946
Exit polls have me five points down.

93
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:23,289
I never listen to polls.

94
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:25,891
Be ready, Nathan.

95
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,456
Today you will become
a congressman.

96
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:31,341
In time, you will lead the country.

97
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,832
As long as I let this city
become a nuclear wasteland.

98
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:42,455
And let my brother explode.

99
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,507
You can't stop that.
No one can.

100
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,132
But it's what comes next.

101
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:52,472
And that... that is entirely up to us.

102
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,442
Your father would be very proud.

103
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:04,442
Pop would have me committed
for even considering this nonsense.

104
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:07,167
Clearly, your mother didn't tell you.

105
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,333
Tell me what?

106
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:14,028
Your father was one of us,

107
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,892
someone with great power.

108
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:20,312
He tried to make
a difference in the world.

109
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:22,664
He did all he could,

110
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:24,326
and when that wasn't enough...

111
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:27,893
he just gave up.

112
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,851
Your father was weak.

113
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:41,865
My father was my hero.

114
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,042
And when I win...

115
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:49,730
I thought you were gonna see the boys
before they went to school.

116
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,383
They wanted to wish you good luck.

117
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:56,047
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were here.

118
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:58,356
That's all right.
I'm just on my way out.

119
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:05,357
Mrs. Petrelli, your husband
is about to become a very powerful man.

120
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,628
I would like to give you both a gift

121
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:13,335
to honor his forthcoming victory.

122
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:18,436
Something to make the days ahead

123
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:20,797
a little easier.

124
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,453
What is he talking about?

125
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,657
I don't know.

126
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:48,321
I can't believe you let
that man into our house.

127
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:52,564
Honey...
he's my largest campaign contributor.

128
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,175
He's a thief and a liar
and God knows what else.

129
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:58,284
And if I win this election,
he'll be the reason.

130
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:00,800
Why?
Because he gave you money?

131
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,695
Nathan, don't forget who you are.

132
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:04,225
I know exactly who I am.

133
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:09,471
I'm a man who's being asked to make
a hard choice for the greater good.

134
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,301
And you will.

135
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:13,131
And you're gonna do great things.

136
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,209
But you don't have to sell your soul!

137
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:19,465
What?

138
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,242
What is it?

139
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:22,654
Your foot.

140
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:26,372
It's moving.

141
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:28,181
What?

142
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:43,778
Oh, my God!

143
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:45,794
It's a miracle.

144
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,585
I've been thinking
after we save the world,

145
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:55,772
I might go on patrol.

146
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:57,599
You know, jumping in front of bullets

147
00:09:57,737 --> 00:09:59,878
and dragging people
out of burning buildings.

148
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:02,157
Not gonna catch me wearing a cape,

149
00:10:02,325 --> 00:10:04,861
zipping around with my underwear
outside my pants.

150
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:07,564
Why do we have to rent a car?
Can't we just fly to Nebraska?

151
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:08,761
In a plane.

152
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:10,646
FBI's got my face
all over wanted posters.

153
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:13,227
- I wouldn't get very far in an airport.
<i>- Ted's a fugitive.</i>

154
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:15,159
<i>I can use that to get his power.</i>

155
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:16,400
What is it?

156
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:17,713
It's Sylar.

157
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:19,434
He's here.
He's watching us.

158
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:20,661
Right now?

159
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:24,238
He knows what Ted can do.
We need to get off the streets.

160
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:27,053
Who's Sylar?

161
00:10:57,465 --> 00:10:59,569
Would have been nice
to have Heidi for the photo op.

162
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:01,200
Something happened back at the house.

163
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,113
- She all right?
- She's fine.

164
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:05,706
She's better than fine, actually.

165
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:11,009
We'll make an announcement
after the election.

166
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:12,222
What's going on?

167
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,404
Miracles, Marty.

168
00:11:17,884 --> 00:11:19,592
No, I need to speak to Nathan.

169
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,630
It's all right.
Mr. Hiro, how are you?

170
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:23,532
Fine.
Thank you very much.

171
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:26,522
We are trying to stop a bad thing.

172
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:30,949
The bomb.

173
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,919
Big boom.
You must help.

174
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:34,802
Or bad future will come.

175
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:37,375
Bad future?

176
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,174
Yes, we went there.
But I was already dead.

177
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:45,086
You become a... bad person,

178
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,681
But you can come with us now,

179
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:52,710
help us stop bomb...
together!

180
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:55,199
Sorry, Hiro.

181
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:57,347
I can't stop it.

182
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:02,886
Nobody can.

183
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:08,307
It's a pleasure to see you again.

184
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,434
Thanks for your support.

185
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:15,819
You already bad guy!

186
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:19,318
You are villain!

187
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:21,383
Villain!

188
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:23,571
Thank you all.

189
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,030
That's Petrelli?

190
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,281
Yep.

191
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:32,622
I don't see Micah.
Or Linderman.

192
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:36,351
We know they're in town.
Nathan can tell us where.

193
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:39,895
He'll never see us coming.

194
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:17,353
Mr. Claremont?

195
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:20,986
It's me. Hiro Nakamura.

196
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,737
I spoke to you on the phone.

197
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:25,806
About my problem.

198
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:37,306
My God.

199
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,127
The Kensei.

200
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:43,371
What happened?

201
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:45,121
It got cold.

202
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,106
Frozen.
Then... snap.

203
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:50,643
Can you fix it?

204
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,365
Depends.

205
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:56,086
On him.

206
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,550
I have a cousin who eats like you.

207
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:15,072
He's huge.

208
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:17,214
So am I.

209
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:20,528
You said you like comic books, so...

210
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:22,130
I bought you a stack.

211
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,396
Anything good?

212
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:29,456
The original Silver Surfer number one?

213
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,711
This must have cost you a fortune!

214
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,399
You're nice. Even when you're scary.

215
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:42,645
I just don't understand
why you're working for such a bad guy.

216
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,586
You could use your power to be a hero.

217
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:50,244
You're just too young to see
how much the world sucks.

218
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:53,404
How people can be
so mean to each other

219
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:57,283
just because of where they were born
or what they look like.

220
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,598
Mr. Linderman's gonna change all that.

221
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:09,597
He's gonna heal the world.

222
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,339
I didn't know it was sick.

223
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:21,929
- How are you?
- Good.

224
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,495
And how is our boy?

225
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,833
Good, sir.

226
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:28,035
I wanna see my mom.

227
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,071
After today, you can go home.

228
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,007
I don't believe you.

229
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:34,810
I'm sure other grownups
talk down to you, Micah.

230
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,741
I'm not gonna make that mistake.

231
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,569
I'm gonna look you
straight in the eye

232
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,092
and tell you one simple truth.

233
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:46,310
What you do here today

234
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,374
with your incredible ability

235
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,951
is going to save many lives.

236
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:59,213
What do you want me to do?

237
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:01,124
What comes naturally.

238
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:03,101
Talking to machines.

239
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,545
And after that,
you'll take me home?

240
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:08,210
I'll tell you what.
I'll do better than that.

241
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:09,866
You do as you're told,

242
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,424
and I'll make sure
that you and your parents

243
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,842
have enough money
to live happily ever after.

244
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:22,357
So this guy Sylar,
he kills people like us?

245
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,854
Yeah, to take what we can do.

246
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:25,043
How does he manage that?

247
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:26,547
He rips your head open.

248
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:29,177
I say we stick with the plan,
get out of the city.

249
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:34,164
Get out of here!
Go!

250
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,698
Federal agents. On your knees!

251
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:37,801
Now! Now!

252
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:41,228
Let's go!

253
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:44,247
There were two others!
Find them.

254
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,180
You're under arrest.

255
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,416
Agent Hanson?

256
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,894
I've been chasing you
all across the country, Ted.

257
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,532
You know I'm not a terrorist!

258
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:52,707
Do I?

259
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:55,164
You blew up a van full
of federal agents in Los Angeles.

260
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,744
But I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

261
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,524
Good. Your next stop...
Guantanamo Bay.

262
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:02,741
I'm gonna need
a concrete cell lined with lead.

263
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:04,251
So everyone is safe!

264
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:09,363
We got him,
thanks to your tip, Mister...

265
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:12,080
Mendez. Isaac Mendez.

266
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,650
I thought I recognized Sprague
from his picture in the post office.

267
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:17,019
I knew it was my duty to call.

268
00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:19,004
Especially with it being
election day and all.

269
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,421
You helped us capture
a very dangerous man.

270
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:23,774
Most people wouldn't take the risk.

271
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:25,672
I'm not most people.

272
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,115
A few things.

273
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:54,593
Welcome, Ms... Baker.

274
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:58,833
Do you mind if I take my son
into the voting booth with me?

275
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,288
I'm trying to teach him
about democracy in action.

276
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:02,960
What a lovely thought.

277
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:04,331
Follow me.

278
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:09,511
I've been thinking about
how you make yourself look like that.

279
00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:11,319
You must bend light or something.

280
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:14,235
How do you know this isn't the real me?

281
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,855
Okay, Micah,
it's time to boot up.

282
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,722
What do you want me to do?

283
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:29,273
You can tell computers what to do.

284
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:32,729
So I want you to tell this one
and all the others here

285
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:34,508
to vote for Nathan Petrelli.

286
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,956
After this, we do the same thing
in 12 other precincts.

287
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:46,823
We don't have to go anywhere else.

288
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:48,540
It says that they're all networked.

289
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,889
So from here, I can change
every one in the city.

290
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:52,827
It says that?

291
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:55,915
How many votes does your boss
want him to win by?

292
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:58,003
Make it a landslide.

293
00:22:14,662 --> 00:22:15,828
Can I go home now?

294
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,084
Sorry to interrupt your big day.

295
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:36,073
How did...

296
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:40,006
I didn't think I'd be seeing you again.

297
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,017
I thought after you
tipped me off about Linderman,

298
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:45,600
I figured you'd be dead.

299
00:22:45,903 --> 00:22:48,379
And Niki thought
that you were gonna take him out.

300
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:49,976
Let me guess.

301
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:52,130
He made you an offer
that you couldn't refuse.

302
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:54,023
Something like that, yeah.

303
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,630
We came here to find Linderman.

304
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:57,377
- Who are you?
- He took our son.

305
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:00,028
Why would he do that?

306
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:02,077
Something to do with you
and the election.

307
00:23:02,285 --> 00:23:03,330
Kidnapping.

308
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:05,636
That's a serious accusation.

309
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:08,176
I hope you have evidence.

310
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:09,622
Cut the crap, Nathan.

311
00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:13,056
We both know that you hate
Linderman as much as we do.

312
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:14,789
You were gonna kill him.

313
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:17,733
Let us finish the job.

314
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,532
Whatever you think
you're getting from this man,

315
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,743
he's gonna take back
ten times more from you.

316
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:26,114
And he ain't never gonna stop
until everything you care about is gone.

317
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:44,216
If I tell you where Linderman is...

318
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:48,191
I have to know
that he's not gonna come after us.

319
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,844
The man took my son.

320
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:54,058
He's gonna pay for that in full.

321
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:26,561
<i>Takezo Kensei longed to unite Japan.</i>

322
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,171
<i>He went to the dragon
of Kiso Mountain</i>

323
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:36,879
<i>and asked the dragon
to teach him the secrets of the sword.</i>

324
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:40,232
<i>The dragon taught him
to become the Kensei,</i>

325
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:42,512
<i>the sword saint.</i>

326
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:48,704
<i>He fought his enemies and won,
saving his people.</i>

327
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,662
<i>Then the dragon came to his palace,</i>

328
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:54,465
<i>demanding the life of the princess.</i>

329
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:57,009
<i>Kensei drew his sword</i>

330
00:24:57,761 --> 00:24:59,794
<i>and plunged it into his own heart.</i>

331
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,407
<i>He handed it to the dragon and said,</i>

332
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:07,240
<i>"My love is in here. Take it. "</i>

333
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:09,520
<i>And then he died.</i>

334
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:44,660
Tracking system's on the 42nd floor.
Get a read on someone.

335
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:49,269
You sure there isn't another way?

336
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:51,549
The reason I brought you here, Parkman,

337
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:54,730
was so that you could get us to those
elevators without raising a ruckus.

338
00:25:54,873 --> 00:25:56,932
If you can't do that,
you might as well give up

339
00:25:57,062 --> 00:25:58,703
on your wife and unborn child right now.

340
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,681
Because no matter how far you run...

341
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,365
they will find you.

342
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,489
A simple "no" would have done the trick.

343
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,503
- Good morning, Stanley.
- Okay, I got it.

344
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:11,754
Stanley, hey, man.

345
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:13,325
I just took my buddy to lunch,

346
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,128
I forgot my ID.
Can you buzz us through?

347
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:16,286
I don't know you.

348
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:18,227
It's Matt from accounting on 3-6.

349
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:20,993
What are you talking about?
We just went to Ray's for an egg parm.

350
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:22,661
I'm gonna need to see your ID, buddy.

351
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:25,554
Stan, come on, buddy,
you don't remember?

352
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:28,408
Remember on the weekend,
I ran into you at the...

353
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,162
At that restaurant.

354
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:32,893
<i>Where did I take Tanya, Shopsins?</i>

355
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,115
Shopsins.

356
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:36,186
Right? You introduced me to Tanya.

357
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:40,053
<i>I did? Drank and, God,
I hope I didn't...</i>

358
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:41,536
You okay, Stan?

359
00:26:42,914 --> 00:26:44,390
Remember? You were really drunk.

360
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:47,072
And you were worried about
people finding out about the...

361
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,306
you know...

362
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:53,957
the porno.

363
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,005
Yeah, don't worry about it! Here.

364
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:58,908
You guys go ahead. Have a good day.

365
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,788
- Thanks, Stan.
- No problem, sir.

366
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,846
The password doesn't work.
They changed the protocol.

367
00:27:12,161 --> 00:27:14,668
We have to wait until
you can pick it out of somebody's head.

368
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:17,566
We gotta move. Right now.

369
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:24,376
That blonde works for Linderman.
Let's go.

370
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:27,246
Linderman could be on any floor.

371
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,684
Then we'll search them all. Come on.

372
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,049
Mr. Hawkins. Ms. Sanders?

373
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:40,662
Relax.

374
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:42,982
My friend can hear your thoughts.

375
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,578
He says we have similar goals.

376
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,775
Didn't I throw you out a window?

377
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,800
You're responding well to the treatment.

378
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,457
The important question is

379
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:26,518
how are you feeling, Molly?

380
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,570
Good, I guess.

381
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:31,012
As long as I don't get any more shots.

382
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:35,380
The antibodies in my blood
are a cure for the virus.

383
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:37,700
I'm afraid we will need
to continue the treatments.

384
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:38,823
I'm all better.

385
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,469
Look what I can do.

386
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,007
Just like before I was sick.

387
00:28:48,222 --> 00:28:49,588
I think about someone,

388
00:28:49,726 --> 00:28:51,624
and I know where they are in my head.

389
00:28:55,497 --> 00:28:56,508
Right...

390
00:28:56,755 --> 00:28:57,817
here.

391
00:29:01,228 --> 00:29:04,151
How do I know you're not playing a trick
just to get out of more shots?

392
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,779
Now, you've put that pin
in this building.

393
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,057
Is that supposed to be me?

394
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:13,228
No. It's my other hero.

395
00:29:13,743 --> 00:29:15,384
If he's here, can I see him?

396
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:16,684
Your other hero?

397
00:29:16,942 --> 00:29:17,942
The police officer

398
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,281
that saved me from the bogeyman.

399
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:30,692
If your power has returned,

400
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:33,151
we can stop the bogeyman

401
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:35,147
so he never hurts anyone else.

402
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:37,971
Can you think about it?

403
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:39,743
Show me where he is?

404
00:29:41,132 --> 00:29:42,465
You sure you wanna know?

405
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,762
And how's our favorite
patient, Dr. Suresh?

406
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,342
Much improved.
Molly says she can locate Sylar.

407
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:52,968
We should go after him immediately.

408
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,340
We will, soon.

409
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:57,000
Right now, you need
to go away with Molly.

410
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,474
We have a helicopter on its way
to take you both to a safe location.

411
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:08,198
You'll find Linderman on 51.

412
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,161
Good luck finding your son.

413
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:16,287
Right. Nice to see you too.

414
00:30:16,754 --> 00:30:18,442
How do we take out this tracking system?

415
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:20,377
Erase a hard disk,
destroy a satellite link?

416
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:22,235
You did your part. This is mine.

417
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,991
Surveillance picked 'em up
in the elevator.

418
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,374
What does he want?

419
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:36,123
Molly.

420
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:49,156
<i>Good night, Bennet.</i>

421
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:55,744
It was Thompson.

422
00:30:56,307 --> 00:30:57,457
I heard him waiting for you.

423
00:30:57,609 --> 00:30:59,216
- Anybody else?
- No. He's alone.

424
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:00,855
All right, stay here!

425
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:02,812
What? No! I don't have a gun!

426
00:31:13,044 --> 00:31:14,821
What am I thinking now, Parkman?

427
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,441
Your last thought.

428
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:24,315
How'd you know he was gonna
come up on me?

429
00:31:25,606 --> 00:31:26,717
We were old friends.

430
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,038
I thought I heard a noise.

431
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:36,110
It's nothing.
Go back to your room, okay?

432
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:37,231
Good girl.

433
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,959
Look, whatever happens in here,
you gotta know

434
00:31:47,191 --> 00:31:49,750
this is the only way our
families are ever gonna be safe.

435
00:31:50,003 --> 00:31:51,194
Why? What do you mean?

436
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:52,787
What's here?

437
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:55,166
Where's the tracking system?

438
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:57,169
It's in there.

439
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:09,753
That's the tracking system?

440
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,411
A kid?
We came here to kill a little girl?

441
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:14,066
No.

442
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:16,715
I knew it was a person,
but I had no idea.

443
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,483
Lower your gun.

444
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,177
As long as she's alive,
my daughter will never be safe.

445
00:32:25,303 --> 00:32:26,402
None of them will.

446
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,613
Lower your gun, or I will kill you.

447
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:31,656
Shoot me, and she dies.

448
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:19,283
I'm hurt!

449
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,935
I think it's bad!

450
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:24,819
Here, let me help.

451
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,186
Where is my friend?

452
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:17,149
He bought one of my Nagamakis and left.

453
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:19,544
He bought a sword?

454
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:23,166
He said if you weren't
going to save the world, he would.

455
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:45,297
Hey, move the car!

456
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:47,939
Come on, get moving!

457
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:51,120
- Is this the only way out of the city?
- No, but it's the fastest.

458
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:25,903
This is the sickest thing
I've ever seen.

459
00:35:26,772 --> 00:35:28,340
Did this happen in the accident?

460
00:35:28,785 --> 00:35:30,549
The top of the guy's head came off!

461
00:35:30,907 --> 00:35:32,362
How else does that happen?

462
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:33,981
You don't wanna know.

463
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:41,798
Sylar got him.

464
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,942
He killed Ted.

465
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,862
Does that mean Sylar
can do what Ted can do?

466
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:48,736
He's the one.

467
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:52,422
He's gonna wipe out the entire city.

468
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:56,117
You've gotta stop him.

469
00:35:56,484 --> 00:35:57,986
I don't think I can.

470
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:01,030
The last time I fought Sylar,
he killed me.

471
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:04,734
Come on. Come on.

472
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:11,963
Yes, we'll send a helicopter
to retrieve the Petrelli family.

473
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,894
Just make sure they're not late.

474
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:27,335
I must admit,
I'm quite surprised to see you here.

475
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:29,422
Where's Micah?

476
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,740
She asked you a question.

477
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,156
You wouldn't even have Micah
if it wasn't for me...

478
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:41,747
arranging your relationship.

479
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:45,674
Crafting your opportunities.

480
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:48,717
What gives you the right
to ruin our lives,

481
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,862
take our boy from his home,
your money?

482
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:53,071
You think being rich
makes you better than us?

483
00:36:53,351 --> 00:36:55,923
Well, social Darwinism
did play its part.

484
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:59,043
I believe destiny to be intrinsic.

485
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:00,608
Your destiny...

486
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:03,679
is to give me back my son.

487
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:05,352
He's in the building.

488
00:37:06,038 --> 00:37:07,111
42nd floor.

489
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:09,529
I'll go look for Micah.

490
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:12,048
Watch him.

491
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:13,887
You'll never see him again, you know.

492
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:16,351
How's that?

493
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,357
Jessica's gonna kill you for me.

494
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:25,859
Open the bag.

495
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:33,018
You just caught me preparing for a trip.

496
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:35,547
Yes.

497
00:37:42,547 --> 00:37:45,622
Well, consider this a deposit
with more to follow.

498
00:37:46,105 --> 00:37:47,147
How much more?

499
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:49,438
- You can't be listening to this!
- Of course she is.

500
00:37:49,605 --> 00:37:52,319
Like most women whose lives
have been ruined by men,

501
00:37:52,516 --> 00:37:55,958
all Jessica really wants is security,
and money buys that.

502
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:58,339
Money's all she's ever
really cared about.

503
00:37:58,502 --> 00:37:59,864
She cares about our son.

504
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,610
How much?

505
00:38:02,737 --> 00:38:04,130
5, 10 million?

506
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:05,796
Think about Micah.

507
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:08,292
You saw that painting.
You came here to save him.

508
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:09,475
Alright.

509
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:13,241
$20 million to kill your husband

510
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:15,047
and walk away.

511
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:22,110
He's right, D.L.

512
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:27,185
I wanna take the money.

513
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:29,858
I really do.

514
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:34,284
I would even kill you for it.

515
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:40,433
But Niki wouldn't.

516
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:54,957
You don't love him.

517
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:57,229
Everything I've done...

518
00:38:57,988 --> 00:38:59,010
I did for them.

519
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:10,019
You should have taken the money.

520
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:28,927
I don't care what he said.

521
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:31,046
Me and you getting together...

522
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:33,505
that was real.

523
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:37,797
Jessica wasn't the strong one.

524
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:40,508
It was you.

525
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:53,924
Baby...

526
00:40:00,605 --> 00:40:02,286
I feel so stupid sitting here.

527
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,952
I wanna jump out of this damn chair.

528
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:08,556
People don't believe in miracles.

529
00:40:09,444 --> 00:40:11,476
When the time is right,
we'll tell everyone.

530
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:13,999
We're ready.

531
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:42,404
Thank you all.

532
00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:44,951
Thank you very much
for your amazing support.

533
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:48,658
A landslide.
That's what they're calling it.

534
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,958
I'm sorry my brother
couldn't be with us tonight.

535
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:58,321
But I know that Peter cares
about this city more than anyone.

536
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:00,350
You know, our father always said

537
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:02,008
that we had a responsibility

538
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:03,926
to use what God gave us

539
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:06,261
to help people.

540
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:08,660
<i>To make a real difference.</i>

541
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:14,578
<i>Pop always made the hard choices
for the greater good.</i>

542
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,774
He believed in that.

543
00:41:17,323 --> 00:41:18,331
And so do I.

544
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:20,577
Our children deserve that.

545
00:41:21,008 --> 00:41:22,520
They deserve a better future.

546
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,486
A future where they don't have
to face their fears alone...

547
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,945
but can look into the darkness
and find hope.

548
00:41:32,644 --> 00:41:35,863
I challenge everyone in here
to inspire by example.

549
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,750
To fight the battle,
no matter the cost.

550
00:41:41,424 --> 00:41:43,013
Because the world is sick

551
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:46,088
and spinning out of control.

552
00:41:47,717 --> 00:41:48,944
But we can help.

553
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:52,132
With our help, it can heal.

554
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:56,016
With our love, with our compassion,

555
00:41:56,676 --> 00:41:57,775
and with our strength

556
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,780
we can heal it.

557
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,416
Let's put aside our differences.

558
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,105
Let's embrace our common goals.

559
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:06,571
Let's do it for our children.

560
00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:10,707
Let's show them all exactly
what we're capable of.

561
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:13,156
Thank you all.

562
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:15,454
Thank you very much.
