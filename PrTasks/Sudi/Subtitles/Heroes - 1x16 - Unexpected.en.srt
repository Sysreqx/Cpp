1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:04,838
Somewhere in the Nevada Desert.

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,675
Hi, Ted.

3
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,520
No internet
connection available.

4
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,397
Ted... I know you're there.

5
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:35,118
I'm not online.
How are you doing this?

6
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,496
I know what they did to you.

7
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,584
Look at the needle.

8
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,427
We should meet.

9
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:55,889
Turn around.

10
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,390
My name is Hana Gitelman.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,316
How the hell did you do that?

12
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:06,738
Satellite signals.
Wi-Fi, radio waves.

13
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,313
Your computer can download
them and so can I.

14
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:10,982
So you can, uh,

15
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:13,530
access the internet
without a computer.

16
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:15,031
Just pull email
out of your head.

17
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:17,413
Yes.

18
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,663
And you're radioactive.

19
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:23,040
Why come to me?

20
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:26,872
Because they got to me too.

21
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:33,513
I can find them, Ted.

22
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:35,301
And you can nuke them.

23
00:01:36,436 --> 00:01:38,301
Previously on Heroes.

24
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:41,103
Turned on the waterworks,
and they were mine.

25
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:44,851
- They're getting the suitcase as we speak.
- Where's the bag?

26
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:48,062
You may fool Ando,
but you do not fool me.

27
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:51,523
Matt Parkman,
here to protect you, sir.

28
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:54,651
Sir, we've got to get out of
here right now. This is a setup.

29
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:56,500
- What? How do you know that?
- I just do.

30
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:58,580
Now, you absorb all
these abilities you find.

31
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,950
I'm gonna teach you how to
pull 'em out one at a time.

32
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:03,791
- I don't have to do anything!
- Except fly.

33
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,420
- Hello. Zane Taylor?
- Yes.

34
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:14,672
You must be Dr.
Suresh. Come on in.

35
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,843
There are others
out there like you.

36
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,390
- And I am going to find them.
- I could go with you.

37
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,512
She had an appointment
with a neurologist.

38
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:24,440
Your mother's been
having some headaches.

39
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:26,563
Yeah, she's also been
having some memory loss.

40
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:28,230
Did you tell them that?

41
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:31,150
I don't know any Mr. Muggles.

42
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,611
And I don't know you.

43
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,032
Dad?

44
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:41,742
Dad!

45
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:45,622
Dad?

46
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:47,660
Where's Dad?

47
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,473
He's on one of his
stupid business trips.

48
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:50,830
There's something
wrong with Mom.

49
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,422
There's something
wrong with you.

50
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,170
Mom?

51
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:57,841
Do you know who this is?

52
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,721
Claire, leave your
brother alone.

53
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,300
You recognize us?

54
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:07,020
Yes, you are the daughter who is
supposed to be setting the dinner table.

55
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:09,310
I was standing right
there just a minute ago,

56
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,483
and you had no idea who I was.

57
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:15,482
Lyle, help your sister with the table.
Honestly, Claire.

58
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:19,192
Good thing Dad's not home,
'cause he would so drug test you.

59
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,622
It's good you called us, Isaac.

60
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,673
I didn't know who
else to trust.

61
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,592
That man, Peter Petrelli,

62
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:38,460
is going to be
responsible for all this.

63
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:43,180
I tried finding him. I kept painting
what I thought were empty spaces.

64
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:46,141
- And now?
- There, in the water.

65
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,312
Footprints.

66
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:50,563
So...

67
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:53,102
Peter's invisible?

68
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:56,193
That sound so crazy?

69
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:58,573
Any more than a man who
can paint the future?

70
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:00,902
Peter absorbs
others' abilities.

71
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:04,280
Apparently, he's met someone
who we assumed was dead.

72
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,042
- That's the roof of the...
- The Deveaux building.

73
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,082
Look, there's a chance that
Peter might come here first

74
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,173
before we reach him.

75
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:27,600
What do you expect
me to do with this?

76
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:31,732
Save the world.

77
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,122
Chapter Sixteen - Unexpected

78
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:12,103
Hey.

79
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,231
Hey.

80
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:14,730
You know what? Let me do that.

81
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:17,062
I am pregnant, not porcelain.

82
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:18,942
No, I'm just trying
to be Mr. Helpful.

83
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:21,020
Try Mr.
Get-the-hell out-of-the-way.

84
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:35,120
What did you do?

85
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,590
You like it?

86
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:42,880
I love it.

87
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,633
- I do.
- Yeah?

88
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:48,642
Matt, we can't afford this.
I mean, we're...

89
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:50,600
Nah, come on. I got a guy.

90
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,352
He gave it to me
wholesale, so...

91
00:05:58,065 --> 00:05:59,863
I'm so bloated.

92
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:02,401
You, you look so
beautiful to me.

93
00:06:05,035 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,532
You...

95
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:11,620
made this beautiful gesture,
and I have to mess it up.

96
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:13,413
What do you mean? 

97
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,123
A man called yesterday.

98
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,793
A Professor Suresh.

99
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:20,581
He was a geneticist.

100
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,921
He wanted to talk about DNA.

101
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,343
Matt, your DNA.

102
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:30,093
Did you tell him anything?

103
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:31,572
I mean, you didn't tell him anything,
did you?

104
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:33,430
Of  course I didn't
tell him anything.

105
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,350
He found you.

106
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:37,022
He  knows.

107
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,020
Geneticists.

108
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:41,902
Who are these people?

109
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:59,752
Um, before we go in,
I just wanted to say thanks.

110
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:01,122
For what?

111
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,170
Well, you know,
for bringing me with you.

112
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:04,672
You  didn't have to do that.

113
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:06,273
It would have been
a long road alone.

114
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:07,420
I'm glad for the company.

115
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:10,011
Well, I believe in fate,
Mohinder, and karma,

116
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:12,643
and I'm not just saying
that 'cause you're Indian.

117
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,283
I mean,
you really came to my rescue,

118
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:15,930
and I won't forget that.

119
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,731
It's not completely
altruistic on my part, Zane.

120
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:20,162
I have a feeling
we're gonna meet up

121
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:22,152
with a lot of skepticism
from these people.

122
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:23,862
- You can help.
- I'm ready.

123
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:27,363
Excuse me!

124
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,452
Excuse me.

125
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,333
Oh.

126
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:40,710
Rap music.

127
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:44,543
Can't stand it, but it's the only thing
I've found that cancels out the...

128
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:48,923
- Can I help you?
- We're looking for Dale Smither.

129
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:50,170
You found her.

130
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,683
Oh. O-of course.

131
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:55,471
I'm Mohinder Suresh,
and this is Mr. Taylor.

132
00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:57,760
Zane. Actually, it's just Zane.

133
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,811
I left you several
messages this week.

134
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:01,353
Yeah, I got 'em.

135
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:03,943
I believe I can help with
what's happening to you.

136
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,560
I'm sure you have
lots of questions.

137
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:07,152
Yeah, only one...

138
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:10,441
- How'd you find me?
- You gave blood 11 years ago.

139
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,490
Signed a consent form
to have a sample used

140
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,570
in a program called the
Human Genome Project.

141
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:16,783
You dialed the wrong number.

142
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:20,080
Look, I know what you're
thinking right now,

143
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:21,830
that you've got
nobody to talk to,

144
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,046
nobody that understands
what you're going through.

145
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:27,388
But that's not true.
I-I understand.

146
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:30,303
Yeah?

147
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:50,362
Damn.

148
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:54,453
That was my best wrench.

149
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,533
So there really
are others, huh?

150
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,830
Yes. I'm proof of that.

151
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:03,331
That's why we're here.

152
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,333
I-I...

153
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:09,920
I thought the headaches at
first were gonna kill me.

154
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,382
I'd lie awake at night thinking
that my head was gonna explode.

155
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:16,891
A cockroach crawling
across my neighbor's floor

156
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:20,653
was like a marching band
parading through my house.

157
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,891
I'm sorry.
It must be quite a burden.

158
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:24,350
A burden?

159
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:27,150
Hell, no.

160
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:29,860
This is the best damn thing
that ever happened to me.

161
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,690
Well, now that I've
learned to control it,

162
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:34,070
I'm like Superman or something.

163
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:36,610
I can hear rain coming
from 40 miles away.

164
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:39,321
I can even hear
someone's moods...

165
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:43,453
The tiniest changes
in a heartbeat.

166
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,120
Yours, for instance.

167
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,460
It's racing kind of fast.

168
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:53,210
You nervous about something?

169
00:09:54,558 --> 00:10:00,010
Um, no, I'm just excited
to meet somebody like me.

170
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:04,522
Well, if you've come to try
to take it away from me,

171
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,600
you're gonna have a hell
of a fight on your hands.

172
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,231
I can assure you we
only want to help.

173
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:09,941
Uh, I'd like to
perform a few tests,

174
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,980
s-some questions,
really, that's all.

175
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:13,943
Shouldn't take more
than a couple of hours.

176
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:16,073
I'm kinda backed up today.

177
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,781
We can come back
in the morning.

178
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,660
Okay.

179
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,252
One.

180
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:31,541
Two.

181
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:32,592
Three.

182
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,803
Ando?

183
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:47,390
Is that you? I'm locked in!

184
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,733
You're not Ando.

185
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,480
S.R. Gustavson.

186
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,190
State Gaming Commission.

187
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:59,613
I come in peace.

188
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:05,453
- What's an Ando?
- Ando is my friend.

189
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:07,911
I bring him from
Japan on my mission.

190
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:09,790
- Where's the girl?
- Oh!

191
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:11,671
Where's the suitcase?

192
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:15,131
She said her name Hope.

193
00:11:15,178 --> 00:11:16,710
Tell me where they are!

194
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:20,382
Take me with you.
I must save Ando.

195
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:22,973
Not a chance.
I work alone, pal.

196
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:28,892
You take me with you
or she gets away...

197
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:30,603
pal.

198
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,192
I so miss you, Karen.

199
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:39,862
I miss your laugh.

200
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,492
But they're gonna pay
for what they did to me.

201
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,581
What they did to us.

202
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:52,293
I know you're not gonna
like what I gotta do.

203
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:59,553
So, uh, I came to say good-bye.

204
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:28,700
- Enough!
- I say when it's enough!

205
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:31,153
You've got a power to stop me.
What are you waiting for?

206
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,382
I'm trying!

207
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,672
And when you've left New
York a smoking wasteland,

208
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,471
we'll put that on
your tombstone:

209
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:46,011
"Here lies Peter Petrelli.
He tried."

210
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:49,810
Dig into that file cabinet of
yours and pull something out!

211
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:52,563
Fly, stop time,
paint me a pretty picture.

212
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:56,360
Do... something... unexpected!

213
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,363
Ha ha!

214
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,573
You pushed that away
with your mind.

215
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:10,080
Which one of your sorry
friends has telekinesis?

216
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:12,160
None of 'em do.

217
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:17,042
Right... that guy who was
chasing Claire in Texas.

218
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:20,092
- He sent some lockers flying at me.
- Texas?

219
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:22,711
And you pulled that little
trick out in the here and now?

220
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:29,011
Well, we might just have a chance
at stopping you from going nuclear.

221
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,233
I tried.

222
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:41,021
Every street I painted,
every building... empty.

223
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:43,903
I think Peter's left New York.

224
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:46,660
Why does this seem so familiar?

225
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,623
Oh, now I remember.

226
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,662
You'd get that same
look on your face

227
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:52,831
when you'd lie to
me about using.

228
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:54,833
You think I'm lying?

229
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:58,170
You're right.

230
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:00,671
I can't willingly throw you
into another man's arms.

231
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,773
- Because you're jealous.
- Because he's dangerous.

232
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,010
Oh, God.

233
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:09,222
I don't think I should
have this anymore.

234
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:15,182
No. Keep it. Please.

235
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,272
I would do anything
for you, Simone.

236
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,982
Anything.

237
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:24,991
Find Peter.

238
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,971
Look, you're nothing but a
Japanese MapQuest for me.

239
00:14:47,228 --> 00:14:49,132
So till we find that girl,

240
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:51,640
just sit there and shut up.

241
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:54,063
I bring Ando from
Japan on my mission.

242
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:55,771
I am responsible for him.

243
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,810
All a partner ever does is either
drag you under or screw you over.

244
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,503
A partner helps by
believing in you.

245
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:03,023
He keeps you honest.

246
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:04,980
Uh-huh. Well.

247
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,530
Who  wanted to help the girl?

248
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:09,113
Grab the suitcase?

249
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:12,492
Take your car?

250
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,120
Ando.

251
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:18,291
You take on a partner,

252
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:22,541
all you get is their
blood on your hands.

253
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,262
Why are we stopping here?

254
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,552
I thought we were going
to your mother's house.

255
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,512
The less questions
you ask, Ando,

256
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:37,181
the better off
you'll be in life.

257
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:38,642
Why is that?

258
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,393
That'd be another question.

259
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:50,032
- Here, I will help you with...
- No, I've got it.

260
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:51,571
- It's okay...
- No...

261
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:53,702
What is this?

262
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,212
What did I say about
asking questions?

263
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,341
You know,
I have to admit, Zane,

264
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:10,273
when you first offered to help,
I was...

265
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:13,221
- I was cautious.
- In what way?

266
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:14,511
I don't know you.

267
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:16,973
You don't know me.
It could have been a disaster.

268
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:21,772
You... made a difference today.
Thank you.

269
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,400
Here is your key.

270
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,481
When you told that woman Dale

271
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,111
that you could help her,

272
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:32,113
is that really possible?

273
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,240
It's only theoretical
at this point.

274
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,120
But I am working
on an inhibitor,

275
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,292
a chemical that'll isolate
the genetic mutation

276
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:40,163
that causes
these abnormalities.

277
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,870
We can offer these people
understanding, control,

278
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,540
or, if needed,
elimination of their ability.

279
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:49,460
Elimination? You make it 
sound like a virus or plague.

280
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,260
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to imply...

281
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:55,802
It's just not all of you exhibit
the same sets of skills you do.

282
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:57,762
And they can be dangerous.

283
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:00,271
My father had to
learn that firsthand.

284
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,352
How's that?

285
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:08,110
He was murdered by
a man named Sylar.

286
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:11,032
Well, what happened to this...

287
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:12,652
Sylar?

288
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:15,911
I'm  not sure.

289
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:19,452
He just got away with
killing your dad?

290
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:22,453
I only know he's gone,
locked away.

291
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:23,962
What does it matter?

292
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:26,930
Even if I could come face-to-face with
him, what difference would it make?

293
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,921
Justice can never
really be served.

294
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,632
What a shame.

295
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:34,473
They're out there.

296
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:38,101
I can feel them...

297
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:42,771
So innocent,
so unaware of what's happening to them.

298
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,063
We'll find them, Mohinder.

299
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,772
All of them, together.
The two of us.

300
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,570
It's our destiny.

301
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,951
I'm gonna call it a night.

302
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,162
I'll catch you in the morning.

303
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,883
Claire, do we need to talk?

304
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:17,013
No.

305
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:23,600
Yes.

306
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:29,023
Mom, you know how you
sometimes forget things?

307
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,610
Honey, is this about my
trip to the neurologist?

308
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,192
It's just some headaches.

309
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,940
I don't want you to worry.

310
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:40,033
But they don't know
what's causing it, right?

311
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:45,500
We are still waiting on
the results from the tests.

312
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,503
What if it's not some thing

313
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:52,001
that's responsible
for it but someone?

314
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:55,463
What on earth are
you talking about?

315
00:18:55,716 --> 00:18:57,420
What if you knew a secret,

316
00:18:57,728 --> 00:19:00,051
and they had a way
to brainwash you?

317
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,141
You have been
studying long enough.

318
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,100
Let's curl up in my bed,
piece of pie, glass of milk,

319
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,902
and watch an old
Cary Grant movie.

320
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,731
Mom, I'm serious.

321
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,442
I know this is a little scary,

322
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:19,283
but Dad's in charge of
talking to the doctors,

323
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:21,701
and they will come
up with the answers.

324
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:27,083
Maybe you shouldn't
trust Dad so much.

325
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,043
Now, why would you say that?

326
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:30,872
What if it gets worse...

327
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:33,750
and next time that you...

328
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,422
Mom!

329
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:37,593
Mom!

330
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,470
Mom! Mom!

331
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:45,142
Mom!

332
00:19:46,356 --> 00:19:48,392
Mom, please wake up.

333
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,861
What's this all about anyways?

334
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:56,280
- What's what?
- The birds.

335
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,190
I mean, you...

336
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:00,903
you sort of hate
everything, everyone.

337
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,491
Except you treat these
pigeons like they're family.

338
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,872
Charles Darwin bred pigeons

339
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,583
when he was working out
his theory of evolution.

340
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:12,793
Married up various permutations
to get maximum potential.

341
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:16,340
What do you mean by that,
maximum potential?

342
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,422
I think he meant you, friend.

343
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:23,972
But you used to care.

344
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:25,850
About all this.

345
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:30,021
Didn't you? 

346
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:33,403
All right, sharing time's over.

347
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,771
Time to get...

348
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:53,543
- What are you doing?
- Something unexpected.

349
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,531
Claire, this isn't
a great time.

350
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:30,453
Dad, you have to come home.

351
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,753
Mom fell and she blacked out.

352
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,412
I called 911...

353
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,170
What  happened to her?

354
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:39,710
I came home and she didn't
even know who I was.

355
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,010
She didn't even
remember Mr. Muggles.

356
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:47,430
I'm coming home right away.

357
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:50,932
Claude'll have to wait.

358
00:21:57,405 --> 00:22:00,481
- Matt, where are you?
- Hey, what's up?

359
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:02,281
The ring.

360
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:05,240
I took it to get resized,

361
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,741
and the jeweler told me
it was worth $40,000.

362
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,331
Well, that's ridiculous.

363
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:13,410
And he accused me
of stealing it.

364
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,183
I had to tell him my
husband was a cop

365
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:17,053
and there has to be some
kind of an explanation.

366
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,331
There is an explanation, right?

367
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:29,803
The guy that I was
protecting, Malsky...

368
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:32,512
those were his.

369
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:34,392
- You have to give them back.
- I can't.

370
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,771
I can't. He's dead.

371
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:39,813
- Hmm. Uh, I need to sit down.
- See...

372
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:42,500
Honey, this is why I didn't want
to tell you about this, okay?

373
00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:44,941
- You were gonna get upset...
- You let me keep the ring.

374
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:47,400
It was stolen property.
What were you thinking?

375
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,370
I don't know what
I was thinking.

376
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,623
- I have no idea.
- You know, Matt, for a guy that can...

377
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,500
read other people's thoughts,

378
00:22:55,837 --> 00:22:57,632
you should spend a little
bit of time on your own.

379
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,791
You know what?

380
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,050
I'm just trying to figure out
how to take care of our family.

381
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,752
I don't have a job, Jan.

382
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:04,551
And I'm worried
that the baby...

383
00:23:04,845 --> 00:23:06,441
Ever since you told
me about this thing,

384
00:23:06,477 --> 00:23:07,880
this thing that you do,

385
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:11,091
I have tried to act like
everything's okay, but it's not.

386
00:23:11,436 --> 00:23:13,601
It's stealing and lying.

387
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:16,312
Matt, you're better than this!

388
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:20,403
All right.

389
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:22,690
Fine, I'll take them
down to the precinct.

390
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:27,782
- Call them right now.
- What?

391
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:29,570
Call them right now.

392
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,333
Hello?

393
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,122
What?

394
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:40,872
Where are you right now?

395
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:43,293
Yeah.

396
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:44,550
Yeah, I know the place.

397
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:46,553
- I'll be right there.
- Who was that?

398
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:50,260
- I, uh, I gotta go out.
- Where?

399
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:51,762
Matt.

400
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,852
How you feeling?

401
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:05,691
You knew they were after you.

402
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:07,282
Who? I don't know
who they were!

403
00:24:07,658 --> 00:24:09,582
You wanted to know why I was
invisible all these years.

404
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:10,741
It was because of them,

405
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,031
and you've brought the
bastards right to my door!

406
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:14,913
I just saved your ass!

407
00:24:15,168 --> 00:24:16,832
You've no idea
what you've done.

408
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:24,592
Your mate, the painter.

409
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,302
He took your girl
up to the roof.

410
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:28,382
- He must have known we were up there.
- Isaac.

411
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:31,180
- He's a comic book artist.
- Let's call a spade a shovel, mate.

412
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,472
It had to be Isaac.
They got to him.

413
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:35,932
You said yourself he
disappeared for a bit, right?

414
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:38,222
- Yeah, so?
- Well, that's how it works.

415
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,352
At least,
that's how it did in my day.

416
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,601
You drop off the face of
the earth for a few days,

417
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:45,151
wake up with a memory hole,
a killer headache,

418
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:46,901
and a souvenir.

419
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,731
Did he have a set of these?

420
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:51,821
I don't know. What is that?

421
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:52,922
Those are for the lucky ones.

422
00:24:52,957 --> 00:24:54,570
So what do we do now... hey!

423
00:24:54,747 --> 00:24:55,953
We?

424
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,531
You watch your own back.

425
00:24:57,836 --> 00:24:59,703
I do what I always
do... disappear.

426
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:02,512
I'm not letting you run again.
We're getting somewhere with all this.

427
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:04,041
You should have thought of that

428
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,761
before you brought your
baggage to my roof.

429
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:09,423
- I can't do this on my own.
- Then I guess you go boom.

430
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:17,890
Have you heard from Peter?

431
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,393
Last time I saw my brother,

432
00:25:20,396 --> 00:25:22,730
he flew out of a window
to get away from me.

433
00:25:22,946 --> 00:25:24,820
I doubt he's going to
come knocking on my door.

434
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,691
- He flew out a window?
- So to speak.

435
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:32,440
Simone, I've got people looking for him,
people I can trust.

436
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:36,030
Around the clock.
We'll find him.

437
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:37,701
But what if you don't?

438
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,123
You need to go public,

439
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,450
call a press conference,

440
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,411
tell everyone about
Peter's condition.

441
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:44,122
Nobody's gonna believe

442
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:47,921
somebody can explode and
destroy a city, Simone.

443
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,922
- I can't believe I believe it.
- Let's tell them everything.

444
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,130
Isaac painting the future,
Hiro stopping time.

445
00:25:55,135 --> 00:25:58,722
Even you...
what you all can do is incredible.

446
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,770
It's time people know
what's happening.

447
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:03,022
The truth.

448
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:04,941
Simone, look,
I know your heart...

449
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,813
it's in the right place.

450
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:09,730
You want to help Peter,
and I want to help him too.

451
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:13,441
But if people knew what
we were capable of,

452
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,862
they would drop a
collective brick.

453
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,331
You think they'll burn
you at the stake?

454
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,032
Yeah, pretty much.

455
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:22,372
Because that's what I would do.
I'd round us all up,

456
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:26,213
stick us in a lab on some island
in the middle of the ocean.

457
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,751
Where Peter saw hope,
you see disaster.

458
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:32,711
I guess I'm voting
for the other guy.

459
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:38,721
Simone.

460
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,681
Do not take this public.

461
00:26:53,535 --> 00:26:54,690
But you kissed me.

462
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:57,360
- I thought you liked me.
- Don't remind me.

463
00:26:58,998 --> 00:27:00,531
What will happen to me now?

464
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:04,661
Damn it!

465
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:07,963
Hope!

466
00:27:08,296 --> 00:27:09,462
I want my share.

467
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:11,631
- Ando!
- Hiro!

468
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,882
Ando!

469
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:32,652
Ando!

470
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:34,900
This way hurry!

471
00:27:41,497 --> 00:27:42,913
Hiro. I'm sorry.

472
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:45,373
I should've listened to you.

473
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,331
No, this is all my fault.

474
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,080
I never should have...

475
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,041
brought you on my mission.

476
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:53,750
And if you didn't...

477
00:27:54,136 --> 00:27:55,711
I would be at my desk in Tokyo.

478
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,173
I would never know...

479
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:58,801
what is it to be a hero.

480
00:28:07,648 --> 00:28:09,522
I don't want to die!

481
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:31,541
Did your powers work?

482
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,752
I had my eyes closed!

483
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:35,131
Me too.

484
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:38,092
Her gun must have misfired.

485
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:41,683
I guess...

486
00:28:41,848 --> 00:28:43,341
Lucky for us!

487
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:48,060
Look Ando!

488
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,351
Not a scratch on the Versa!

489
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:19,211
Funny. I didn't hear
your footsteps.

490
00:29:20,965 --> 00:29:23,220
That's because
there weren't any.

491
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:27,801
That sound.

492
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:29,970
In your heart.

493
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:32,851
What is it?

494
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,230
Murder.

495
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:57,543
Is my mom gonna be okay?

496
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:00,550
She's stable.

497
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:04,261
When your dad gets here,
we can discuss options.

498
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,590
Options?

499
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:11,391
Claire, why don't
you come sit down.

500
00:30:12,817 --> 00:30:14,982
Your mother has a
subdural hemorrhage.

501
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:17,191
I got a C-minus in biology.

502
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:19,771
Oh. It's, um...

503
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,150
it's like a bruise
on her brain.

504
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:26,151
Specifically the area
that controls memory.

505
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:31,370
Has your mother had any
recent exposure to radiation?

506
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:34,661
A history of epilepsy?

507
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:41,091
Claire, if this is a result
of domestic violence...

508
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:44,632
No. No, it's not like that.

509
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,301
Not really.

510
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:51,142
Then what's it like?

511
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,851
You won't believe me.

512
00:30:56,947 --> 00:31:00,521
Anything you say will be held
in the strictest confidence.

513
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:06,573
There's a man...

514
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:09,532
who works for my dad.

515
00:31:11,418 --> 00:31:13,700
He can make you forget things.

516
00:31:15,378 --> 00:31:16,751
Anything,

517
00:31:17,128 --> 00:31:19,583
just by touching
you with his hands.

518
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,962
I'll talk to your father.

519
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,882
Wait, I'm telling
you the truth!

520
00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:45,072
Hey, I only came here

521
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:47,152
because you said it was a
matter of life and death.

522
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:49,070
You can't go blowing
anything else up.

523
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,992
I found out what these are.

524
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:53,740
They're tracking us.
Like animals!

525
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,162
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

526
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,830
The truth.

527
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,330
Hey! What's going on? Ted?

528
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:02,922
She's... she's a friend,
okay, like us.

529
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:05,300
She's the one who put
me onto the scratches.

530
00:32:05,636 --> 00:32:07,551
It comes from a
pneumatic needle.

531
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:12,342
It injects a radioisotope for
tracking viruses in Africa.

532
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:13,931
That's what we are to them,

533
00:32:14,185 --> 00:32:16,773
a-a virus. A plague.

534
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:18,813
Who's them?

535
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:23,061
A shipment of needles went to
Primatech Paper in Odessa, Texas.

536
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:26,531
The tracking slip went
to a man named Bennet.

537
00:32:26,785 --> 00:32:29,532
- Sound familiar?
- I've already been down this road.

538
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,112
Trust me, it's a dead end.

539
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,242
- Really?
- Yeah.

540
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:38,291
Why would a paper company need
pneumatic needles with a radioisotope?

541
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:40,621
I had my blood tested.

542
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:44,792
- It's in me, that isotope.
- Ted, you're radioactive by nature.

543
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:47,171
How much you wanna
bet it's in you too?

544
00:32:47,845 --> 00:32:50,173
No, it's insane. No!

545
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,061
I want to put this
whole thing behind me.

546
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:54,603
My wife and I have a baby coming,
my family needs me.

547
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:57,233
If you got a family,
that means you got something to protect.

548
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,220
There is no putting this
whole thing behind you.

549
00:32:59,526 --> 00:33:01,732
We gotta find out what they
did and make them fix it!

550
00:33:01,987 --> 00:33:03,701
If they can track us
like you say they can,

551
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,650
- he'll know we're coming.
- Good.

552
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:07,980
I can get us through
any wall they got.

553
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:10,153
I need you to get
inside his head.

554
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:13,910
He can't lie to us
if you're there.

555
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,950
We'll find out the truth.

556
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:25,081
Look, I cannot do this...
without you.

557
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:29,761
If we can save ourselves,
we could help others.

558
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:31,592
We could be heroes!

559
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:41,642
Dad.

560
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,542
I've convinced the doctor to let
us take her home in the morning.

561
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,451
- She'll be okay.
- No thanks to you.

562
00:33:57,456 --> 00:33:58,910
Shut up, Claire.

563
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:02,750
Claire, can I talk
to you outside?

564
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:04,752
Please?

565
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:16,300
The doctor told me you
had an interesting theory

566
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:19,102
- about your mom's condition.
- It's not a theory.

567
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:22,563
You did this to her.
You erased her mind.

568
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:25,981
Claire, that's ridiculous.

569
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,901
You tried to erase mine.

570
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:29,911
I don't know where you're
getting these ideas.

571
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:33,362
Stop. Stop it! Stop lying!

572
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,412
After what you did to Mom,
isn't that enough?

573
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,542
What you know is dangerous.

574
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:44,583
If the wrong people find
out about what you can do...

575
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:47,003
- Like the man who killed Jackie?
- Exactly.

576
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:48,293
Why?

577
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:51,131
Why did you do this to Mom?

578
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:55,262
A few days ago,
that man broke into our house...

579
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:57,471
looking for you.

580
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,101
He found your mother instead.

581
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:02,561
So I made her forget.

582
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,353
Your mother is a gentle soul.

583
00:35:05,608 --> 00:35:08,943
And people like her shouldn't have
to know about people like him.

584
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,441
And maybe people like you.

585
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,363
I never meant for
her to get sick.

586
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,990
I only wanted to
protect my family.

587
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:24,081
Claire bear, I promise...

588
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:28,673
I promise this will
never happen again.

589
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:30,292
No!

590
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:36,510
You don't just get
to say you're sorry

591
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:38,432
and make everything go away.

592
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:55,652
Zane, are you all right?

593
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:59,240
Yeah, it's just, uh,
it's just a headache.

594
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,913
Okay. Sit tight. I'll be back.

595
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:09,871
Hello?

596
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:13,672
Anybody here?

597
00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:17,591
Hey, maybe we should just
come back, Mohinder.

598
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:19,592
Dale?

599
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:35,320
Mohinder, what's the matter?

600
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:50,371
- What are you doing?
- Dialing 911.

601
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,941
Do you think that's
a good idea?

602
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,683
What are you talking about?
She was murdered.

603
00:36:53,715 --> 00:36:54,833
And what were we doing here?

604
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:56,203
What do you mean? We found her.

605
00:36:56,555 --> 00:36:58,511
How? Why? I mean, l-look at us.

606
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:00,600
Where did we come from?
How did we get here?

607
00:37:00,728 --> 00:37:03,182
Can we explain any of this
without looking completely insane?

608
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:05,220
The top of her
head was removed.

609
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:07,603
It was Sylar.
I don't... I mean, how?

610
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:10,771
Sylar. Okay,
we have to warn them.

611
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,640
Everyone on the list.
He's after them.

612
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:14,101
We'll, uh, we'll leave now

613
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:16,482
and we'll call the police
anonymously from the road.

614
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:21,743
Zane, are you okay?

615
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:56,943
Hiro, my arm still
hurts a little.

616
00:37:57,406 --> 00:37:58,771
You should drive.

617
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,073
No, you always drive.

618
00:38:02,535 --> 00:38:05,492
Take the Versa back to
the rental car place.

619
00:38:06,455 --> 00:38:07,991
What are you doing?

620
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,993
What I should've
done weeks ago.

621
00:38:11,797 --> 00:38:14,290
Go home, Ando.

622
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:17,420
Why are you doing this?

623
00:38:17,678 --> 00:38:19,591
I said I was sorry
about the girl.

624
00:38:19,888 --> 00:38:20,880
This isn't about you.

625
00:38:21,595 --> 00:38:23,090
It's about me.

626
00:38:24,558 --> 00:38:29,051
I made a mistake by
bringing you along.

627
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:31,272
I have to do this alone.

628
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:34,142
But you can't! It's destiny!

629
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,101
The comic-book...
we're going to save the world!

630
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,692
Life isn't a comic book.

631
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:42,443
Too many people have
died since we began.

632
00:38:43,078 --> 00:38:45,241
I don't know what I would do...

633
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:47,161
if I lost you too.

634
00:38:57,965 --> 00:38:59,753
Hiro, please.

635
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:01,881
Hiro!

636
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,473
Hey, young fella.
All by yourself?

637
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:15,773
Yes, just me.

638
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:20,271
Lyle.

639
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:28,820
Claire.

640
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:30,742
We'll get through this.

641
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,542
Your mom needs us. Lyle too.

642
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:37,332
I don't even know if I'll
remember any of this tomorrow.

643
00:39:37,795 --> 00:39:40,832
All I want to do is run away,
but I can't.

644
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:44,132
Somebody has to protect
this family from you.

645
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:51,392
Lyle, take your mother.

646
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:55,522
- Get out of the house right now.
- Dad?

647
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:03,020
I'm sure you have
a lot of questions.

648
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:05,903
We all do.

649
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:40,733
- Why'd you do it, Isaac?
- How'd you get in here?

650
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:43,872
What'd they give you,
money? Drugs?

651
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:47,071
- What's a Judas get these days?
- I was trying to stop you.

652
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:49,032
You're dangerous.
You said it yourself.

653
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:52,572
Without them to help,
you'll become that.

654
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:53,782
I had help.

655
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:55,741
I was learning to control it.

656
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:58,830
- You scared my only chance of hope!
- Stop it!

657
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:02,120
What are these marks, huh?
What do they mean?

658
00:41:04,138 --> 00:41:05,883
They're nothing.
They mean nothing.

659
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,502
Don't lie to me!

660
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,973
This is why you
sent them after me.

661
00:41:16,147 --> 00:41:17,512
Jealousy?

662
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,853
With me out of the way,

663
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:20,393
you'd have Simone
all to yourself.

664
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,562
You stole her away from me!

665
00:41:27,327 --> 00:41:29,230
But I did it to save New York,

666
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:30,941
to stop the bomb.

667
00:41:33,078 --> 00:41:34,492
I can do it right now.

668
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:38,291
With just one bullet,
I can be a hero.

669
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,503
You're not a hero, Isaac.

670
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,001
You're a junkie.

671
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,880
You couldn't even
save yourself.

672
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,683
That's why she left you, Isaac.

673
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:59,351
It had nothing...
to do... with me!

674
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:02,143
Show yourself!

675
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,081
Simone!

676
00:42:24,796 --> 00:42:27,210
Simone. Simone.

677
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:31,512
No. No.

678
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:45,313
