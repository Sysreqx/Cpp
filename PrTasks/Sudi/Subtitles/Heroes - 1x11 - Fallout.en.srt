1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,503
Previously on Heroes.

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,755
Ordinary people
across the globe

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,424
discovered
extraordinary abilities.

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,511
Niki's alter ego
sought revenge...

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,180
- Must really hate the guy.
- He took my son.

6
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,391
...and took the
ultimate retribution.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,936
Peter set out on his mission...

8
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,521
I know when,

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,035
and I know where the cheerleader
gets attacked. I have to stop him.

10
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,980
... to save the Cheerleader.

11
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,401
By saving you,
did I save the world?

12
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:35,611
I don't know.
I'm just a cheerleader.

13
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:37,870
But he was taken
by the police...

14
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:39,482
Put your hands on your head!

15
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:42,073
It's not what you think, guys!
What are you do...

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,540
And Sylar was
finally captured...

17
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:47,541
You don't want to hurt me.
Go to sleep.

18
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:51,761
And Claire revealed a secret
that would change her life...

19
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,800
- You're lucky to be alive.
- It's not luck, Dad.

20
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,053
I have something I
have to tell you.

21
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:00,313
And now Heroes continues.

22
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:15,782
Are you mad at me?

23
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,371
You haven't said anything
since we got in the car.

24
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,833
Since I told you.

25
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,502
No, no, no, I just...

26
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,670
I've just been thinking.

27
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:32,672
Um... I have something
I need to tell you.

28
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,723
It's not fair to keep
it from you any longer.

29
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:39,933
What you can do...

30
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:45,523
I've known about you, Claire.

31
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:49,312
I knew before you knew.
Before you made those tapes with Zach.

32
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:51,151
You saw the tape?

33
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,940
- Why didn't you say anything?
- There are a lot of reasons.

34
00:01:56,247 --> 00:01:58,252
But mostly,
I just wanted to protect you.

35
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,321
Protect me?
All this time, I've...

36
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:04,243
felt so alone,
and like some sort of freak.

37
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,240
- And you knew?
- I've worked very hard.

38
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:09,630
I've done some things that I am
not proud of to keep you safe.

39
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:11,291
What kinds of things?

40
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:17,302
I just wanted you to
have a normal life.

41
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,762
Jackie died because of me.

42
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:25,772
He thought she was me,
didn't he?

43
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:30,851
That man is taken care of.
I promise you.

44
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:35,151
- You and mom knew all this time?
- Your mother doesn't know.

45
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,780
Neither does your brother.

46
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:42,072
- Actually, Lyle kind of found out.
- Really?

47
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:45,913
- Did anybody else?
- Just Zach.

48
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,373
Nobody else can know.
It's the only way to keep you safe.

49
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:51,963
That man who tried to kill you,

50
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,253
there are others
out there like him.

51
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,141
Who want what you have and
will hurt you to get it.

52
00:02:57,388 --> 00:03:00,381
That's why we can't tell your mother.
We can't tell anybody.

53
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:04,391
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:08,672
I'm gonna pick Lyle up from practice,
and I'll talk to him.

55
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:11,442
You talk to Zach.
Any other tapes you've made...

56
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:13,863
I need you to destroy them.

57
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:21,361
The victim was a student:
Jacqueline Wilcox.

58
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,030
And the crime scene
fits Sylar's M.O.

59
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:25,373
He took her brain?

60
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:29,933
No, but the incision in her skull said
he wanted to, but somebody got in
his way.

61
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:33,063
They have a suspect in custody,
a hospice nurse from New York.

62
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:35,341
- And you think he might be Sylar?
- No.

63
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:37,252
I think this is.

64
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:42,051
Judging by the blood patterns, I'd say
he stopped here to catch his breath,

65
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,931
and then just... disappeared.

66
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:45,053
You know what?

67
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:46,600
Maybe he didn't.

68
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,353
Look at this.

69
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:52,821
The tread pattern's totally different.
These are two new sets of footprints.

70
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:57,231
- That's the fourth handful of those you knocked down since...
- I have headaches!

71
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,072
It's the whole Janice
thing, it's...

72
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:04,490
She slipped out, Parkman.
And it sucks, but it happens.

73
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:07,122
- You've never cheated on her?
- No.

74
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:11,330
- You don't believe me.
- Well, statistically speaking,

75
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,053
law enforcement attracts a
certain kind of male personality.

76
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,423
- Oh, what personality would that be?
- Dogs.

77
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:19,591
- And the female personality?
- Mmm, bitches.

78
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:21,722
We keep it in the
canine family.

79
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:25,720
Okay, so two new sets of footprints.
You think Sylar had accomplices?

80
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:29,320
With the amount of blood he lost,
there's no way he got out of here
by himself.

81
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:33,732
So I guess we'll ask this...
Peter Petrelli.

82
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:37,440
Chapter Eleven - Fallout

83
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:46,782
Nathan.

84
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,451
What are you...
What are you doing here?

85
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,163
You get in trouble,
I drop everything and fix it.

86
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:54,002
Isn't that how things work?

87
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:58,422
- Get you out of here soon.
- What, no lecture?

88
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:00,753
I'm just glad
you're alive, man.

89
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:02,842
Why did you destroy
that painting?

90
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:05,062
Why did you try and keep
me from coming here?

91
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,260
The painting showed
you dead, Peter.

92
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:09,820
And when I got the phone call,
I nearly believed it for a minute.

93
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:13,101
- Yeah, I thought I'd be a hero.
- Yeah, heh.

94
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,850
How'd that work out for you?

95
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:17,152
Save the cheerleader,
save the world.

96
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,482
You're meant to do a
lot of things, Peter.

97
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:23,281
Saving the world
isn't one of them.

98
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,752
You gotta learn to recognize when
life is bigger than you are.

99
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,240
You're  not a fighter. But that's okay.
The world needs nurses too.

100
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:33,832
When I'm around you,
I can do what you can do.

101
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:38,541
Isaac, Hiro Nakamura,
this girl Claire.

102
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,922
See, I think that we're
all the same somehow.

103
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:45,313
And this bomb that Isaac painted,
I think we're supposed to stop it.

104
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:46,722
But I just...

105
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:51,391
I don't think I can do it.

106
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,023
That's because you can't.

107
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,520
How can you stop what's coming?

108
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:02,523
When you don't know
anything about power?

109
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:34,522
- Micah!
- Dad!

110
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,481
Stay down!

111
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:03,793
What  are you looking at?

112
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:20,733
- Anything?
- Slept through the night.

113
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:30,820
I got this.

114
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:46,210
You lost a lot of blood.

115
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:49,803
We sewed you up
the best we could.

116
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,470
Turns out you're not so
untouchable after all.

117
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:57,720
Oh, no.

118
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:01,193
No, you'll find your
abilities won't work. Not here.

119
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:05,773
- You're not going anywhere, Gabriel.
- My name is Sylar.

120
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:07,112
Now it is.

121
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:09,940
Wasn't so long ago that
you were Gabriel Gray.

122
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:13,032
An insignificant watchmaker.

123
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,530
I restored timepieces.

124
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,662
Do you know why I
was so good at it?

125
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,621
No, why don't you tell me.

126
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:25,752
Because I can see
how things work.

127
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:31,841
What makes things...
tick. Like you.

128
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:34,513
We're interested in how
things work as well.

129
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,433
Everyone else we've...
met has had only one ability.

130
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:42,313
- You've taken on several.
- I guess that's what makes me special.

131
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:45,060
That's important to you, isn't it?
Being special.

132
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:48,000
- It's important to everyone.
- I think you're insane.

133
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:53,030
I think the infusion of so many
alterations to your DNA has corrupted
your mind.

134
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:57,370
- All this power is degrading you.
- And yet here I am, alive and well,

135
00:08:57,668 --> 00:09:01,791
and as soon as I get out, I'm gonna
collect one more ability from
your daughter.

136
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:04,500
- Sweet, innocent.
- That's enough.

137
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,672
- Ripe, indestructible.
- I said that's enough, Gabriel.

138
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:11,132
My name is Sylar!

139
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,352
Options? There are no options
with an individual like this.

140
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,402
Maybe I didn't make
the risk clear...

141
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:32,153
- Understood. Of course.
- Is it true?

142
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:34,462
You have to be a little
bit more specific, Eden.

143
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:36,670
I've got more than one
house on fire at the moment.

144
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,661
- We're keeping him alive.
- Those are our marching orders.

145
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:41,951
Think about what he
almost did to Claire.

146
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:44,830
I could tell him
to kill himself.

147
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:50,041
No one would have to know.

148
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,970
I don't have time for this.
Not today.

149
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:06,480
You know I'm right!
I know I'm right, and if that...

150
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:09,810
that Haitian could speak,
he'd tell you I'm right!

151
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,833
Micah, take that.

152
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,003
Here, take... That's it.

153
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:34,000
Walk back the way you came.

154
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:35,420
In the footsteps.

155
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:36,920
Come on.

156
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:40,682
- Oh. Like the Indians.
- Just like the Indians, son.

157
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:45,393
- That wasn't the police.
- You don't know that.

158
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:49,440
Dad, they've gotta warn you
before they shoot. It's a rule.

159
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:52,490
The  police don't always follow
the rules, son. Trust me.

160
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,281
Give me a hand.

161
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:02,413
Right here. Okay.

162
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:43,991
Dad, are you gonna be okay?

163
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:47,952
I'm gonna be as good as new.

164
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:50,603
I just need you to help
me with these bandages.

165
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,502
- You can do that, right?
- Yeah.

166
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,292
Yeah? All right.

167
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:58,210
It was her, wasn't it?

168
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:00,010
It was Jessica.

169
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:03,890
It sure looked like your mom.

170
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:08,353
Mom would never hurt
you on purpose.

171
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:11,103
She just did, Micah.

172
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:14,153
A couple inches to
the left... and...

173
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,150
Dad?

174
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:21,613
Dad, wake up!

175
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:23,953
Dad, you need to wake up!

176
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:27,300
Your brother's pretty
well connected.

177
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,582
Even down here.

178
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:32,751
We had to climb over six lawyers
to get to you, Mr. Petrelli.

179
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:35,633
Are you okay?

180
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,302
My head feels like
it's gonna split open.

181
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:40,212
Help yourself.

182
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,472
- I didn't kill that girl.
- We know.

183
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:46,851
The blood we found
on you was your own.

184
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:49,233
We checked you out,
and you don't seem to have any injuries.

185
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:50,813
Care to explain that?

186
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:55,150
If I'm not being charged,
can I go?

187
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:59,200
What's a hospice nurse from Manhattan
doing at a high school homecoming
in Texas?

188
00:12:59,326 --> 00:13:01,030
You some kind of pervert?

189
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:06,240
My brother said not to talk.

190
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,330
We don't need you to talk.

191
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,050
What are you doing to me?

192
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:33,352
"Save the cheerleader"?

193
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:35,891
Too late for that.
The cheerleader's dead.

194
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:39,732
Claire's dead?
No, that's not possible.

195
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:43,190
Did he just read her mind?
Is he one of them?

196
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:45,900
The cheerleader's name
was Jackie Wilcox.

197
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:48,383
- What the hell is going on...
- No, Claire is the one that he wanted.

198
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,131
- Claire?
- You're not protecting her?!

199
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:52,592
- Why would you know who he wanted?
- You wanna catch this guy?

200
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:55,081
You need to find her.
You need to protect her!

201
00:13:56,465 --> 00:14:00,423
- He's telling the truth.
- Then we better find this cheerleader.

202
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:04,721
- You're not gonna let me out of here?
- You get out when I get answers.

203
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:27,033
Welcome Home! I knew you'd be back!
Now get back to work. Love Eden.

204
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,410
I faxed the list to your
Quantico office yesterday!

205
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:35,123
Names, addresses.
Why didn't you warn them?

206
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:38,511
Looking into it? At least six of
the people on this list are dead,

207
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,883
all of them from
the same killer.

208
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:43,841
James Walker in Los Angeles
was killed nine days ago.

209
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,473
Charlene Andrews two days ago,
Midland, Texas.

210
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,681
Doesn't this mean
anything to you people?

211
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:51,130
Well, do you really want
to take that chance?

212
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:55,431
Fine, I won't. Never mind.

213
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,240
You're sketching.

214
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,622
I am.

215
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:19,581
- And you're sober.
- The locks on the door help.

216
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:24,462
- Anything interesting?
- Nothing predictive, if that's what you're asking.

217
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:27,212
I don't think I
can do it clean.

218
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:28,973
You'll get there.

219
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:32,301
To be honest, it's nice to be
drawing just to draw again.

220
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:35,863
That's what I liked about comics. You
don't have to take them too seriously.

221
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:38,271
Good guys catching bad guys?

222
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:42,102
Which reminds me... Claire.

223
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:45,613
The cheerleader... She's alive.

224
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:49,901
- Peter? He saved her?
- No, you did.

225
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:52,491
With your gift.
I mean, thanks to you,

226
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:55,453
Sylar won't be able to
hurt anybody anymore.

227
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:59,501
This means we can change the future.
Maybe stop that bomb.

228
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:01,963
Well, I wish you
the best of luck.

229
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:03,332
What?

230
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:06,093
- Where you going?
- Off the reservation.

231
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,132
You're leaving?

232
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:12,971
Well, what good is painting the future
if no one will do anything to change it?

233
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,810
So change it.

234
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,533
I couldn't save Charlie.

235
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:40,042
And now the Cheerleader
is dead too.

236
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:41,541
"The earth is doomed?"

237
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,006
"Save the Cheerleader,
save the world"

238
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:45,633
We failed to save her,

239
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,930
- so now we can't save the world.
- No, no.

240
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:51,421
"Save the Cheerleader."
Then "Save the world."

241
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,431
-  No, it's an "if, then" statement.
- How do you know?

242
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,052
I was the one who said it!

243
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:58,933
"Future you" doesn't
count as you!

244
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,731
Never mind.

245
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:03,522
Two people died.

246
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:07,023
If we don't continue
they died for nothing.

247
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:08,863
We will find a way.

248
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:10,440
We must.

249
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,071
How?

250
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:14,820
Get back on mission.

251
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,870
Find Peter Petrelli.

252
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:18,743
Find the artist.

253
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:20,333
Stop the bomb.

254
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,621
Destiny hasn't forgotten us.

255
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:31,001
- Hello?
- Hiro?

256
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:33,052
- Hiro Nakamura?
- Yes?

257
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:35,473
- This is Isaac Mendez.
- Mr. Isaac?!

258
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:39,351
- Hiro... we need to meet.
- Who is it?

259
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:40,811
Destiny!

260
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:43,063
I wish...

261
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,562
Destiny would lose our number.

262
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,901
And then he grabbed her and...

263
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:51,402
and I tried to save her, but...
he was killing her, and...

264
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:56,822
She told me to run, so I ran.

265
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,703
I left her and I ran.

266
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:03,683
I'm sorry, Claire.
I know you've been through a lot.

267
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:05,541
I just have a few
more questions.

268
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:07,710
This man...

269
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:10,963
Did he exhibit anything
out of the ordinary?

270
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:18,800
You  mean besides
killing my friend?

271
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:25,182
- No, like being able to fall five stories and walk away without a scratch.
- What?

272
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:28,403
Well, you said Petrelli tackled
the man who killed Jackie,

273
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:32,021
and they both fell over the ledge.
That's a pretty long fall.

274
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:40,822
- Is Peter okay?
- He survived... without a scratch.

275
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,293
- How do you think he did that?
- All I know is he saved my life.

276
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:48,373
He's a very lucky guy.

277
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:51,083
You didn't seem to get
hurt at all, either.

278
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,803
Guess I'm lucky too.

279
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:57,391
We found some of your
blood at the crime scene.

280
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,682
Look, I've told you
everything I know, okay?

281
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:02,550
Do you have what you need,
Agent Hanson?

282
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,680
Yes... of course.

283
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:09,441
Thank you both very
much for your time.

284
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:11,900
Wait, can I talk to Peter?

285
00:19:14,697 --> 00:19:16,782
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

286
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:20,131
Mr. Bennet, I just want to let you know
that we're doing everything in our power
to, uh,

287
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,870
- to get this guy.
- Well, I appreciate that, Mr...

288
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:28,003
Uh, Parkman.
Uh, Officer Matt Parkman.

289
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:31,083
I really appreciate that,
Officer Parkman. Thank you.

290
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:40,051
You don't have to be a mind reader
to know she's hiding something.

291
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:42,640
- What is it?
- I didn't get anything.

292
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,811
I mean, I...
there was this distinct...

293
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,561
- absence of sound.
- You mean silence?

294
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,493
No, it was more like a static
interfering with my...

295
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,750
- Whatever the hell this thing is.
- That's a new one.

296
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:56,792
No, it's not, actually.
I've heard this before.

297
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:58,323
Once, when I went to that bar.

298
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:02,112
It's the last thing that I heard,
or didn't hear, before I lost a day.

299
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,151
DL.

300
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,243
Did she...

301
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,911
Did I...

302
00:20:48,876 --> 00:20:50,160
Uhh!

303
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:52,920
Get up!

304
00:20:55,835 --> 00:21:00,013
- What did you do?
- What I had to do to get Micah back.

305
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:03,930
If you cared about Micah,
you wouldn't have taken those shots.

306
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:06,970
- You could have missed.
- I don't miss.

307
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:10,683
- You saw DL's jacket.
- DL's Micah's father.

308
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,390
DL is a criminal.

309
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:14,603
He brought danger
into our home.

310
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:18,070
- You want Micah to end up like that?
- You're wrong about him.

311
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:22,820
- You're out of control.
- What do you know about control, Niki?

312
00:21:23,035 --> 00:21:24,531
You're part of me.

313
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:29,990
- You do what I say.
- It doesn't work like that.

314
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,701
- Not anymore.
- Why are you doing this?

315
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:35,711
- Because you're not strong enough.
- Mom!

316
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,881
- Micah!
- Mom, is that you?

317
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,550
Coming!

318
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,141
- You're okay.
- Thanks to you.

319
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:58,902
Mr. Petrelli,
I'm Claire's father.

320
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:01,481
- Hi.
- You saved my little girl.

321
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,863
I owe you my life.

322
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:06,823
I was just in the right place.

323
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:11,201
Maybe one day I'll be in the right
place and can return the favor.

324
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:17,043
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

325
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,710
Hey, Dad, can you wait outside?

326
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,511
Of course.

327
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:35,933
How long have you known?

328
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:38,560
Known what?

329
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:41,521
That you're like me.

330
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,653
You  would have died
if you couldn't...

331
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,362
Wait, do you...

332
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:53,291
Do you heal? Is that it?

333
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,292
All this time,
I thought it was just me.

334
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,962
Now there's you.

335
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:02,970
Is that why you came for me?
Is that why you...

336
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,301
- asked me if I was the one?
- No, I just...

337
00:23:05,557 --> 00:23:07,551
I knew I had to save you.

338
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:12,891
- Why?
- To save the world.

339
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:17,022
- What do I have to do with the world?
- I don't know.

340
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,563
Yet.

341
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:26,492
I do know that I don't think I
would be here if it wasn't for you.

342
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:28,700
I think I died.

343
00:23:29,035 --> 00:23:33,080
I've died before.
It's no big deal.

344
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm not like you, Claire. I...

345
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:42,082
This, uh...

346
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:46,212
This healing thing is
kind of new for me.

347
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,563
Wait... you didn't know that you were
gonna heal when you dove off
the building?

348
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:51,053
No.

349
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:58,480
- That's kinda stupid, huh?
- No, it's not.

350
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:09,322
You're totally my hero.

351
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:18,582
Micah!

352
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,330
Mom? Mom, is that you?

353
00:24:22,547 --> 00:24:23,961
Mom!

354
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,763
- Dad's hurt.
- Where is he?

355
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:32,591
In there. He's bleeding... bad.

356
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:46,732
Stop fighting!

357
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,613
- Stop fighting!
- It's for your own good!

358
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:51,860
Micah!

359
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,123
Micah!

360
00:24:57,745 --> 00:24:59,290
Are you okay, son?

361
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:01,583
Micah...

362
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:04,370
Stay away from him!

363
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,503
It's me, baby.

364
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:15,220
Mom, is that you?

365
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:17,430
It's me.

366
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:33,951
I am so sorry.

367
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,371
I'm so sorry.

368
00:25:51,097 --> 00:25:53,010
- Hey.
- Hey.

369
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:54,861
So what have people
been saying?

370
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:58,070
Well, the official word is that
somebody got killed in the high school.

371
00:25:58,107 --> 00:26:02,001
But everybody knows it's Jackie. I got,
like, four text messages this morning.

372
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,983
- Did you bring the tapes?
- Oh, yeah.

373
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:08,232
There wasn't that
much to bring...

374
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:13,443
That's pretty destroyed, right?

375
00:26:13,828 --> 00:26:16,152
Yeah, I don't think
they're gonna play again.

376
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:19,453
Look... I feel really bad.

377
00:26:19,706 --> 00:26:23,090
About breaking you out and pushing you
to go to homecoming last night.
I'm sorry.

378
00:26:23,126 --> 00:26:24,872
You shouldn't feel bad.

379
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:27,040
You did it because
you're my friend.

380
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,963
Probably the best
friend I've ever had.

381
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,351
You know, I've only been
your friend for two weeks.

382
00:26:32,387 --> 00:26:34,880
Hey, I didn't say
it wasn't pathetic.

383
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:38,261
- You know, you could have been killed.
- I know.

384
00:26:40,187 --> 00:26:43,353
Look, I gotta go.
My dad just wanted to...

385
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,230
make sure that you weren't
gonna say anything to anyone.

386
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:50,860
- Of course. Cross my heart.
- Thanks, Zach.

387
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:13,053
- Hiro Nakamura, I presume.
- Mr. Isaac?

388
00:27:15,848 --> 00:27:18,222
This hasn't even gone
to the printer yet.

389
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:21,300
It's... it's incredible.

390
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,433
You really went to the future.

391
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:29,273
- Jumping through time, I mean...
- And space.

392
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:31,902
Your power very strong too.

393
00:27:32,656 --> 00:27:34,861
I'm not so sure about that.

394
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:37,693
I can only do it
when I'm chasing.

395
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:41,871
Uh, stoned. On drugs.

396
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:46,371
Uh... What else did
you see there... then?

397
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:48,502
Oh, um... I saw the bomb.

398
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:52,422
It exploded the city and
destroyed many things.

399
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:54,382
And I saw you.

400
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:57,670
What about me?

401
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:01,682
I saw you on the floor.

402
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,143
You were dead.

403
00:28:03,606 --> 00:28:06,641
With your head... cut... off.

404
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:09,351
Okay.

405
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:16,360
The man who cuts off heads...
he's taken care of.

406
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:23,203
- He's caught?
- That is very good news.

407
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,993
Hiro lost a friend.
The brain man killed her.

408
00:28:30,256 --> 00:28:31,790
Wait a minute.

409
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,633
I painted this two
days ago... sober.

410
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,261
- Is this your friend?
- Yes.

411
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:42,511
I did it.

412
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,430
You say your mission is to
stop the bomb. In New York.

413
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:50,930
- Yes, uh... our destiny.
- I think it may be mine too.

414
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:55,273
I painted that
mural on my floor.

415
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:58,111
And very recently,
I painted a picture of...

416
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:03,742
a man exploding.

417
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:06,701
How do you stop
an exploding man?

418
00:29:12,206 --> 00:29:13,201
Mom!

419
00:29:14,496 --> 00:29:15,580
Dad!

420
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:18,582
Mom's at the store.

421
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:20,082
I don't know where Dad is.

422
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,581
Did Dad talk to you?

423
00:29:23,585 --> 00:29:25,291
About what?

424
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,003
About me.

425
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:28,301
He knows.

426
00:29:28,677 --> 00:29:30,593
And he knows that you know.

427
00:29:31,096 --> 00:29:32,593
My thing.

428
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:36,102
That I can't get hurt.

429
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:43,863
- That didn't hurt?
- Lyle, I'm serious.

430
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,483
Now tell me what
Dad said to you.

431
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:49,083
I haven't seen Dad all day.

432
00:29:49,117 --> 00:29:52,493
- He was supposed to pick you up from practice.
- Well, he didn't.

433
00:29:52,748 --> 00:29:54,162
Well, how'd you get home?

434
00:29:57,336 --> 00:30:00,623
Lyle. How did you get home?

435
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:06,791
I-I don't remember.

436
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:13,801
- I can get you some help, Nik.
- You don't understand.

437
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:16,851
There are doctors that can help
with situations like this.

438
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:20,812
- D, she's stronger than me.
- I don't believe that for a second.

439
00:30:21,105 --> 00:30:22,810
You've seen what she can do!

440
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,403
How do you explain that?

441
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:28,862
There are a lot of things
that I can't explain.

442
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:32,402
- Like why you shot me.
- Jessica shot you.

443
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,821
And she's gonna come
back and take Micah.

444
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,161
She's out of control.

445
00:30:38,495 --> 00:30:40,333
She could really
hurt him, even...

446
00:30:43,546 --> 00:30:45,580
I can't be trusted.

447
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,710
Nik...

448
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,260
Micah.

449
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:56,841
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

450
00:30:57,058 --> 00:30:58,140
Come on.

451
00:30:58,518 --> 00:31:00,473
Gonna get you to a hotel.

452
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:02,562
We gonna get you cleaned up,
all right?

453
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,440
Nik, we're gonna
go to a hotel...

454
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,322
Nik?

455
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:18,531
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- Yeah, you can arrest me.

456
00:31:18,748 --> 00:31:20,541
Arrest you? For what?

457
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,373
Murder.

458
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:31,592
Really, Parkman.

459
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:34,882
Since when does absence of
noise warrant a stakeout?

460
00:31:35,138 --> 00:31:37,062
You always say I don't
take you anywhere.

461
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:39,430
Well, you sure know
how to spoil a girl.

462
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,311
Eat your tex-mex.

463
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:43,932
Gotta say, he can be cute.

464
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,563
Oh, God, did he just hear that?
Did you just read my mind?

465
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:51,361
You can't do that.

466
00:31:51,616 --> 00:31:53,153
It was a stray thought, I...

467
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:55,152
You can't do that.

468
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:58,410
You really think I'm,
uh... cute?

469
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,450
I really think you're married.

470
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:03,752
- And I really think you love your wife.
- I do.

471
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,223
Then why haven't you called to yell
at her, so you can go home already?

472
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,963
That's what you want, isn't it?

473
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:11,292
I don't wanna be a chump.

474
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:15,393
So still loving your wife after she has
sex with someone else makes you a chump?

475
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:17,382
- Doesn't it?
- Grow up, Parkman.

476
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:20,571
If you want your marriage to work,
you have to find a way to make it work.

477
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,352
Otherwise, you are
kind of a chump.

478
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:25,773
Cheerleader's dad, 9:00.

479
00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:31,020
That guy that's with him.
I know that guy.

480
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:33,730
- From where?
- He was at the bar...

481
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:36,532
the night I first
heard that static.

482
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:40,071
But how do you know?
I thought you lost that whole day.

483
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,953
Matt, maybe we should
get out of here.

484
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:49,041
Hold it,
I'm just trying to get... something.

485
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:07,731
- I was only able to get one word.
- What?

486
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:09,731
Sylar.

487
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:19,372
All right, Claire, I'm here.
What's the emergency?

488
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:21,161
Something's going on.

489
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,590
It's like The Stepford Body
Snatchers or something.

490
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:28,053
My brother doesn't
remember anything.

491
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,761
What I can do, nothing.

492
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:32,052
It's like they made him forget.

493
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:36,471
All right, so this is another one of
your little cheerleader
initiation pranks.

494
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:38,091
Is that it? Hmm, is it?

495
00:33:38,236 --> 00:33:40,583
Zach, are you listening to me?
Something is going on!

496
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:42,612
What is your damage?

497
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:45,843
Look, you haven't talked to me since
sixth grade, and now you call me out of
the blue?

498
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:48,161
What is this about?

499
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:53,243
They got to you too.

500
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,192
Are you on crystal meth or something?
'Cause this is really cracky behavior.

501
00:34:01,516 --> 00:34:02,891
Claire.

502
00:34:28,088 --> 00:34:32,290
You see yourself as some sort
of humanitarian, don't you?

503
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:37,132
A do-gooder, a hero. Kidnapping
men and women who are different.

504
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:39,180
Does that make
you feel powerful?

505
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:43,010
We're quite alike, you know.

506
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,852
You collect special people.

507
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:48,523
So do I.

508
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:53,023
We're gonna take
you apart, Gabriel.

509
00:34:54,026 --> 00:34:58,190
Like one of your little watches.
Sorry... timepieces.

510
00:34:58,536 --> 00:35:03,570
And we're gonna find out
exactly what makes you... tick.

511
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:21,011
I don't think I can do this.

512
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:26,060
Yes, you can. Concentrate.

513
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:59,212
- Hello?
- Tell me you remember.

514
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:02,803
Y-you remember what I told you?

515
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:04,473
Last night. Don't you?

516
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:06,273
You remember what
we talked about?

517
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,012
Of course I do.
What's going on?

518
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:11,771
You said that there were
people who wanted to hurt me.

519
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:14,153
I think they got
to Zach and Lyle.

520
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:16,193
They don't remember anything.

521
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:18,152
It's like it never happened.

522
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:20,112
I don't know what to do.

523
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:22,531
- Where are you?
- I'm at home.

524
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:24,530
Where's Mom?

525
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:29,661
- Where's... where's Lyle?
- Just stay where you are.

526
00:36:29,876 --> 00:36:32,870
I'll be right there.
I love you, Claire.

527
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:36,132
- You're gonna be okay.
- Okay.

528
00:36:42,885 --> 00:36:45,723
No! No! No!

529
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:52,181
I work for your father.

530
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:54,942
He sent me here to
make you forget.

531
00:36:55,488 --> 00:36:59,190
Like he sent me to your friend.
And your brother.

532
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:02,151
And to your mother
so many times.

533
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:04,902
He'll be here soon,
expecting that...

534
00:37:05,116 --> 00:37:07,201
you won't remember anything.

535
00:37:07,537 --> 00:37:11,203
But it is very
important that you do.

536
00:37:11,415 --> 00:37:13,043
Tell me, Claire.

537
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:17,831
Can you keep... a secret?

538
00:37:25,348 --> 00:37:27,592
What will we do once
he paints something?

539
00:37:29,557 --> 00:37:31,641
Maybe we should make
sure he is okay.

540
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,390
I thought he only
paint the future...

541
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:40,311
Oh no!

542
00:37:40,695 --> 00:37:42,232
What if I step on a bug?

543
00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:43,943
I could change history...

544
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:45,533
Change history?

545
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:47,151
You're gonna die!

546
00:37:50,996 --> 00:37:53,040
I really need to
find that sword...

547
00:37:59,045 --> 00:38:00,751
- Hello?
- Mohinder?

548
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:03,132
- It's me.
- Eden.

549
00:38:03,385 --> 00:38:05,631
Look, I'm not who
you think I am.

550
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:08,131
I lied to you,
and I'm really sorry.

551
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:10,432
And I'm gonna explain
it all to you soon.

552
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:12,350
Wh-where are you?
What's going on?

553
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:14,642
First, I need to
make things right.

554
00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:19,651
Starting with killing the
man who murdered your father.

555
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:22,063
Eden, wait, I...

556
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:31,951
I do know you, don't I?

557
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:36,660
I live next door
to Chandra Suresh.

558
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:40,422
That wonderful ability.

559
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:42,753
The power of persuasion,

560
00:38:43,098 --> 00:38:45,592
and this whole time,
you were the girl next door.

561
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,512
I'm gonna take this gun,

562
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:50,561
and I'm gonna put it in that slot.
You're gonna take it,

563
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:52,551
and you're gonna blow
your brains out.

564
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:54,510
You knew, didn't you?

565
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:59,642
You knew what I was,
and you let it continue.

566
00:38:59,895 --> 00:39:01,980
In a way, you helped me.

567
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:05,731
And after I've consumed your power,
you'll help me even more.

568
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:10,241
Oh, Eden,
you know that won't hurt me.

569
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:23,960
- What are you doing here, Nathan?
- Let's go.

570
00:39:24,217 --> 00:39:25,853
Aren't you gonna
ask what happened?

571
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:27,890
I know what happened.
You got yourself in trouble.

572
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:29,983
- You nearly got yourself killed.
- No, I saved a girl.

573
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:31,630
Had to be a hero, didn't you?

574
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:34,571
- Got it out of your system now?
- I finally get it now, Nathan.

575
00:39:34,608 --> 00:39:36,101
I have these dreams,

576
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:37,742
and when I'm around
someone with an ability,

577
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,033
- I can do what they can do.
- You look like hell.

578
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,873
And I was with that girl and that guy
that was trying to kill that girl.

579
00:39:42,908 --> 00:39:45,693
And this cop,
I think he was reading my mind.

580
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:47,790
- They were all like us.
- Dysfunctional?

581
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:49,071
No, they...

582
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:52,253
Nathan, I have to stop that bomb.
I have to save everybody.

583
00:39:52,285 --> 00:39:54,212
Right now,
I'd settle for you walking straight.

584
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:55,662
Peter? Peter!

585
00:41:51,825 --> 00:41:53,611
Easy. Easy.

586
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:55,450
It's all right. It's all right.

587
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:57,950
- It's all right.
- It's all my... fault.

588
00:41:58,577 --> 00:42:00,161
The explosion.

589
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,490
What are you talking about?

590
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:04,621
It's me.

591
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:10,840
Breathe. Breathe.

592
00:42:11,098 --> 00:42:14,840
Peter! Peter! Peter!

593
